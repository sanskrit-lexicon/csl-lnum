in his eighth incarnation, born as

[Kṛṣṇa is the most celebrated hero of
Indian mythology and the most popular
of all the deities. Though the real son of
Vasudeva and Devakī and thus a cousin
of Kaṃsa, he was, for all practical
purposes, the son of Nanda and Yaśodā
by whom he was brought up and in
whose house he spent his childhood. It
was here that his divine character began
to be gradually discovered, when he
easily crushed the most redoubtable
demons, such as Baka, Pūtanā &c., that
were sent to kill him by Kaṃsa, and
performed many other feats of <lbinfo n="surpri+sing"/>
[Page0421-c+ 61]
surprising strength. The chief companions
of his youth were the {%Gopīs%} or wives
of the cowherds of Gokula, among whom
Rādhā was his special favourite; (<ab>cf.</ab>
Jayadeva's {%Gītagovinda%}). He killed
Kaṃsa, Naraka, Keśin, Ariṣṭa and a
host of other powerful demons. He was
a particular friend of Arjuna, to whom
he acted as charioteer in the great war,
and his staunch support of the
cause of the Pāṇḍavas was the main
cause of the overthrow of the <lbinfo n="Kaura+vas"/>
Kauravas. On several critical occasions, it
was Kṛṣṇa's assistance and inventive
mind that stood the Pāṇḍavas in good
stead. After the general destruction of
the Yādavas at Prabhāsa, he was killed
unintentionally by a hunter named <lbinfo n="Ja+ras"/>
Jaras who shot him with an arrow <lbinfo n="mis+taking"/>
mistaking him at a distance for a deer. He
had more than 16000 wives, but <lbinfo n="Ruk+mi"/>
Rukmi{%ni%} and Satyabhāmā, (as also Rādhā)
were his favourites. He is said to have
been of dark-blue or cloud-like colour; <ab>cf.</ab>
