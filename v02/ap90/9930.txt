<ls>R. 6. 71.</ls> [Mythology relates that, when
in their war with the demons, the gods
were often worsted, they, headed by Indra,

went to the powerful king Puraṃjaya,
and requested him to be their friend
in battle. The latter consented to do so,
provided Indra carried him on his
shoulders. Indra accordingly assumed the
form of a bull, and Puraṃjaya, seated on
its hump, completely vanquished the <lbinfo n="de+mons"/>
demons. Puraṃjaya is, therefore, called  <lbinfo n="Ka+kutstha"/>
{%Kakutstha%} ‘standing on a hump’].
