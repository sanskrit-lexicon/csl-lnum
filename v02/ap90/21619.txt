[He was a son of Virocana, the son of
Prahlāda. He was a very powerful <lbinfo n="de+mon"/>
demon and oppressed the gods very much.
They, therefore, prayed to Viṣṇu for
succour, who descended on earth as a
son of Kaśyapa and Aditi in the form
of a dwarf. He assumed the dress of a
mendicant, and having gone to Bali
prayed him to give him as much earth
as he could cover in three steps. Bali,
who was noted for his liberality, <lbinfo n="un+hesitatingly"/>
unhesitatingly acceded to this apparently
simple request. But the dwarf soon <lbinfo n="as+sumed"/>
assumed a mighty form, and began to
measure the three steps. The first step
covered the earth, the second the
heavens; and not knowing where to
place the third, he planted it on the
head of Bali and sent him and all his
legions to the Pātāla and allowed him
to be its ruler. Thus the universe was
once more restored to the rule of Indra;
