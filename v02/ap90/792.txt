<><ls>Rv. 2. 8. 5.</ls> {#--triH#} <ab>N.</ab> of a celebrated sage
<>and author of many Vedic hymns.
<>[He appears in the Vedas in hymns
<>addressed to Agni, Indra, the Aśvins
<>and the Viśvedevas. In the <lbinfo n="Svāyam+bhuva"/>
<>Svāyambhuva Manvantara he appears as one
<>of the ten Prajāpatis or mind-born sons
<>of Brahmā, being born from his eye.
<>These sons having died by the curse of
<>Śiva, Brahmā performed a sacrifice, at
<>the beginning of the present Vaivasvata
<>Manvantara, and Atri was born from
<>the flames of Agni. Anasūyā was his
<>wife in both lives. In the first she bore
<>him three sons, Datta, Durvāsas and
<>Soma; in the second she had two <lbinfo n="addi+tional"/>
<>additional children, a son by name <lbinfo n="Arya+man"/>
<>Aryaman and a daughter called Amalā. In
<>the Rāmāyaṇa an account is given of
<>the visit paid by Rāma and Sītā to Atri
<>and Anasūyā in their hermitage, when
<>they both received them most kindly;
<>See Anasūyā. As a Ṛṣi or sage he is one
<>of the seven sages who were all sons of
<>Brahmā, and represents in Astronomy
<>one of the stars of the Great Bear <lbinfo n="situ+ated"/>
<>situated in the north. He is also the author
<>of a code of laws known as {#atrismfti#} or
<>{#atrisaMhitA#}. In the Purāṇas he is said to
<>have produced the moon from his eye,
<>while he was practising austere penance,
<>the moon being in consequence called
<>{#atrija, --jAta, --dfgja, atrinetraprasUta, --°praBava#},
<>{#°Bava#} &c.; <ab>cf.</ab> also {#aTa nayanasamutTaM#} <lbinfo n="jyoti#ratreriva"/>
