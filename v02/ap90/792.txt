{#adestriniSca, ad-trin#}] Devourer;  <lbinfo n="ls:Rv.+ 2. 8. 5."/>
<ls>Rv. 2. 8. 5.</ls> {#--triH#} <ab>N.</ab> of a celebrated sage
and author of many Vedic hymns.
[He appears in the Vedas in hymns
addressed to Agni, Indra, the Aśvins
and the Viśvedevas. In the <lbinfo n="Svāyam+bhuva"/>
Svāyambhuva Manvantara he appears as one
of the ten Prajāpatis or mind-born sons
of Brahmā, being born from his eye.
These sons having died by the curse of
Śiva, Brahmā performed a sacrifice, at
the beginning of the present Vaivasvata
Manvantara, and Atri was born from
the flames of Agni. Anasūyā was his
wife in both lives. In the first she bore
him three sons, Datta, Durvāsas and
Soma; in the second she had two <lbinfo n="addi+tional"/>
additional children, a son by name <lbinfo n="Arya+man"/>
Aryaman and a daughter called Amalā. In
the Rāmāyaṇa an account is given of
the visit paid by Rāma and Sītā to Atri
and Anasūyā in their hermitage, when
they both received them most kindly;
See Anasūyā. As a Ṛṣi or sage he is one
of the seven sages who were all sons of
Brahmā, and represents in Astronomy
one of the stars of the Great Bear <lbinfo n="situ+ated"/>
situated in the north. He is also the author
of a code of laws known as {#atrismfti#} or
{#atrisaMhitA#}. In the Purāṇas he is said to
have produced the moon from his eye,
while he was practising austere penance,
the moon being in consequence called
{#atrija, --jAta, --dfgja, atrinetraprasUta, --°praBava#},
{#°Bava#} &c.; <ab>cf.</ab> also {#aTa nayanasamutTaM#} <lbinfo n="jyoti#ratreriva"/>
