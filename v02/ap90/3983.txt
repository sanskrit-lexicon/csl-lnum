<ls>Rām.</ls> {#--DyA#} The capital of solar
kings, born of the line of Raghu,
(the modern Oudh) situated on
the river Sarayū. [It is said to have
extended 48 miles in length and 12 miles
in breadth. It was also called Sāketa,
and one of its suburbs was Nandi-grāma,
where Bharata governed the kingdom
during the absence of Rāma. The town
plays an important part in the story of
the Rāmāyaṇa; the second book ( <lbinfo n="ayo#DyAkAMqa"/>
{#ayoDyAkAMqa#}) dealing mostly with events
that took place in that city during the
youthful days of Rāma.]
