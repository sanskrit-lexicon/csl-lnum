[He was begotten by Vyāsa on <lbinfo n="Am+bālikā"/>

curse from having progeny himself; so
he allowed his first wife Kuntī to make
use of a charm she had acquired
from Durvāsas for the birth of sons.
She gave birth to Yudhiṣṭhira,
Bhīma and Arjuna; and Mādrī, his
other wife, by the use of the same
charm, gave birth to Nakula and <lbinfo n="Saha+deva"/>
Sahadeva. One day {%Pāṇḍu%} forgot the curse
under which he was labouring, and made
bold to embrace Mādrī, but he fell
immediately dead in her arms.]
