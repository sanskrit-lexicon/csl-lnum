want of symmetry or regularity, the
breaking of arrangement, regarded
as a fault of composition. It is the
same as {#BagnaprakramatA#} mentioned in  <lbinfo n="ls:K. P.+ 7"/>
<ls>K. P. 7</ls>, the break of symmetry being
either in expression or <lbinfo n="construc+tion"/>
construction; {#nATe niSAyA niyaterniyogAdastaM gate#}
{#haMta niSApi yAtA#} is an instance of the
former, where {#gatA niSApi#} would <lbinfo n="re+lieve"/>
relieve the irregularity of expression;
and {#viSrabDaM kriyatAM varAhatatiBirmustAkzatiH#} <lbinfo n="pa#lvale"/>
{#palvale#} is an instance of the latter,
where the symmetry of the verse <lbinfo n="re+quires"/>
requires the active instead of the <lbinfo n="pas+sive"/>
passive construction, and the fault may
be removed by reading the line as
{#viSrabDA racayaMtu SUkaravarA mustAkzatiM palvale#};
see <ls>K. P. 7</ls> under {#BagnaprakramatA#} for <lbinfo n="fur+ther"/>
