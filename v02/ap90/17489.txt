<P>{%Note%}. A few of the common
Nyāyas or popular maxims are here
collected for ready reference and <lbinfo n="ar+ranged"/>
arranged in alphabetical order.
<P>1. {#aMDacawakanyAyaH#} The maxim of
the blind man catching a sparrow,
analogous in sense to {#GuRAkzaranyAya#} <ab>q. v.</ab>
<P>2. {#aMDaparaMparAnyAyaH#} The maxim
of the blind following the blind.
It is used in those cases where <lbinfo n="peo+ple"/>
people blindly or thoughtlessly follow
others, not caring to see whether
their doing so would not be a leap
in the dark.
<P>3. {#aruMDatIdarSananyAyaH#} The maxim 
[Page0651-c+ 57]
of the view of the star Arundhatī.
The following explanation of <lbinfo n="Śan+karāchārya"/>
Śankarāchārya will make its use
clear: --{#aruMDatIM didarSayizustatsamIpasTAM#} <lbinfo n="sTU#lAM"/>
{#sTUlAM tArAmamuKyAM prayamamaruMDatIti grAhayitvA tAM#}
{#pratyAKyAya paScAdaruMDatImeva grAhayati#}.
<P>4. {#aSokavanikAnyAyaH#} The maxim
of the grove of Aśoka trees. <lbinfo n="Rāva+ṇa"/>
Rāvaṇa kept Sītā in the grove of Aśoka
trees, but it is not easy to account
for his preference of that particular
grove to any other one; so when
a man finds several ways of doing
a thing, any one of them may be
considered as good as another, and
the preference of any particular
one cannot be accounted for.
<P>5. {#aSmalozwranyAyaH#} The maxim of
the stone and clod of earth. A clod
of earth may be considered to be
hard as compared with cotton, but
is soft as compared with a stone.
So a person may be considered to
be very important as compared with
his inferiors, but sinks into <lbinfo n="insigni+ficance"/>
insignificance when compared with his <lbinfo n="bet+ters"/>
betters. The maxim is also used to <lbinfo n="de+note"/>
denote the {%relative%} importance of two
things, though absolutely both may
be bad; {%<ab>e. g.</ab>%} {#gopAlaparaSurAmO uBAvapi atIva#}
{#durmeDasO . kiMtu aSmalozwranyAyena gopAlaH#}
{#paraSurAmAdvarIyAn#}. <ab>cf.</ab> <ab>Mar.</ab> {#‘dagaqApekzAM#}
{#vIwa maU’#}. The maxim {#pAzARezwakanyAya#}
is similarly used.
<P>6. {#kadaMbakoraka(golaka)nyAyaH#}
The maxim of the Kadamba buds;
used to denote simultaneous rise or
action, like the bursting forth of
the buds of the Kadamba tree at one
and the same time.
<P>7. {#kAkatAlIyanyAyaH#} The maxim
of the crow and the palm-fruit. It
takes its origin from the unexpected
and sudden fall of a palm-fruit <lbinfo n="up+on"/>
upon the head of a crow (so as to kill
it) at the very moment of its
sitting on a branch of that tree;
and is used to denote a very <lbinfo n="unex+pected"/>
unexpected and accidental occurrence,
whether welcome or unwelcome; <ab>cf.</ab>

{#me yaSca suBruvaH .#} <lbinfo n="tadetatkAkatAlIyamavitarki#tasaMBavaM"/>

{#kAkatAlIya#} also.
<P>8. {#kAkadaMtagavezaRanyAyaH#} The <lbinfo n="ma+xim"/>
[Page0652-a+ 57]
maxim of searching after a crow's
teeth, used to denote any useless,
unprofitable, or impossible task.
<P>9. {#kAkAkzigolakanyAyaH#} The maxim
of the crow's eyeball. It takes its
origin from the supposition that
the crow has but one eye (<ab>cf.</ab> words
like {#ekadfzwi, ekAkza#} &c.), and that it
can move it, as occasion requires,
from the socket on one side into
that of the other; and the maxim
is applied to a word or phrase which,
though used only once in a sentence,
may, if occasion requires, serve two
purposes; {%<ab>e. g.</ab>%} {#dvIpo'striyAmaMtarIpaH#} <lbinfo n="i#tyatra"/>
{#ityatra astriyAmityasya kAkAkzigolakanyAyema#}
{#aMtarIpaSabdenApyanvayaH#}.
<P>10. {#kUpayaMtraGAwikAnyAyaH#} The <lbinfo n="ma+xim"/>
maxim of the buckets attached to the
water-wheel. It takes its origin
from the fact that while some of
the buckets filled with water go up,
some are emptied of their contents,
while others go down quite empty;
and is used to denote the various
vicissitudes of worldly existence;
<ab>cf.</ab> --{#kAMScittucCayati prapUrayati vA#} <lbinfo n="kAMScinnaya#tyunnatiM"/>
{#kAMScinnayatyunnatiM kAMScitpAtaviDO karoti ca punaH#} <lbinfo n="kAM#ScinnayatyAkulAn"/>

{#kUpayaMtraGawikAnyAyaprasakto viDiH ..#} <ls>Mk. 10. 59.</ls>
<P>11. {#GawwakuwIpraBAtanyAyaH#} The <lbinfo n="ma+xim"/>
maxim of day-break near a toll-station.
It takes its origin from the attempt
of one (say, a cartman) who with
the intention of avoiding a toll
takes at night an unfrequented
road, but unfortunately finds <lbinfo n="him+self"/>
himself at day-break near that very <lbinfo n="toll+station"/>
tollstation, and is obliged to pay the
toll which he studiously tried to
avoid. Thus the maxim is used to
denote the occurrence of that which
one studiously tries to avoid; <ab>cf.</ab>
Śrīharṣa: --{#tadidaM#} <lbinfo n="GawwakuwIpraBAtanyAyamanu#vadati"/>
{#GawwakuwIpraBAtanyAyamanuvadati#}.
<P>12. {#GuRAkzaranyAyaH#} The maxim of
letters bored by an insect in wood.
It takes its origin from the <lbinfo n="unex+pected"/>
unexpected and chance resemblance of
an incision in wood or in the leaf
of a book made by an insect to the
form of some letter, and is used to
denote any fortuitous or chance <lbinfo n="oc+currence"/>
occurrence.
<P>13. {#daMqApUpanyAyaH#} The maxim of
the stick and cakes. When a stick 
[Page0652-b+ 57]
and cakes are tied together, and one
says that ‘the stick has been <lbinfo n="pull+ed"/>
pulled down or eaten by a rat’, we are
naturally led to expect that
the cakes also have been <lbinfo n="pul+led"/>
pulled down or eaten by the rat,
as a matter of course, the two being
so closely connected together; so,
when one thing is closely connected
with another in a particular way,
and we say something of the one, it
naturally follows that what we <lbinfo n="as+sert"/>
assert of the one can, as a matter of
course, be asserted of the other;
<ab>cf.</ab> --{#mUzikeRa daMqo BakzitaH ityanena#} <lbinfo n="ta#tsahacaritamapUpaBakzaRamarTAdAyAtaM"/>
{#tatsahacaritamapUpaBakzaRamarTAdAyAtaM BavatIti#} <lbinfo n="niya#tasamAnanyAyAdarTAMtaramApatatItyeza"/>
{#niyatasamAnanyAyAdarTAMtaramApatatItyeza nyAyo#} <lbinfo n="daMqA#pUpikA"/>
{#daMqApUpikA ..#} <ls>S. D. 10.</ls>
<P>14 {#dehalIdIpanyAyaH#} The maxim
of the lamp placed over the <lbinfo n="thresh+old"/>
threshold. It takes its origin from a
lamp hanging over the threshold of
a house which, by its peculiar <lbinfo n="po+sition"/>
position, serves to light the rooms on
both sides, and is used to denote
something which serves a two-fold
purpose at the same time.
<P>15. {#nfpanApitaputranyAyaH#} The maxim
of the king and barber's son. It is
used to denote a man's innate <lbinfo n="fond+ness"/>
fondness for his own <lbinfo n="possession-how+soever"/>
possession-howsoever ugly or despicable in the
eyes of others. It takes its origin
from a story which states that a
king on one occasion asked his
barber to bring to him the finest boy
that he could see in his kingdom.
The barber roamed for a long time
over every part of the realm, but
could discover no boy such as the
king wanted. At last wearied and
disappointed, he returned home; and
being charmed with the beauty
of his own boy-who, to do him
justice, was a personification of <lbinfo n="ug+liness"/>
ugliness and deformity-went to the
king and presented the boy to him.
The king was at first very angry with
the barber for having trifled with
him, but on consideration excused
him, as he ascribed the barber's <lbinfo n="pre+ference"/>
preference of his own ugly boy to the
dominant desire of human beings
to consider their own possessions
as supremely good; <ab>cf.</ab> -{#sarvaH kAMtamAtmIyaM#}
{#paSyati#} <ls>Ś. 2.</ls>
<P>16. {#paMkaprakzAlananyAyaH#} The maxim 
[Page0652-c+ 57]
of washing off the mud. Just as it
is more advisable for one to avoid
getting into mud than to get into
it and then wash it off, so it is
more advisable for one to avoid
getting into danger than to expose
oneself to it and then try to get out
of it somehow or other; <ab>cf.</ab>  <lbinfo n="prakzAlanA#dDi"/>
--{#prakzAlanAdDi paMkasya dUrAdasparSanaM varaM#}; and also <lbinfo n="“Pre+vention"/>
“Prevention is better than cure”.
<P>17. {#pizwapezaRanyAyaH#} The maxim of
grinding flour or meal, used to <lbinfo n="de+note"/>
denote a superfluous or unprofitable
exertion like the attempt of a man
to grind pounded flour; <ab>cf.</ab> {#kftasya#}
{#karaRaM vfTA#}.
<P>18. {#bIjAMkuranyAyaH#} The maxim of
seed and sprout. It takes its origin
from the relation of mutual <lbinfo n="causa+tion"/>
causation which subsists between seed
and sprout, ({%seed%} being the cause
of {%sprout%}, which in its turn is the
cause of {%seed%}); and is used in those
cases where two things stand to each
other in the relation of both cause
and effect.
<P>19. {#lohacuMbakanyAyaH#} The maxim of
iron and magnet; it is used to
denote a very close affinity between
two things, by virtue of which they
are instinctively attracted towards
each other, though at a distance.
<P>20. {#vahniDUmanyAyaH#} The maxim of
the invariable concomitance of fire
and smoke; (wherever there is
smoke there is fire.). It is used to
denote such invariable <lbinfo n="concomi+tance"/>
concomitance between two persons or
things; ({%<ab>e. g.</ab>%} where there is A,
there is B; where there is not B,
there is not Ā.).
<P>21. {#vizakfminyAyaH#} The maxim of
the worms bred in poison. It is used
to denote a state of things which,
though fatal to others, is not so
to those who being bred in it, are
inured or naturalized to it, like
poison which, though fatal to
others, is not so to the worms bred
in it.
<P>22. {#vizavfkzanyAyaH#} The maxim of
the poison-tree; used to denote
that a thing, though hurtful and
mischievous, does not deserve to be
destroyed by the very person who
has reared it, just as even a <lbinfo n="poison+tree"/>
poisontree ought not to be cut down by 
[Page0653-a+ 43]
the planter himself.
<P>23. {#vIcitaraMganyAyaH#} The maxim of
a wave urging forward a wave. In
the ocean one wave propels another
till the first and all others in
succession reach the shore. So this
maxim is used to denote successive
operation, as in the case of the <lbinfo n="pro+duction"/>
production of sound.
<P>24. {#vfdDakumArIvAkya(vara)nyAyaH#}
The maxim of the old virgin's boon;
that is, asking such a boon as will
cover all that one wishes to have.
The Mahābhāṣya says that an old
virgin, when asked by Indra to
choose a boon, said; {#--putrA me#} <lbinfo n="bahukzI#raGftamodanaM"/>
{#bahukzIraGftamodanaM kAMcanapAtryAM BuMjIran#}. This
one boon, if granted, would give
her a husband, progeny, abundance
of corn, cattle &c., and gold.
<P>25. {#SAKAcaMdranyAyaH#} The maxim of
the bough and the moon. As the
moon, though considerably distant
from the bough of a tree, is spoken
of as ‘the moon on the bough,’ <lbinfo n="be+cause"/>
because she appears to be near it, so
this maxim is used when the <lbinfo n="posi+tion"/>
position of an object, though at a very
great distance, is fixed by that of
another object to which it appears
to be contiguous.
<P>26. {#siMhAvalokananyAyaH#} The <lbinfo n="ma+xim"/>
maxim of the lion's backward glance.
It is used when one casts a <lbinfo n="retro+spective"/>
retrospective glance at what he has left
behind, while at the same time he
is proceeding, just as the lion, while
going onward in search of prey, now
and then bends his neck backwards
to see if anything be within his
reach; see under {#siMha#} also.
<P>27. {#sUcIkawAhanyAyaH#} The maxim
of the needle and the kettle. It is 
[Page0653-b+ 43]
used to denote that when two
things-the one easy and the other
difficult-are required to be done,
the easier should be first attended
to, as when one has to prepare a
needle and a kettle, he should first
take in hand a needle as it is an
easier work compared with the <lbinfo n="pre+paration"/>
preparation of a kettle.
<P>28. {#sTAlIpulAkanyAyaH#} The maxim
of the cooking-pot and boiled rice.
In a cooking-pot all the grains <lbinfo n="be+ing"/>
being equally moistened by the <lbinfo n="heat+ed"/>
heated water, when one grain is found
to be well cooked, the same may
be inferred with regard to the
other grains. So the maxim is
used when the condition of the
whole class is inferred from that of
a part; <ab>cf.</ab> <ab>Mar.</ab> ‘{#SitAvarUna BAtAcI#} <lbinfo n="pa#rIkzA"/>
{#parIkzA#}’.
<P>29. {#sTURAniKanananyAyaH#} The <lbinfo n="max+im"/>
maxim of digging or fixing in the post.
As a stake or post to be firmly <lbinfo n="fix+ed"/>
fixed in the ground is again and again
moved and thrust inward, so this
maxim is used when one (say, a <lbinfo n="dis+putant"/>
disputant) adds several corroborative
illustrations, arguments &c. to
strengthen and confirm still more
his strong position.
<P>30. {#svAmiBftyanyAyaH#} The maxim of
master and servant. It is used to
mark the relation of the feeder and
the fed, or the supporter and the
supported, subsisting between any
two objects.
