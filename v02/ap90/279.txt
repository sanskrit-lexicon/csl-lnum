{#saMGadfyannaMgadamaMgadena#} <ls>R. 6. 73.</ls> {#--dA#} {@1@} The female
elephant of the south (?). {@--2@} A <lbinfo n="wo+man"/>

({#aMgaM dadAti arpayati#}). {#--daH#} {@1@} <ab>N.</ab> of a son
of Vāli, monkey-king of <lbinfo n="Kish+kindhā"/>
Kishkindhā. [He was born of Tārā, Vālī's
wife, and is supposed to have been an
incarnation of Bṛhaspati to aid the
cause of Rāma (and hence noted for his
eloquence). When, after the abduction
of Sītā by Rāvaṇa, Rāma sent monkeys
in all quarters to search for her, Aṅgada
was made chief of a monkey-troop <lbinfo n="pro+ceeding"/>
proceeding to the south. For one month
he got no information, and, when <lbinfo n="conse+quently"/>
consequently he determined to cast off his
life, he was told by Sampāti that Sītā
could be found in Laṅkā. He sent
Māruti to the island and, on the latter's
return with definite information, they
joined Rāma at Kiṣkindhā. <lbinfo n="After+wards"/>
Afterwards when the whole host of Rāma
went to Laṅkā Aṅgada was despatched
to Rāvaṇa as a messenger of peace to
give him a chance of saving himself in
time. But Rāvaṇa scornfully rejected
his advice and met his doom. After
Sugrīva Aṅgada became king of <lbinfo n="Kish+kindhā"/>
Kishkindhā. In common parlance a man 
[Page0020-a+ 59]
is said to act the part of Aṅgada when
he endeavours to mediate between two
contending parties, but without any <lbinfo n="suc+cess"/>
success.]. {@--2@} <ab>N.</ab> of a son of Lakṣmaṇa
by Urmilā (<ls>R. 15.</ls>90), his <lbinfo n="capi+tal"/>
capital being called Aṅgadīyā. {@--3@} <ab>N.</ab>
of a warrior on the side of <lbinfo n="Duryo+dhana"/>
Duryodhana. {@--Comp.@} {#--niryUhaH#} the crest-like
forepart of the Aṅgada ornament.
