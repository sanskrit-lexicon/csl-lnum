{#bAloyaM tasmAnnAmnA Bavizyati ..#}] <ab>N.</ab> of a
celebrated Brāhmaṇa warrior and
general on the side of the <lbinfo n="Kaura+vas"/>
Kauravas, son of Droṇa and Kṛpī.
[After the last great battle in which
Duryodhana was mortally wounded,
Aśvatthāman, with two other surviving
Kauravas, entered the Pāṇḍava camp at
night, where he stamped Dhṛṣṭadyumna,
the slayer of his father, to death and <lbinfo n="kill+ed"/>
killed the five young sons of the Pāṇḍavas,
killing even Parīkṣit while yet in the
mother's womb who was, however, <lbinfo n="re+stored"/>
restored to life by Kṛṣṇa. The next <lbinfo n="morn+ing"/>
morning Draupadī clamoured for revenge <lbinfo n="up+on"/>
upon the murderer of her children, but she
consented to forego her demand for his
blood if the precious jewel he wore on
his head were brought to her. Bhīma,
Arjuna, and Kṛṣṇa overtook <lbinfo n="Aśvatthā+man"/>
Aśvatthāman and compelled him to yield the jewel
which Yudhiṣṭhira afterwards wore
on his head. He is represented as a very
brave, fiery-tempered, young warrior, the
embodiment of Brāhmaṇic and saintly <lbinfo n="lus+tre"/>
lustre, and his altercation with Karṇa about
the nomination of a general to succeed
Droṇa clearly brings out the chief <lbinfo n="fea+tures"/>
[Page0205-b+ 61]
features of his character; see <ls>Ve. 3</ls>rd act.
He is one of the 7 {%Cirajīvins%} ‘ever
living persons’].
