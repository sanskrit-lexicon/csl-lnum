<>Kauravas, son of Droṇa and Kṛpī.
<>[After the last great battle in which
<>Duryodhana was mortally wounded,
<>Aśvatthāman, with two other surviving
<>Kauravas, entered the Pāṇḍava camp at
<>night, where he stamped Dhṛṣṭadyumna,
<>the slayer of his father, to death and <lbinfo n="kill+ed"/>
<>killed the five young sons of the Pāṇḍavas,
<>killing even Parīkṣit while yet in the
<>mother's womb who was, however, <lbinfo n="re+stored"/>
<>restored to life by Kṛṣṇa. The next <lbinfo n="morn+ing"/>
<>morning Draupadī clamoured for revenge <lbinfo n="up+on"/>
<>upon the murderer of her children, but she
<>consented to forego her demand for his
<>blood if the precious jewel he wore on
<>his head were brought to her. Bhīma,
<>Arjuna, and Kṛṣṇa overtook <lbinfo n="Aśvatthā+man"/>
<>Aśvatthāman and compelled him to yield the jewel
<>which Yudhiṣṭhira afterwards wore
<>on his head. He is represented as a very
<>brave, fiery-tempered, young warrior, the
<>embodiment of Brāhmaṇic and saintly <lbinfo n="lus+tre"/>
<>lustre, and his altercation with Karṇa about
<>the nomination of a general to succeed
<>Droṇa clearly brings out the chief <lbinfo n="fea+tures"/>
[Page0205-b+ 61]

<>He is one of the 7 {%Cirajīvins%} ‘ever
