{#mAMDAtf#}¦ {%<ab>m.</ab>%} <ab>N.</ab> of a king of the
solar race, son of Yuvanāśva <lbinfo n="(be+ing"/>
(being born from his own belly). As
soon as he came out of the belly,
the sages said {#‘kaM eza DAsyati’#}; <lbinfo n="where+upon"/>
whereupon Indra came down and said
{#‘mAM DAsyati’#}; the boy was, therefore,
called Māndhātṛ.
