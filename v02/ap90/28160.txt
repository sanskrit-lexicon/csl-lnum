<>Rāvaṇa. [She was attracted by the beauty

[Page1053-a+ 58]
<>her. But he said that as he had already
<>got a wife she had better go to <lbinfo n="Laksh+maṇa"/>
<>Lakshmaṇa and try him. But he too rejected
<>her, and back she came to Rāma. This
<>circumstance excited Sītā's laughter,
<>and the revengeful demoness, feeling
<>herself grossly insulted, assumed a <lbinfo n="hide+ous"/>
<>hideous form and threatened to eat her up.
<>But Lakṣmaṇa cut off her ears and
<>nose, and thus doubly deformed her; see
