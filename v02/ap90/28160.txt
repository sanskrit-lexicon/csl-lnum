{#SUrpaH --rpaM#}¦ A winnowing-basket. {#--rpaH#}
A measure of two Droṇas. {@--Comp.@}
{#--karRaH#} an elephant. {#--RaKA#} (for
{#naKA#}) ‘having finger-nails like <lbinfo n="win+nowing"/>
winnowing-baskets’, <ab>N.</ab> of a sister of <lbinfo n="Rā+vaṇa"/>
Rāvaṇa. [She was attracted by the beauty
of Rāma, and solicited him to marry 
[Page1053-a+ 58]
her. But he said that as he had already
got a wife she had better go to <lbinfo n="Laksh+maṇa"/>
Lakshmaṇa and try him. But he too rejected
her, and back she came to Rāma. This
circumstance excited Sītā's laughter,
and the revengeful demoness, feeling
herself grossly insulted, assumed a <lbinfo n="hide+ous"/>
hideous form and threatened to eat her up.
But Lakṣmaṇa cut off her ears and
nose, and thus doubly deformed her; see
<ls>R. 12. 32-40</ls>]. {#--vAtaH#} wind produced
by shaking a winnowing-basket.
{#--SrutiH#} an elephant.
