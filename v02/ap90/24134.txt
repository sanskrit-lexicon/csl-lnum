{#kzatarakzaRaM divaH#} <ls>Śi. 1. 48</ls> [He was the son
of Viśravas by Keśinī or Kaikasī and
so half-brother of Kubera. He is called
{%Paulastya%} as being a grandson of the
sage Pulastya. Laṅkā was originally
occupied by Kubera, but Rāvaṇa ousted
him from it and made it his own <lbinfo n="capi+tal"/>
capital. He had ten heads (and hence his
names Daśagrīva, Daśavadana &c.)
and twenty arms, and according to
some, four legs (<ab>cf.</ab> <ls>R. 12. 88</ls> and
<ls>Malli.</ls>). He is represented to have
practised the most austere penance
for ten thousand years in order to
propitiate the god Brahman, and to
have offered one head at the end of
each one thousand years. Thus he offered
nine of his heads and was going to offer
the tenth when the God was pleased
and granted him immunity from death
by either god or man. On the strength
of this boon he grew very tyrannical
and oppressed all beings. His power
became so great that even the gods are
said to have acted as his domestic <lbinfo n="ser+vanta"/>
servanta. He conquered almost all the
kings of the day, but is said to have
been imprisoned by Kārtavīrya for 
[Page0912-a+ 60]
some time when he went to attack his
territory. On one occasion he tried to
uplift the Kailāsa mountain, but Śiva
pressed it down so as to crush his <lbinfo n="fin+gers"/>
fingers under it. He, therefore, hymned
Śiva for one thousand years so loudly
that the God gave him the name {%Rāvaṇa%}
and freed him from his painful position.
But though he was so powerful and <lbinfo n="in+vincible"/>
invincible, the day of retribution drew
near. While Rāma-who was Viṣṇu
descended on earth for the destruction
of this very demon-was passing his
years of exile in the forest, Rāvaṇa
carried off his wife Sitā and urged her
to become his wife; but she persistently
refused and remained loyal to her <lbinfo n="hus+band"/>
husband. At last Rāma assisted by his
monkey-troops invaded Laṅkā, <lbinfo n="annihi+lated"/>
annihilated Rāvaṇa's troops and killed the
demon himself. He was a worthy <lbinfo n="op+ponent"/>
opponent of Rāma, and hence the <lbinfo n="expres+sion"/>
