<><ab>N.</ab> of a king of Mathurā, son of
<>Ugrasena and enemy of Kṛṣṇa.
<>[He is identified with the Asura <lbinfo n="Kāla+nemi"/>
<>Kālanemi, and acted inimically towards
<>Kṛṣṇa and became his implacable foe.
<>The circumstance which made him so
<>was the following. While, after the <lbinfo n="mar+riage"/>
<>marriage of Devakī with Vasudeva, he was
<>driving the happy pair home, a heavenly
<>voice warned Kaṃsa that the eighth
<>child of Devakī would kill him. <lbinfo n="Thereup+on"/>
<>Thereupon he threw both of them into prison,
<>loaded them with strong fetters, and
<>kept the strictest watch over them.
<>He took from Devakī every child as
<>soon as it was born and slew it, and in
<>this way he disposed of her first six <lbinfo n="child+ren"/>
<>children. But the 7th and 8th, Balarāma
<>and Kṛṣṇa, were safely conveyed to
<>Nanda's house in spite of his vigilance,
<>and Kṛṣṇa grew up to be his slayer
<>according to the prophecy. When Kaṃsa
<>heard this, he was very much enraged and
<>sent several demons to kill Kṛṣṇa,
<>but he killed them all with ease. At last
<>he sent Akrūra to bring the boys to
<>Mathurā. A severe duel was fought
<>between Kaṃsa and Kṛṣṇa, in which
<>the former was slain by the latter].
