[Different writers give different accounts
of this lady. According to <lbinfo n="Kathāsarit+sāgara"/>
Kathāsaritsāgara she was the daughter of king
Caṇḍamahāsena of Ujjayinī and was
carried off by Udayana, king of Vatsa.
Śrīharṣa represents her to be the <lbinfo n="daugh+ter"/>
daughter of king Pradyota (see <ls>Ratn. 1. 10</ls>),
and, according to Mallinātha's comment
on the line {#pradyotasya priyaduhitaraM vatsarAjo'tra#}
{#jahre#} she was the daughter of Pradyota
king of Ujjayinī. Bhavabhūti says that
she was betrothed by her father to king
Saṃjaya, but that she offered herself to
Udayana; (see <ls>Māl. 2</ls>). But the
Vāsavadattā of Subandhu has nothing in
common with the story of Vatsa, except
the name of the heroine, as she is <lbinfo n="re+presented"/>
represented to have been betrothed by
her father to Puṣpaketu, but carried off
by Kandarpaketu. It is probable that
there were several heroines bearing the
name Vāsavadattā.].
