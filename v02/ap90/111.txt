<><ab>N.</ab> of a Yādava, a friend and uncle
<>of Kṛṣṇa. [It was he who induced
<>Rāma and Kṛṣṇa to go to Mathurā
<>and kill Kaṃsa. He told the two <lbinfo n="bro+thers"/>
<>brothers how their father Ānaka-Dundubhi,
<>the princess Devakī and even his own
<>father Ugrasena had been insulted by
<>the iniquitous demon Kaṃsa, and told
<>them why he had been despatched to
<>them. Kṛṣṇa consented to go and
<>promised to slay the demon within 3
<>nights, which he succeeded in doing.]
