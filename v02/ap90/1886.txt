{#anuvAdya#}¦ {%<ab>pot. p.</ab>%} {@1@} To be explained
or illustrated. {@--2@} (In <ab>gram.</ab>) To be
made the subject of an assertion (in a
sentence), opposed to {#viDeya#} which
affirms or denies something about
the subject. In a sentence the  <lbinfo n="anu#vAdya"/>
{#anuvAdya#} or subject which is supposed to
be already known is repeated to
mark its connection with the {#viDeya#} or
predicate and should be placed first;
{#anuvAdyamanuktvEva na viDeyamudIrayet#}; in
{#vfdDirAdEc AdEc#} should have been
placed first, though the <lbinfo n="construc+tion"/>
construction is defended by Patañjali.
