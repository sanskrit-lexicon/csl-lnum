[He was a descendant of Bhṛgu, (the
son of Cyavana by his wife Āruṣī, and
grandson of Bhṛgu). The Mahābhārata
relates that the sons of Kārtavīrya, with
the desire of destroying the descendants
of Bhṛgu, killed even the children in the
womb. One of the women of the family in
order to preserve her embryo secreted it
in her thigh ({%ūru%}), whence the child
at its birth was called Aurva. Beholding
him the sons of Kārtavīrya were
struck with blindness, and his
wrath gave rise to a flame which
threatened to consume the whole
world, had he not, at the desire
of his Pitṛs, the Bhārgavas, cast it
into the ocean, where it remained <lbinfo n="con+cealed"/>
concealed with the face of a horse; <ab>cf.</ab>
Vaḍavāgni. Aurva was afterwards
