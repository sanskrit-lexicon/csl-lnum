[Page0790-a+ 63]
strong Rāma’, <ab>N.</ab> of the elder <lbinfo n="bro+ther"/>
brother of Kṛṣṇa. [He was the seventh
son of Vasudeva and Devakī; but <lbinfo n="trans+ferred"/>
transferred to the womb of Rohiṇi to save
him from falling a prey to the cruelty of
Kaṃsa. He and his brother Kṛṣṇa
were brought up by Nanda in Gokula.
When quite young, he killed the <lbinfo n="power+ful"/>
powerful demons Dhenuka and Pralamba, and
performed, like his brother, many feats
of surprising strength. On one occasion
Balarāma under the influence of wine, of
which he was very fond, called upon the
Yamunā river to come to him that he
might bathe; and on his command being
unheeded, he plunged his plough-share
into the river and dragged the waters
after him, until the river assumed a <lbinfo n="hu+man"/>
human form and asked his forgiveness.
On another occasion he dragged towards
himself the whole city of Hastināpura
along with its walls. As Kṛṣṇa was a
friend and admirer of the Pāṇḍavas, so
Balarāma was of the Kauravas, as was
seen in his desire of giving his sister <lbinfo n="Su+bhadrā"/>
Subhadrā to Duryodhana rather than to
Arjuna; yet he declined to take any part
in the great Bhāratī war either with the
Pāṇḍavas or the Kauravas. He is <lbinfo n="re+presented"/>
represented as dressed in blue clothes, and
armed with a ploughshare which was his
most effective weapon. His wife was
Revatī. He is sometimes regarded as an
incarnation of the serpent Śeṣa and
sometimes as the eighth incarnation of
Viṣṇu; see the quotation under {#hala#}].
