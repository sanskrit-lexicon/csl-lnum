of one of the six systems of Hindu
philosophy, attributed to the sage
Kapila; (this philosophy is so <lbinfo n="cal+led"/>
called because it ‘enumerates’ <lbinfo n="twenty+five"/>
twentyfive {%Tattvas%} or true principles; and
its chief object is to effect the final
emancipation of the twenty-fifth
{%Tattva%}, {%<ab>i. e.</ab>%} the {%Puruṣa%} or soul,
from the bonds of this worldly
existence-the fetters of <lbinfo n="phenome+nal"/>
phenomenal creation-by conveying a correct
knowledge of the twenty-four other
{%Tattvas%} and by properly <lbinfo n="discrimi+nating"/>
discriminating the Soul from them. It
regards the whole universe as a
development of an inanimate <lbinfo n="prin+ciple"/>
principle called Prakṛti <ab>q. v.</ab>, while
the {%Puruṣa%} is altogether passive
and simply a looker-on. It <lbinfo n="a+grees"/>
agrees with the Vedānta in <lbinfo n="be+ing"/>
being synthetical and so differs from
the analytical Nyāya or Vaiśeṣika;
but its great point of divergence
from the Vedānta is that it <lbinfo n="main+tains"/>
maintains two principles which the <lbinfo n="Ve+dānta"/>
Vedānta denies, and that it does not
admit God as the creator and <lbinfo n="con+troller"/>
controller of the universe, which the
Vedānta affirms); {#sAMKyamiva#} <lbinfo n="kapilA#DizWitaM"/>
