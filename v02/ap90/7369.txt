{#--drA#} The wife of Indra, Indrāṇī.
[Indra, the god of the firmament, is
the Jupiter Pluvius of the Indian Āryans.
In the Vedas he is placed in the first
rank among the gods; yet he is not
regarded as an uncreated being, being
distinctly spoken of in various passages
of the Vedas as being born, and as having
a father and a mother. He is sometimes
represented as having been produced by
the gods as a destroyer of enemies, as
the son of Ekāṣṭakā, and in  <lbinfo n="ls:Rv. 10. 90.+ 13"/>
<ls>Rv. 10. 90. 13</ls> he is said to have sprung from the
mouth of Puruṣa. He is of a ruddy or
golden colour, and can assume any form
at will. He rides in a bright golden
chariot drawn by two tawny horses. His
most famous weapon is the thunderbolt
which he uses with deadly effect in his
warfare with the demons of darkness,
drought and inclement weather, variously
called Ahi, Vṛtra, Śambara, Namuci
&c. He storms and breaks through
their castles, and sends down fertilizing
showers of rain to the great delight of
his worshippers. He is thus the lord of
the atmosphere, the dispenser of rain,
and governor of the weather. He is <lbinfo n="re+presented"/>
represented as being assisted by the Maruts
or storm-gods in his warfare. Besides
the thunderbolt he uses arrows, a large
hook, and a net. The Soma juice is his
most favourite food, and under its <lbinfo n="ex+hilarating"/>
exhilarating influence he performs great
achievements (<ab>cf.</ab> <ls>Rv. 10. 119</ls>), and pleases
his devout worshippers, who are said to
invite the god to drink the juice. He is
their friend and even their brother; a
father, and the most fatherly of fathers;
the helper of the poor, and the deliverer
and comforter of his servants. He is a
wall of defence; his friend is never slain
or defeated. He richly rewards his adorers,
particularly those who bring him
libations of Soma, and he is supplicated
for all sorts of temporal blessings, as
cows, horses, chariots, health, <lbinfo n="intel+ligence"/>
intelligence, prosperous days, long life, and
victory in war. In the Vedas Indra's
wife is Indr{%ani%}, who is invoked among
the goddesses.
<P>Such is the Vedic conception of
Indra. But in later mythology he falls
in the second rank. He is said to
be one of the sons of Kaśyapa and
Dākṣāyaṇī or Aditi. He is inferior
to the triad Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśa
(though in some places Viṣṇu is <lbinfo n="regard+ed"/>
regarded as his younger brother, <ab>cf.</ab> <ls>R. 14. 59</ls>,
<ls n="R.">15. 40</ls>), but he is the chief of all the
other gods, and is commonly styled
Sureśa, Devendra &c. As in the Vedas
so in later mythology, he is the regent of
the atmosphere, and of the east quarter,
and his world is called Svarga. He sends 
[Page0277-c+ 67]
the lightning, uses the thunderbolt and
sends down rain. He is frequently at
war with Asuras, whom he constantly
dreads, and by whom he is sometimes
defeated. The Indra of mythology is
famous for his incontinence and adultery,
one prominent instance of which is his
seduction of Ahalyā, the wife of Gautama
(see Ahalyā), and for which he is often
spoken of as Ahalyā-jāra. The curse
of the sage impressed upon him a
1000 marks resembling the female
organ, and he was therefore called
Sayoni; but these marks were <lbinfo n="after+wards"/>
afterwards changed into eyes, and he is
hence called Netra-yoni and Sahasrākṣa.
In the Rāmāyaṇa Indra is <lbinfo n="represent+ed"/>
represented as having been defeated and carried
off to Laṅkā by Rāvaṇa's son called
Meghanāda, who for this exploit <lbinfo n="receiv+ed"/>
received the title of ‘Indrajit.’ It was only
at the intercession of Brahmā and the
gods that Indra was released, and this
humiliation was regarded as a <lbinfo n="punish+ment"/>
punishment for his seduction of Ahalyā. He
is also represented as being in constant
dread of sages practising potent <lbinfo n="pen+ances"/>
penances, and as sending down nymphs to
beguile their minds (see. {%Apsaras%}). In
the Purāṇas he is said to have destroyed
the offspring of Diti in her womb, and
to have cut off the wings of mountains
when they grew troublesome. Other
stories are also told in which Indra was
once worsted by Raja, grandson of
Purūravas, owing to the curse of <lbinfo n="Durvā+sas"/>
Durvāsas, and other accounts show that he and
Kṛṣṇa were at war with each other for
the Pārijāta tree which the latter
wanted to remove from Svarga, and
which he succeeded in doing in spite
of Indra's resistance. His wife is
Indr{%ani%}, the daughter of the demon
Puloman, and his son is named Jayanta.
He is also said to be father of Arjuna.
His epithets are numerous; mostly <lbinfo n="de+scriptive"/>
descriptive of his achievements, {%<ab>e. g.</ab>%}

the magical power of becoming invisible
which he had obtained from Śiva, bound
Indra, and bore him off in triumph to

gave to Meghanāda the title of Indrajit,
‘conqueror of Indra’; but the victor
refused to release his prisoner unless
he were promised immortality. Brahmā

demand, but he strenuously persisted, and
