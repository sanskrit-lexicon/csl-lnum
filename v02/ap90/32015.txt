<>he must have flourished about the close of the
<>first and the beginning of the second century of
<>the Christian era. Tradition makes him brother of
<>king Vikrama, and if this Vikrama be accepted
<>as the same who defeated the Mlecchas in 544
<><ab>A. D.</ab>, we must suppose Bhartṛhari to have <lbinfo n="flourish+ed"/>
<>flourished in the latter half of the sixth century.
