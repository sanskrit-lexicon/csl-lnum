{@--5@} Not derivable by inference. {#--dDaH#}
A fallacious {%hetu%}; one of the
five principal divisions of  <lbinfo n="hetvA#BAsa"/>
{#hetvABAsa#} or fallacies. It is of three 
[Page0213-c+ 56]
kinds:--(1) {#ASrayAsidDa#} where the <lbinfo n="ex+istence"/>
existence of any such locality ({#ASraya#})
as that where the property is said
to reside, is not established; as  <lbinfo n="gaga#nAraviMdaM"/>
‘{#gaganAraviMdaM suraBi araviMdatvAt#}’; (2)  <lbinfo n="svarUpAsi#dDa"/>
{#svarUpAsidDa#} where the nature ({#svarUpa#}) alleged
does not really reside in the subject
({#pakza#}); as {#Sabdo guRaH cAkzuzatvAt#}; and (3)
{#vyApyatAsidDa#} where the alleged <lbinfo n="inva+riableness"/>
invariableness of concomitance is not
real (the {#sADyatva#} not residing in  <lbinfo n="sA#Dya"/>
{#sADya#}); as {#parvato vahnimAn kAMcanamayaDUmAt#}.
