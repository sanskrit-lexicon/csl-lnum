doctrine (or the follower of that doctrine)
on the import of words, as opposed 
[Page0131-a+ 57]
to {#anvitABiDAnavAda, --vAdin#}. The  <lbinfo n="anvitā+bhidhānavādins"/>
{%anvitābhidhānavādins%} (the Mīmāṃsakas,
the followers of Prabhākara)
hold that words only express a
meaning ({#aBiDAna#}) as parts of a <lbinfo n="sen+tence"/>
sentence and grammatically connected
with one another ({#anvita#}); that they,
in fact, only imply an action or
something connected with an
action; {%<ab>e. g.</ab>%} {#GawaM#} in {#GawaM Anaya#} means
not merely ‘jar’, but ‘jar’ as <lbinfo n="con+nected"/>
connected with the action of ‘bringing’
expressed by the verb. The  <lbinfo n="abhihi+tānvayavādins"/>
{%abhihitānvayavādins%} (the Naiyāyikas, or
the followers of Kumārila who
hold the same doctrine) on the
other hand hold that words by <lbinfo n="them+selves"/>
themselves can express their own <lbinfo n="in+dependent"/>
independent meanings which are <lbinfo n="after+wards"/>
afterwards combined into a sentence
expressing one connected idea; that,
in other words, it is the logical <lbinfo n="con+nection"/>
connection between the words of a <lbinfo n="sen+tence"/>
sentence, and not the sense of the
words themselves, that suggests the
import or purport of that sentence;
they thus believe in a {%tātparyārtha%}
as distinguished from {%vāchyārtha%};
