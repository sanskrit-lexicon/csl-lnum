{#varaMqaH#}¦ [{#vf-aMqac#}] {@1@} A multitude,
group. {@--2@} A pimple or eruption
on the face. {@--3@} A veranda. {@--4@} A
heap of grass. {@--5@} The string of a
fish-hook. {@--6@} pocket. (The word
{#varaMqalaMbuka#} in {#yadidAnImahaM varaMqalaMbuka iva#}
{#dUramutkzipya pAtitaH#} <ls>Mk. 1.</ls> is of
doubtful meaning; it seems to
mean ‘an over-hanging or <lbinfo n="project+ing"/>
projecting wall’, which, if raised high,
is sure to topple down; so in the
case of the Sūtradhāra whose <lbinfo n="ex+pectations"/>
expectations were raised very high only
to be cruelly disappointed).
