<>{#yobaBUva soMgirAH#} <ab>N.</ab> of a celebrated sage to
<>whom many hymns of the Ṛgveda
<>are ascribed. Etymologically Aṅgiras is
<>connected with the word Agni and is often
<>regarded as its synonym ({#Sivo Bava prajAByo#}
<>{#mAnuzIByastvamaMgiraH; aMgiroBiH fziBiH#} <lbinfo n="saMpAdita#tvAt"/>

<>According to Bhārata he was a son of Agni. When
<>Agni began to practise penance, Aṅgiras
<>himself became Agni and surpassed him
<>in power and lustre, seeing which Agni
<>came to the sage and said:  <lbinfo n="--nikzipA#myahamagnitvaM"/>
<>--{#nikzipAmyahamagnitvaM tvamagniH praTamo Bava . BavizyAmi#}
<>{#dvitIyohaM prAjApatyaka eva ca ..#} Aṅgiras said:
<>{#kuru puRyaM prajAsargaM BavAgnistimirApahaH . mAM ca#}
<>{#deva kuruzvAgne praTamaM putramaMjasA .. tacCrutvAMgiraso#}
<>{#vAkyaM jAtavedAstaTA'karot#}. He was one of
<>the 10 mind-born sons of Brahmā. His
<>wife was Śraddhā, daughter of Kardama
<>and bore him {3} sons, Bṛhaspati, <lbinfo n="Uta+thya"/>
<>Utathya and Saṃvarta, and {4} daughters
<>Kuhū, Sinīvālī, Rākā and Anumati.
<>The Matsya Purāṇa says that Aṅgiras
<>was one of the three sages produced
<>from the sacrifice of Varuṇa and that
<>he was adopted by Agni as his son and
<>acted for some time as his regent. <lbinfo n="An+other"/>
<>Another account, however, makes him
<>father of Agni. He was one of the
<>seven great sages and also one of the
<>10 Prajāpatis or progenitors of mankind.
<>In latter times Aṅgiras was one of the
<>inspired lawgivers, and also a writer on
<>Astronomy. As an astronomical <lbinfo n="perso+nification"/>
<>personification he is Bṛhaspati, regent of <lbinfo n="Ju+piter"/>
<>Jupiter or Jupiter itself. He is also <lbinfo n="re+garded"/>
<>regarded as the priest of the gods and
<>the lord of sacrifices. Besides Śraddhā
<>his wives were Smṛti, two daughters
<>of Maitreya, some daughters of Dakṣa,
<>Svadhā and Satī. He is also regarded
<>as a teacher of the Brahmavidyā. The
<>Vedic hymns are also said to be his
<>daughters. According to the Bhāgavata
<>Purāṇa, Aṅgiras begot sons possessing
<>Brāhmanical glory on the wife of <lbinfo n="Ra+thītara"/>
<>Rathītara, a Kṣatriya who was childless
<>and these persons were afterwards called
<>descendants of Aṅgiras. The principal <lbinfo n="au+thors"/>
<>authors of vedic hymns in the family of <lbinfo n="Angi+ras"/>
<>Angiras were 33. His family has three distinct
<>branches {#kevalAMgirasa, gOtamAMgirasa#} and  <lbinfo n="BAra#dvAjAMgirasa"/>
<>{#BAradvAjAMgirasa#}, each branch having a number of
<>subdivisions. --(<ab>pl.</ab>) {@1@} Descendants
<>of Aṅgiras, [Aṅgiras being father of
<>Agni they are considered as descendants
<>of Agni himself who is called the first
<>of the Aṅgirasas. Like Aṅgiras they
<>occur in hymns addressed to luminous
[Page0021-a+ 60]
<>objects, and at a later period they became
<>for the most part personifications of
<>light, of luminous bodies, of divisions of
<>time, celestial phenomena and fires <lbinfo n="adapt+ed"/>
<>adapted to peculiar occasions, as the full moon
<>and change of the moon, or to particular

<>Hymns of the Atharvaveda. {@--3@}
<>Priests, who, by using magical <lbinfo n="for+mulas"/>
