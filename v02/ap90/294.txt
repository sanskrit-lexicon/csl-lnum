{#yobaBUva soMgirAH#} <ab>N.</ab> of a celebrated sage to
whom many hymns of the Ṛgveda
are ascribed. Etymologically Aṅgiras is
connected with the word Agni and is often
regarded as its synonym ({#Sivo Bava prajAByo#}
{#mAnuzIByastvamaMgiraH; aMgiroBiH fziBiH#} <lbinfo n="saMpAdita#tvAt"/>
{#saMpAditatvAt aMgasOzWavAdvA aMgirA agnirUpaH#}). <lbinfo n="Accord+ing"/>
According to Bhārata he was a son of Agni. When
Agni began to practise penance, Aṅgiras
himself became Agni and surpassed him
in power and lustre, seeing which Agni
came to the sage and said:  <lbinfo n="--nikzipA#myahamagnitvaM"/>
--{#nikzipAmyahamagnitvaM tvamagniH praTamo Bava . BavizyAmi#}
{#dvitIyohaM prAjApatyaka eva ca ..#} Aṅgiras said:
{#kuru puRyaM prajAsargaM BavAgnistimirApahaH . mAM ca#}
{#deva kuruzvAgne praTamaM putramaMjasA .. tacCrutvAMgiraso#}
{#vAkyaM jAtavedAstaTA'karot#}. He was one of
the 10 mind-born sons of Brahmā. His
wife was Śraddhā, daughter of Kardama
and bore him {3} sons, Bṛhaspati, <lbinfo n="Uta+thya"/>
Utathya and Saṃvarta, and {4} daughters
Kuhū, Sinīvālī, Rākā and Anumati.
The Matsya Purāṇa says that Aṅgiras
was one of the three sages produced
from the sacrifice of Varuṇa and that
he was adopted by Agni as his son and
acted for some time as his regent. <lbinfo n="An+other"/>
Another account, however, makes him
father of Agni. He was one of the
seven great sages and also one of the
10 Prajāpatis or progenitors of mankind.
In latter times Aṅgiras was one of the
inspired lawgivers, and also a writer on
Astronomy. As an astronomical <lbinfo n="perso+nification"/>
personification he is Bṛhaspati, regent of <lbinfo n="Ju+piter"/>
Jupiter or Jupiter itself. He is also <lbinfo n="re+garded"/>
regarded as the priest of the gods and
the lord of sacrifices. Besides Śraddhā
his wives were Smṛti, two daughters
of Maitreya, some daughters of Dakṣa,
Svadhā and Satī. He is also regarded
as a teacher of the Brahmavidyā. The
Vedic hymns are also said to be his
daughters. According to the Bhāgavata
Purāṇa, Aṅgiras begot sons possessing
Brāhmanical glory on the wife of <lbinfo n="Ra+thītara"/>
Rathītara, a Kṣatriya who was childless
and these persons were afterwards called
descendants of Aṅgiras. The principal <lbinfo n="au+thors"/>
authors of vedic hymns in the family of <lbinfo n="Angi+ras"/>
Angiras were 33. His family has three distinct
branches {#kevalAMgirasa, gOtamAMgirasa#} and  <lbinfo n="BAra#dvAjAMgirasa"/>
{#BAradvAjAMgirasa#}, each branch having a number of
subdivisions. --(<ab>pl.</ab>) {@1@} Descendants
of Aṅgiras, [Aṅgiras being father of
Agni they are considered as descendants
of Agni himself who is called the first
of the Aṅgirasas. Like Aṅgiras they
occur in hymns addressed to luminous
[Page0021-a+ 60]
objects, and at a later period they became
for the most part personifications of
light, of luminous bodies, of divisions of
time, celestial phenomena and fires <lbinfo n="adapt+ed"/>
adapted to peculiar occasions, as the full moon
and change of the moon, or to particular
rites, as the {#aSvameDa, rAjasUya#} &c.] {@--2@}
Hymns of the Atharvaveda. {@--3@}
Priests, who, by using magical <lbinfo n="for+mulas"/>
formulas of the Atharvaveda, protect
the sacrifice against the effects of
inauspicious accidents.
