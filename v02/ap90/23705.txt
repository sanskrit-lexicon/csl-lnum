<>{#raTagatiryasya#} <ls>Tv.</ls>] <ab>N.</ab> of a celebrated
<>king of the lunar race, son of <lbinfo n="Na+husha"/>
<>Nahusha; {#yayAtariva SarmizWA BarturbahumatA Bava#}
<><ls>Ś. 4. 6.</ls> [He married Devayānī,
<>daughter of Śukra, and Śarmiṣṭhā,
<>daughter of the king of Asuras, was
<>told by her father to be her servant as
<>a sort of recompense for her insulting
<>conduct towards her on a previous <lbinfo n="oc+casion"/>
<>occasion; (see Devayānī.) But Yayāti
<>fell in love with this servant and <lbinfo n="pri+vately"/>
<>privately married her. Aggrieved at this
<>Devayānī went to her father and <lbinfo n="com+plained"/>
<>complained of the conduct of her husband,
<>on whom, therefore, Śukra inflicted
<>premature infirmity and old age. Yayāti,
<>however, propitiated him and obtained
<>from him permission to transfer his
<>decrepitude to any one who would <lbinfo n="con+sent"/>
<>consent to take it. He asked his five sons,
<>but all refused except Puru, the <lbinfo n="young+est"/>
<>youngest. Yayāti accordingly transferred
<>his infirmity to Puru, and being once
<>more in the prime of youth, passed his
<>time in the enjoyment of sensual <lbinfo n="pleas+ures"/>
<>pleasures. This he did for 1000 years, and
<>yet his desire was not satisfied. At
<>last, however, with a vigorous effort he
<>renounced his sensual life, restored his
<>youth to Puru, and, having made him
<>successor to the throne, repaired to the
<>woods to lead a pious life and meditate
<>upon the Supreme Spirit].
