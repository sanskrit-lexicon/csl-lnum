particle {#naY#}, and changed to {#an#} before
vowels except in the word {#a-fRin#}.
The senses of {#na#} usually <lbinfo n="enumerat+ed"/>
enumerated are six- ({%a%}) {#sAdfSya#} ‘likeness’ or
‘resemblance’; {#abrAhmaRaH#} one like a
Brāhmaṇa (wearing the sacred thread

together in the following verse:
--{#tatsAdfSyamaBAvaSca tadanyatvaM tadalpatA .#} <lbinfo n="aprA#SastyaM"/>
{#aprASastyaM viroDaSca naYarTAH zaw prakIrtitAH ..#} See

as gerunds, infinitives, participles, it
has usually the sense of ‘not’; {#adagDvA#}
not having burnt: {#apaSyan#} not seeing;
so {#asakft#} not once; {#amfzA, akasmAt#}
&c. Sometimes {#a#} does not affect the
sense of the second member; {#a-paScima#}

prefixed to the root in the formation of
the Imperfect, Aorist and <lbinfo n="Condi+tional"/>
Conditional Tenses.
<P>{%N-B%}. --The application of this <lbinfo n="priva+tive"/>
privative prefix is practically unlimited; to
give every possible case would almost
amount to a dictionary itself. No <lbinfo n="at+tempt"/>
attempt will, therefore, be made to give
{%every possible%} combination of this prefix
with a following word; only such words
as require a special explanation, or such
as most frequently occur in the <lbinfo n="liter+ature"/>
literature and enter into compounds, with
other words, will be given; others will
be found self-explaining when the English
‘in,’ ‘un,’ or ‘not,’ is substituted for {#a#}
or {#an#} before the meaning of the second
word, or the sense may be expressed by
‘less,’ ‘free from,’ ‘devoid or destitute
of’ &c; {#akaTya#} unspeakable; {#adarpa#} <lbinfo n="with+out"/>
without pride, or freedom from pride;  <lbinfo n="apraga#lBa"/>
{#apragalBa#} not bold; {#aBaga#} unfortunate; {#avitta#} 
[Page0001-c+ 42]
destitute of wealth &c. &c. In many
cases such compounds will be found <lbinfo n="ex+plained"/>
explained under the second member. Most
compounds beginning with {#a#} or {#an#} are
either Tatpuruṣa or Bahuvrīhi (to be
determined by the sense) and should be
so dissolved.
