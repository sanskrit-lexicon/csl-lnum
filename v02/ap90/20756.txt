{#praveSakaH#}¦ ‘The introducer,’ an <lbinfo n="in+terlude"/>
interlude acted by inferior characters
(such as servants, buffoon &c.)
for the purpose of acquainting the
audience with events not <lbinfo n="represent+ed"/>
represented on the stage, but a knowledge
of which is essential for the proper
understanding of what follows;
(like the Viṣkambhaka it <lbinfo n="con+nects"/>
connects the story of the drama and
the subdivisions of the plot, by
briefly referring to what has <lbinfo n="oc+curred"/>
occurred in the intervals of the acts,
or what is likely to happen at the
end; it never occurs at the beginning
of the first act or at the end of the
last). <ls>S. D.</ls> thus defines it: --{#praveSako'#} <lbinfo n="nudA#ttoktyA"/>
