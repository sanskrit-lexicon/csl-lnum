<>a celebrated warrior on the side
<>of the Kauravas mentioned in
<>the Mahābhārata. [He was the son
<>of Kuntī begotten on her by the god
<>Sun while she was yet a virgin residing
<>at her father's house (see Kuntī). When
<>the child was born, Kuntī, afraid of the
<>censure of her relatives and also of <lbinfo n="pub+lic"/>
<>public scandal, threw the boy into the river
<>where he was found by Adhiratha,
<>charioteer of Dhṛtarāṣṭra and given
<>over to his wife Rādhā who brought him
<>up like her own child; whence Karṇa is
<>often called {%Sūtaputra%}, {%Rādheya%} &c.
<>Karṇa, when grown up, was made king
<>of Aṅga by Duryodhana, and became by
<>virtue of his many generous acts a type
<>of charity. On one occasion Indra
<>(whose care it was to favour his son
<>Arjuna) disguised himself as a <lbinfo n="Brāhma+ṇa"/>
<>Brāhmaṇa and cajoled him out of his divine
<>armour and ear-rings, and gave him in <lbinfo n="re+turn"/>
<>return a charmed javelin. With a desire to
<>make himself proficient in the science of
<>war, he, calling himself a Brāhmaṇa
<>went to Paraśurāma and learnt that
<>art from him. But his secret did not
<>long remain concealed. On one occasion
<>when Paraśurāma had fallen asleep with
<>his head resting on Karṇa's lap, a worm
<>(supposed by some to be the form <lbinfo n="assum+ed"/>
<>assumed by Indra himself to defeat Karṇa's
<>object) began to eat into his lap and
<>made a deep rent in it; but as Karṇa
<>showed not the least sign of pain, his
<>real character was discovered by his
<>preceptor who cursed him that the art
<>he had learnt would avail him not in
<>times of need. On another occasion
<>he was cursed by a Brāhmaṇa (whose
<>cow he had unwittingly slain in chase)
<>that the earth would eat up the wheel
<>of his chariot in the hour of trial. Even
<>with such disadvantages as these, he <lbinfo n="ac+quitted"/>
<>acquitted himself most valiantly in the
<>great war between the Pāṇḍavas and
<>Kauravas, while acting as generalissimo
<>of the Kaurava forces after Bhīṣma
<>and Droṇa had fallen. He maintained 
[Page0382-b+ 58]
<>the field against the Pāṇḍavas for three
<>days, but on the last day he was slain by
<>Arjuna while the wheel of his chariot
<>had sunk down into the earth. Karṇa
<>was the most intimate friend of <lbinfo n="Duryo+dhana"/>
<>Duryodhana, and with Śakuni joined him in all
<>the various schemes and plots that
<>were devised from time to time
