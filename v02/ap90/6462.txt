(<ab>pl.</ab>) ‘Propitiatory verses’, a name
given to certain invocations <lbinfo n="addres+sed"/>
addressed to several deified objects in <lbinfo n="con+secutive"/>
consecutive order, and said to be <lbinfo n="in+troductory"/>
introductory to the animal sacrifice;
some take the {%Āprīs%} to represent
the objects themselves, the verses
being consequently called {%Āprī%}
verses. The objects invoked are
12:--Susamiddha, Tanūnapāt,
Narāśaṃsa, the divine being bearing
invocations to the gods, Barhis, the
doors of the sacrificial chamber, night
and dawn, the two divine beings
protecting the sacrifice, the three
goddesses Ilā, Sarasvatī, and Mahī,
Tvaṣṭṛ, Vanaspati and Svāhā,
(all these being regarded by Sāyaṇa
to be different forms of Agni);
