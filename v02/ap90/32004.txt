{#kAlidAsa#}¦ The celebrated author of the {#aBijYAnaSakuMtala#},
{#vikramorvaSIya, mAlavikAgnimitra, raGuvaMSa, kumArasaMBava, meGadUta#}, <lbinfo n="ftu#saMhAra"/>
{#ftusaMhAra#}; also of the poems {#nalodaya#} and of some other
minor works. The earliest known authentic <lbinfo n="refer+ence"/>
reference to Kālidāsa is in an inscription dated 556
Śake or 634 <ab>A. D.</ab>, in which he and Bhāravi
are spoken of as being renowned poets. The verse
is as follows:--
{#yenAyoji na veSma#}
{#sTiramarTaviDO vivekinA jinaveSma .#}
{#sa vijayatAM ravikIrtiH#}
{#kavitASritakAlidAsaBAravikIrtiH ..#}
<P>Bāṇa's reference to him in the beginning of his
Harṣa-charita also shows that he must have <lbinfo n="flou+rished"/>
flourished before the time of Bāṇa, {%<ab>i. e.</ab>%} before the
first half of the seventh century. But how long
before the seventh century the poet flourished
is not yet known. According to Mallinātha's <lbinfo n="ex+planation"/>
explanation on <ls>Me. 14</ls> {#nicula#} and {#diNnAga#} were <lbinfo n="con+temporaries"/>
contemporaries of Kālidāsa. If Mallinātha's <lbinfo n="sug+gestion"/>
suggestion be correct-and it is very doubtful if it be
really so-then our poet must have lived in the
middle of the sixth century which is the date
usually assigned to {#diNnAga#}.
<P>There is one point which, if definitely settled,
would give the poet's precise date. It is the
mention by Kālidāsa of his patron Vikrama.
Who this Vikrama is it has not yet been <lbinfo n="definite+ly"/>
definitely settled. Popular tradition identifies him with
the founder of the Saṃvat Era which is said to
have commenced 56 <ab>B. C.</ab> If this view be <lbinfo n="cor+rect"/>
correct, Kālidāsa must be considered as belonging
to the first century before Christ. But some
scholars have recently come to the conclusion
that what is called the era of Vikramāditya
56. <ab>B. C.</ab> was a date arrived at by taking the date 
[Page1191-b+ 48]
of the great battle of Korūr in which Vikrama
finally defeated the Mlecchas, {%<ab>i. e.</ab>%} 544 <ab>A. D.</ab>
and then by throwing back the beginning of the
new era 600 years before that date, {%<ab>i. e.</ab>%} 56 B.
C. If this conclusion be accepted as correct-and
scholars do not seem to have yet agreed on the
point-Kālidāsa must have flourished in the sixth
century <ab>A. D.</ab> The question is still an open one.
