(Śvetaki could not get any priests to assist him in his
sacrifice; he then applied to Śiva, who caused Durvāsas to
complete the sacrifice on the condition that {%Ś%}. poured libations
of clarified butter into the fire for twelve years; from this
Agni (fire) became sick; after the completion of the sacrifice
{%Ś%}. ascended to heaven (only B.)). Cf. Śvetaketu<sup>2</sup>.
