(Bhṛgu-Bharadvājasaṃv.): XII, {@184@}, 6844 ({%°āt praṇīyate%}
{%prāṇī%}), {@189@}, 6965.—§ 660{%c%} (do.): The wind or breath
called {%Prāṇa%} residing within the head, and the heat that is
there, cause all kinds of exertion. That {%Prāṇa%} is the living
creature, the universal soul, the eternal Being, and the
Mind, Intellect, and Consciousness of all living creatures,
etc. Thus the living being is, in every respect, caused by
{%Prāṇa%} to move about and exert…That heat, residing
between {%Apāna%} and {%Prāṇa%}, in the region of the navel,
operates, with the aid of those two breaths, in digesting all
food that is taken by a living creature. There is a duct
beginning from the mouth down to the anal canal. Its
extremity is called the anus. From this main duct ({%srotas%})
numerous subsidiary ones branch out in the bodies of all
living creatures. In consequence of the rush of the several
breaths ({%Prāṇa, Samāna%}, etc.) those breaths mingle together.
The heat ({%agniḥ%}) [that dwells in {%Prāṇa%}, PCR.] is called
{%Ūṣman%}. It is this heat that causes digestion…The
breath called {%Prāṇa%}, the bearer of a current of heat, descends
[from the head, PCR.] downwards to the extremity of the
anal canal and thence is pushed upwards again. Coming
back to its seat in the head it once more sends back the heat
it bears. Below the navel is the region of digested matter,
and above it that for the food not yet digested. The navel is
the depositary of all the forces of life, which sustain the body.
Urged by the ten kinds of breaths the ducts ({%nāḍyaḥ%}),
branching out from the heart, convey the liquid juices that
food yields upwards, downwards, and in transverse directions.
The main duct leading from the mouth to the anus is the
path by which {%yogins%} succeed in attaining to {%Bráhman%} by
holding the soul within the brain. Even thus heat is planted
in the breaths called {%Prāṇa%} and {%Apāna%} of all embodied
creatures. That heat is always burning there like fire
in any vessel: XII, {@185@}, 6868, 6870, 6878, 6882.—§ 662{%b%}
