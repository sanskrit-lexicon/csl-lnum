{@Arjunābhigamanaparvan@}.¦ § 317: Hearing that the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} had been banished, the {%Bhojas, Vṛṣṇis, Andhakas%},
the heirs of {%Pañcāla%}, the {%Cedi%} king {%Dhṛṣṭaketu%}, the brothers
{%Kaikeya%} went to see them. As {%Kṛṣṇa (b%}) said: “the earth
shall drink the blood of {%Duryodhana%}, etc.,” {%Arjuna%} tried to
pacify him by reciting the feats achieved in his former lives
({%b%}); then {%Arjuna%}, the soul of {%Kṛṣṇa%}, became silent, and
{%Janārdana%} (i.e. Kṛṣṇa) ({%b%}) replied that he was identical
with {%Arjuna%}. Then {%Pāñcālī%} (i.e. Kṛṣṇā), surrounded by
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} and her other brothers, praised {%Kṛṣṇa (b%}).
She then blamed him and the {%Pāṇḍavas%} for having let her
endure the shame of being dragged in the assembly, etc.

(“fie on that {%Gāṇḍīva (c%})”), and relates the persecutions of
{%Duryodhana%} (cf. § 197) and the valour of {%Bhīma%} until the
{%svayaṃvara. Kṛṣṇa%} promised that she should be avenged,
and {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} said: “I will slay {%Droṇa; Śikhaṇḍin%}
{%Pitāmaha%} (i.e. Bhīṣma); {%Bhīmasena Duryodhana%}; and
{%Dhanañjaya%} (i.e. Arjuna) {%Karṇa%}; assisted by {%Rāma%} and
{%Kṛṣṇa%} we are invincible in battle even to {%Indra%}” (III, {@12@}).
—§ 318: {%Kṛṣṇa%} said that if he had not been absent from
{%Dvārakā%} (v. 610: the {%Anartta%} country) at that time, he should
have come and prevented the gambling by either persuading
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} (relating how the son of {%Vīrasena%} was formerly
deprived of his kingdom, etc.), or compelling him by force;
on arriving at {%Dvārakā%} he had learnt from {%Yuyudhāna%} what
had happened and had instantly come to see them (III, {@13@}).
