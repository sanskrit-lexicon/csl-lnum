[{@Bhagavadgītāparvan(°va)@}]¦ (“the section including
the song of the Exalted one,” the 69th of the minor parvans
of Mhbhr.; cf. Bhagavadgītā). § 576: {%Sañjaya%} informs
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} of {%Bhīṣma's%} fall in battle (VI, {@13@}). {%Dhṛta-%}
{%rāṣṭra's%} lament and inquiries (VI, {@14@}). {%Sañjaya%}, praising
{%Vyāsa%} for his {%yoga%}-power, i.e. the celestial vision (description)
he had given him, began his discourse on the battle.
{%Duryodhana%} gave {%Duḥśāsana%} instructions about the protection
of {%Bhīṣma%} from {%Śikhaṇḍin%} (VI, {@15@}). The two hosts arrayed
at sunrise (description). {%Śakuni%}, etc. (α), stood each at the
head of an {%akṣauhiṇī%}; the 11th under {%Bhīṣma%} (description)
stood in advance of the whole army. The {%Sṛñjayas%}, headed
by {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, looked [beholding {%Bhīṣma%}] like small
animals beholding a lion (VI, {@16@}). On that day {%Soma%}
approached the region of the {%Pitṛs%}. Omens. Every morning
{%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa%} prayed for victory for the {%Pāṇḍavas%},
though they must fight for {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} according to their
pledge: {%Bhīṣma%} briefly addressed the {%Kuru%} army, mentioning
{%Nābhaga%}, etc. (β), as examples. {%Karṇa%}, with his friends
and relatives, laid aside his weapons owing to {%Bhīṣma%}.
Description of the proceedings of the army, especially of
{%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (γ) (VI, {@17@}). {%Duḥśāsana%}, etc. (δ), protected
{%Bhīṣma%} from behind, etc. (VI, {@18@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} told
{%Arjuna%}, according to the words of the M.-ṛ. {%Bṛhaspati%}, to array
the troops in needle-mouthed ({%śucīmukha%}) array. {%Arjuna%} said
that he would make a {%Vajra%} array, which was designed by
{%Indra%}; they would all seek shelter with {%Bhīma%}. The leaders
were {%Bhīmasena%}, etc. (ε). Omens (VI, {@19@}). When the sun
rose the {%Kauravas%} stood facing the west, the {%Pāṇḍavas%} facing
the east. Disposition of the two armies: {%Duryodhana%}, etc. (ζ)
(VI, {@20@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} sorrowfully addressed {%Arjuna%}, who
consoled him with his truth, righteousness, etc., which {%Nārada%},
{%Bhīṣma%}, and {%Droṇa%} knew, and which were a powerful aid
towards victory according to {%Bráhman's%} words to {%Indra%},
etc., on the occasion of the battle between the gods and
the {%Asuras%}; “victory clings to Kṛṣṇa”; it was by
choosing him that the gods under {%Indra%} had vanquished the
{%Asuras%} (VI, {@21@}). Disposition of the troops in the {%Pāṇḍava%}
army: {%Śikhaṇḍin%}, etc. (η) (VI, {@22@}). At {%Kṛṣṇa's%} instance
{%Arjuna%} recited a hymn to {%Durgā. Durgā%} appeared and gave
him assurances of victory. Merits of this hymn (VI, {@23@}).
The combatants of both armies were cheerful, etc. (VI, {@24@}).
Before {%Droṇa, Duryodhana%} compared the combatants of the
{%Pāṇḍava%} army: {%Bhīma%}, etc. (θ), with his own; {%Droṇa%},
[Page114-b+ 63]
etc. (ι). {%Kṛṣṇa%}, etc., blew {%Pāñcajanya%}, etc. (κ). {%Arjuna%}
asked {%Kṛṣṇa%} to place his chariot between the two armies, so
that he might see who were assembled to fight. Beholding his
relatives, etc., {%Arjuna%} was filled with compassion and overcome
with despondency, and refused to fight (VI, {@25@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%}
appealed to {%Arjuna%} to shake off his despondency, but in
vain. {%Kṛṣṇa%} then declared to {%Arjuna%} the nature and the
attributes of the soul, and the folly of grieving for the dead,
and exhorted him to comply with the duties of his order by
fighting fairly, and to apply himself to work for work's
sake, and not for the sake of its results. {%Kṛṣṇa%} spoke of
contemplation (VI, {@26@}); on the {%Sāṅkhyas%} and {%Yogins%}; on
devotion to work (VI, {@27@}); on his reiterated births; on the
best way (VI, {@28@}); on abandonment of actions and application
to actions; he has the right view who considers {%Sāṅkhya%}
and {%Yoga%} as one (VI, {@29@}); on the means of rising to
devotion (VI, {@30@}); on {%Kṛṣṇa%} identified with {%Bráhman%}
(VI, {@31@}); on the nature of Bráhman (VI, {@32@}); on {%Kṛṣṇa%}
as the pervader of the whole universe, and as the enjoyer of
all sacrifice (VI, {@33@}); on {%Kṛṣṇa%} as the source of the gods,
etc. {%Arjuna%} believed what {%Kṛṣṇa%} said, and what also had
been said by all the Ṛ., and the D.-ṛ. {%Nārada%}, and {%Asita%}
{%Devala%} and {%Vyāsa. Kṛṣṇa%} declared his divine perfections
to {%Arjuna%} (VI, {@34@}), and disclosed his supreme sovereign
form; he was praised by {%Arjuna%} (VI, {@35@}); he discoursed on
the two kinds of worshippers (VI, {@36@}); on the body and
the soul, etc., the supreme object of knowledge (VI, {@37@});
on the three {%guṇas%} (Goodness, Passion, and Darkness) (VI,
{@38@}); on the symbolical {%Aśvattha%} (VI, {@39@}); on godlike and
demoniac natures and births (VI, {@40@}); on the threefold
nature of faith (VI, {@41@}); on renunciation and abandonment.
—{%Arjuna's%} delusion is destroyed, and he once more takes
up the {%Gāṇḍīva%} (VI, {@42@}).
