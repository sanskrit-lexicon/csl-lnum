[{@Vītahavyopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode relating to
Vītahavya”). § 736{%b%} (Ānuśāsanik.). {%Bhīṣma%} said: While
{%Manu%}, in days of yore, was righteously ruling his subjects, he
obtained a righteous son {%Śaryāti%}, in whose race were born
{%Vatsa's%} sons, the kings {%Haihaya%} and {%Tālajaṅgha. Haihaya%}
(or {%Vītahavya%}) had 10 wives and 100 heroic sons, who all
studied the {%Vedas%} and {%Dhanurveda%}. In {%Kāśi%} was king
{%Haryaśva%}, the grandfather of {%Divodāsa%}. The sons of king
{%Haihaya (Vītahavya-dāyādaiḥ%}) invaded {%Kāśi%} and slew king
{%Haryaśva%} in a battle between the {%Gaṅgā%} and the {%Yamunā%},
and then went back to their own delightful city in the {%Vatsa%}-
country. Meanwhile {%Haryaśva's%} son {%Sudeva%} was installed as
{%Kāśi%}-king. The 100 sons of {%Vītahavya%} once more came and
defeated him in battle, and then returned to their own city.
After this, {%Sudeva's%} son {%Divodāsa%} became installed as {%Kāśi%}-
king; at the command of {%Indra%} he built the city of {%Vārāṇasī%}
between the {%Gaṅgā%} and the southern bank of the {%Gomatī%}.
The {%Haihayas%} again attacked {%Divodāsa%}; he fought for 1,000
days, lost his army, left his capital, and fled away to the
retreat of {%Bharadvāja%}, who was his priest, and performed a
sacrifice, in consequence of which {%Pratardana%} was born to
him. On the same day when {%Pratardana%} was born, he grew
as great as a boy of 13 years, and mastered the {%Vedas%} and
{%Dhanurveda, Bharadvāja%} (aided by {%Yoga%}) having entered into
the prince and caused all the energy of the universe to enter
his body (he was praised by bards and D-ṛ., etc.; description).
{%Divodāsa%} installed {%Pratardana%} as {%yuvarāja%} and ordered him
to march against the sons of {%Vītahavya. Pratardana%} speedily
crossed the {%Gaṅgā%} and proceeded against the city of the
{%Vītahavyas%} and slew them all. King {%Vītahavya%} fled away to
the retreat of {%Bhṛgu. Pratardana%} followed in his footsteps
and ordered {%Bhṛgu%} to surrender king {%Vītahavya. Bhṛgu%}
said: “there is no {%kṣatriya%} in this retreat; they who
are here are all brahmans.” {%Pratardana%} returned home,
and {%Vītahavya%} became a Br-ṛ. in consequence of {%Bhṛgu's%}
statement. {%Vītahavya > Gṛtsamada%} (V-ṛ., resembling {%Indra%}
and, therefore, once afflicted by Dai.; alleged quotation from
the {%Ṛgveda%}) {%> Sutejas > Varcas > Vihavya > Vitatya > Satya >%}

upon Aps. {%Ghṛtācī%}) {%> Śunaka%} (begotten upon {%Pramadvarā%}) {%>%}
{%Śaunaka%} (XIII, {@30@}).
