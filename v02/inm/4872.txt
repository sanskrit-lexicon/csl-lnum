{@[Jayadrathavadhaparvan]@}¦ (“the section including the
slaughter of Jayadratha,” the 75th of the minor parvans
of Mhbhr.; cf. Jayadrathavadha). § 598: {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
lamented the slaughter of his troops; “formerly in the abode
of {%Somadatta%}, who was devoted to truth, I used to hear
delightful sounds” (instead of grief and lamentations, as now in
the houses of {%Viviṃśati%}, etc. (α)); then he mentioned {%Kṛṣṇa's%}
ambassadorship, the match at dice, that he and {%Vidura%}, etc. (β)
did not approve of; “possessed of sovereignty, the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
will ever listen to the voice of {%Śalya%}, etc.” (γ); “none can
fight {%Bhīmasena%}, etc. (δ); only {%Duryodhana%}, etc. (ε), would
venture to resist them”; he asked what the principal leaders
(ζ) did (VII, {@85@}). {%Sañjaya%} rebuked {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} for his
folly in bringing about the battle (VII, {@86@}). {%Droṇa%} arrayed
his divisions. The warriors shouted in anger “where is
Arjuna?” etc. (η). {%Droṇa%} assured {%Jayadratha%} of protection.
by {%Somadatta's%} son, etc. (θ). {%Droṇa's%} array was in part
a {%śakaṭa%} and in part a circle, 48 miles long, and the width
of its rear was 20 miles; in the rear was another impenetrable
array in the form of a lotus; and within that a needle, in the
mouth of the needle was {%Kṛtavarman%}; next came the {%Kāmboja%}
king, etc. (ι); behind them all was {%Jayadratha%} at one side of
the needle. At the head of the {%śakaṭa%} was {%Droṇa (b%}). Si.
and Cā. wondered. {%Duryodhana%} rejoiced (VII, {@87@}). After
the {%Rudra%}-hour ({%Raudre muhūrte%}) had set in {%Arjuna%} made
his appearance, while portents appeared in nature. Then
{%Nakula's%} son {%Śatānīka%} and {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} arrayed the
divisions of the {%Pāṇḍavas. Durmarṣaṇa%} (Dhārtarāṣṭra)
took up his position in the van in order to oppose {%Arjuna%};
{%Arjuna%} was at the very van of his army. {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%}
blew their conches. The {%Kuru%} army was afraid (VII, {@88@}).—
§ 599: THE FOURTEENTH DAY'S BATTLR. {%Arjuna & Durmarṣaṇa%};
a terrible carnage was caused by {%Arjuna; Durmarṣaṇa's%}
division fled away (VII, {@89@}). {%Duḥśāsana & Arjuna; Duḥśā-%}
{%sana's%} division was slaughtered and routed; he sought protection
with {%Droṇa%} (VII, {@90@}). {%Arjuna%} met with {%Droṇa%} and prayed
for leave to slay {%Jayadratha; Droṇa%} refused leave and attacked
{%Arjuna%}; unable to vanquish {%Droṇa, Arjuna%} avoided him from
fear of losing time, and penetrated into the {%Kuru%} army, the
{%Pāñcāla%} princes, {%Yudhāmanyu%} and {%Uttamaujas%}, being the
protectors of his wheels; {%Jaya%}, etc. (α), opposed {%Arjuna%},-and
so did the {%Abhīṣāhas%}, etc. (β), with {%Droṇa%} at their head
(VII, {@91@}). {%Droṇa & Arjuna%}, who employed the {%Brāhma%}
weapon. {%Arjuna%} avoided {%Droṇa%}, began to slaughter the {%Bhojas%},
and took up his position between {%Kṛtavarman%} and the {%Kāmboja%}
king {%Sudakṣiṇa. Arjuna & Kṛtavarman%}, who was stupefied;
{%Arjuna%} proceeded to the division of the {%Kāmbojas. Kṛta-%}
{%varman & Yudhāmanyu + Uttamaujas%}, who were prevented by
[Page359-b+ 63]
{%Kṛtavarman%} from following {%Arjuna%}, who did not slay {%Kṛta-%}
{%varman. Śrutāyudha (b) & Arjuna (+ Kṛṣṇa); Śrutāyudha%}
attacked {%Kṛṣṇa%} with his mace, which returned and slew
{%Śrutāyudha%} himself; all the troops fled away. The {%Kāmboja%}
king {%Sudakṣiṇa & Arjuna%}, who slew him; all the troops fled
away (VII, {@92@}). {%Arjuna%} slew the {%Abhīṣāhas%}, etc. (γ).
{%Śrutāyus + Acyutāyus & Arjuna%}, who slew them both with
the {%Aindra%} weapon. {%Niyatāyus + Dīrghāyus%} (the sons of
{%Śrutāyus%} and {%Acyutāyus%}) & {%Arjuna%}, who slew them both.
The {%Aṅgas%} (on elephants) + the {%Kaliṅga%} king, etc. (on
elephants; urged by {%Duryodhana%}), & {%Arjuna%}, who caused
a great carnage among them, as also among the {%Mlecchas%},
{%Yavanas%}, etc. (δ). The {%Ambastha%} king {%Śrutāyus & Arjuna%}
({%+ Kṛṣṇa%}), who slew him (VII, {@93@}). {%Duryodhana%} addressed
{%Droṇa%} in wrath and affection. {%Droṇa%} acknowledged his
inability to oppose {%Arjuna%} on account of his own old age.
{%Droṇa%} cased {%Duryodhana%} in invulnerable armour (invoking
the {%Vedas, Nahuṣa%}, etc. (ε)) and urged him to oppose {%Arjuna%};
with this armour he need have no fear from As., D., Y., U.,
Rā., men, etc. It was the armour that {%Śiva%} had given to
{%Indra%}, by means of which he slew {%Vṛtra (c); Indra >%}
{%Aṅgiras > Bṛhaspati > Agniveśya > Droṇa%}. It was put on,
its pieces being joined with {%Brāhma%} strings. {%Brahmán%} had
himself put it on {%Viṣṇu%} in days of yore, and on {%Indra%} in the
fight about {%Tārakā. Duryodhana + Trigartas%}, etc., proceeded
towards the chariot of {%Arjuna%} (VII, {@94@}). The {%Pāṇḍavas%}
(headed by {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}) + {%Somakas & Droṇa%}; a fierce battle
ensued in front of the {%Kuru%} array; {%Droṇa & Dhṛṣṭadyumna%};
{%Droṇa's%} host became divided into three bodies: one which
retreated towards {%Kṛtavarman%}, another towards {%Jalasandha%},
another towards {%Droṇa%} himself; {%Viviṃśati%}, etc. (ζ), {%& Bhīma-%}
{%sena%}; king {%Bāhlīka%} & the {%Draupadeyas%}; the {%Govāsana%} chief

{%Sauvīras%} and {%Prabhadrakas & Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Alāyudha &%}
{%Ghaṭotkaca; Kuntibhoja%} and Rā. {%Alambuṣa. Jayadratha%}
remained in the rear, protected by {%Kṛpa%}, etc., and the
protectors of his wheels were {%Aśvatthāman%} on the right and
{%Karṇa%} on the left; his rear was protected by {%Kṛpa%}, etc. (η),
headed by {%Somadatta's%} son (VII, {@95@}). {%Droṇa%}, in front of
his array, fought the {%Pārthas. Vinda%} and {%Anuvinda &%}
{%Virāṭa; Śikhaṇḍin & Bāhlīka%}; the {%Govāsana%} king {%Śaibya &%}
the {%Kāśi%} king; the {%Bāhlīka%} king & the {%Draupadeyas%};
{%Duḥśāsana & Sātyaki; Kuntibhoja & Alambuṣa; Nakula%} and
{%Sahadeva & Śakuni%}, who fled towards {%Droṇa%}; Rā. {%Ghaṭotkaca%}
& Rā. {%Alāyudha; Yudhiṣṭhira & Śalya; Viviṃśati%}, etc. (θ), &
{%Bhīmasena%} (VII, {@96@}). {%Bhīmasena & Jalasandha; Yudhiṣṭhira%}
{%& Kṛtavarman; Dhṛṣṭadyumna & Droṇa; Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}
mounted {%Droṇa's%} chariot, had his {%pārṣṇi%} charioteers slain,
etc., but was rescued by {%Sātyaki; Droṇa & Sātyaki%} (VII, {@97@}).
{%Sātyaki (Yuyudhāna) & Droṇa%}; D. (headed by {%Brahmán%} and
{%Soma%}), Si., Cā., Vd., M.-U. looked at; {%Droṇa%} acknowledged
in {%Sātyaki%} the force of {%Rāma%}, etc. (ι); D. (with {%Indra%}), G.,
Si., and Cā. admired him; {%Droṇa%} invoked the {%Āgneya%} weapon,
{%Sātyaki%} the {%Vāruṇa%} weapon. Just at that time the sun went
down in his course. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (κ) (in order to protect
{%Sātyaki%}), & {%Droṇa%} (protected by {%Duḥśāsana%}, etc.) (VII, {@98@}).
{%Arjuna%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} steadily proceeded towards {%Jayadratha%}
(description). {%Vinda%} and {%Anuvinda & Arjuna%}, who slew
them both. While {%Kṛṣṇa%} groomed {%Arjuna's%} steeds, {%Arjuna%}
on foot held the whole {%Kuru%} army in check, and piercing the
[Page360-a+ 63]
earth with a weapon made a lake for his steeds to drink from,
and an arrow hall for them to rest within; {%Nārada%} came to
see the lake (VII, {@99@}). The Si. and Cā., etc., applauded.
The {%Kurus%} fiercely attacked {%Arjuna%} while he was on foot;
{%Arjuna%} beat back all his assailants; the {%Kurus%} applauded his
prowess, blaming {%Duryodhana%}. After finishing the grooming
{%Kṛṣṇa%} reharnessed the steeds and proceeded with great speed.
{%Duryodhana%} followed (VII, {@100@}). The progress of {%Arjuna%}
(with {%Kṛṣṇa%}) became irresistible. {%Duryodhana%} outran {%Arjuna%}
in a single chariot, and then turned back, facing {%Kṛṣṇa%} (VII,
{@101@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} pointed out {%Duryodhana%} to {%Arjuna%} and urged
him to slay him (“the three worlds with D., As., and men
cannot vanquish thee, what need be said of {%Duryodhana?%}”),
mentioning {%Duryodhana's%} injuries (λ); {%Arjuna%} promised to
slay him; {%Arjuna & Duryodhana%} (VII, {@102@}). {%Arjuna%} failed
to pierce {%Duryodhana%} in consequence of the latter's invulnerable
armour; “the chief of the gods gave this invulnerable armour
to {%Aṅgiras > Bṛhaspati > Indra > Arjuna.” Arjuna%} shot strong
arrows, strengthened by {%mantras%}, at {%Duryodhana%}, which were
cut off by {%Aśvatthāman%}; this weapon could not be used again
lest it should slay {%Arjuna%} himself. {%Arjuna%} deprived {%Duryo-%}
{%dhana%} of his chariot, and steeds, and weapons; when {%Kṛṣṇa%}
blew {%Pāñcajanya%} and {%Arjuna%} drew {%Gāṇḍīva%}, the {%Kurus%} fell
down on the ground. The protectors of {%Jayadratha%} attacked
{%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%} (VII, {@103@}). {%Bhūriśravas%}, etc. (μ) (with
{%Saindhava%} horses, etc.), & {%Arjuna%}, who blew {%Devadatta%}, as
{%Kṛṣṇa%} blew {%Pāñcajanya; Duryodhana + Bhūriśravas%}, etc.
(μ), & {%Arjuna; Aśvatthāman & Arjuna (+ Kṛṣṇa%}) (VII,
{@104@}). {%Sañjaya%} described to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} the standards (ν).
{%Arjuna%}, assailed by many chariot-warriors, slew many of them
(VII, {@105@}). In the afternoon: The {%Pāñcālas%} and the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
(desirous of slaying {%Droṇa%}) & the {%Kurus; Bṛhatkṣattra%}
(among the {%Kaikayas%}) & {%Droṇa; Kṣemadhūrti & Bṛhatkṣattra%};
{%Dhṛṣṭaketu%} (the {%Cedi%}) & {%Kṣemadhūrti; Vīradhanvan &%}
{%Dhṛṣṭaketu; Yudhiṣṭhira & Droṇa; Vikarṇa%} (Dhārtarāṣṭra)
& {%Nakula; Durmukha & Sahadeva; Vyāghradatta & Sātyaki%};

displayed great heroism; both he and {%Droṇa%} invoked the
{%Brāhma%} weapon; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, in distress, getting upon the
chariot of {%Sahadeva%} is borne away from the field (VII, {@106@}).
{%Kṣemadhūrti%} & the {%Kaikaya%} prince {%Bṛhatkṣattra%}, who slew
{%Kṣemadhūrti; Vīradhanvan & Dhṛṣṭaketu%} (advancing against
{%Droṇa%}); Si. and Cā. wondered; {%Vīradhanvan%} was slain by
{%Dhṛṣṭaketu; Durmukha%} (Dhārtarāṣṭra) & {%Sahadeva; Dur-%}
{%mukha%} mounted the chariot of {%Niramitra%}, who was slain by
{%Sahadeva; Nakula & Vikarṇa%} (Dhārtarāṣṭra), whom he
vanquished; {%Vyāghradatta%} ({%Magadha%} prince) & {%Sātyaki%}, who
slew him; the {%Magadhas & Sātyaki%}, who nearly exterminated
them; the {%Kurus%} were routed; {%Droṇa & Sātyaki%} (VII, {@107@});
{%Bhūriśravas%} & the {%Draupadeyas; Śatānīka%} (the son of {%Nakula%}),

Rā. {%Alambuṣa%} (son of {%Ṛṣyaśṛṅga%}; recollecting the slaughter
of his brother {%Baka%}) & {%Bhīmasena; Alambuṣa%} resorted to
illusive tricks and caused a river of blood with Rā., etc.,
wafting away countless {%Cedis%}; etc. (ο); {%Bhīma%} employed the
{%Tvāṣṭra%} weapon; {%Alambuṣa%} fled to {%Droṇa%} (VII, {@108@}).
{%Ghaṭotkaca & Alambuṣa%}; both availed themselves of their
illusive power; the {%Pāṇḍavas%} ({%Bhīmasena%}, etc.) & {%Alambuṣa%};
{%Bhīmasena's%} son, etc. (π), & do., who was slain by {%Ghaṭotkaca%}
(VII, {@109@}). {%Yuyudhāna & Droṇa; Yudhiṣṭhira%} urged
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} and all his troops, headed by {%Bhīmasena%}, to
rescue {%Yuyudhāna; Yudhiṣṭhira%} (with all his troops) & {%Droṇa%},
[Page360-b+ 63]
who slew many and vanquished the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, etc. (ρ);
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} heard the sound of {%Pāñcajanya%} and thought
{%Arjuna%} to be in distress; he requested {%Sātyaki%} to go to
{%Arjuna%} and bring him news of his safety; {%Arjuna%} had said
in the {%Dvaitavana%} to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, “even if {%Kṛṣṇa%}, etc. (σ),
assist us, I shall yet appoint {%Sātyaki%} for our aid, since there
is none equal to him,” and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} had witnessed his
reverence for {%Arjuna%} at {%Dvārakā%} when returning from the
{%tīrthas%}, and at {%Upaplavya%} his affection for the {%Pāṇḍavas%};
“the day is about to end”; amongst the {%Vṛṣṇis%} two
were regarded as {%atirathas: Pradyumna%} and {%Sātyaki%} (in
weapons equal to {%Nārāyaṇa%}, in strength to {%Saṅkarṣaṇa%},
in bravery to {%Arjuna%}, surpassing {%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa%}) (VII,
{@110@}). {%Sātyaki%} hesitated to comply with {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%}
request on the ground of the counter-commands of {%Arjuna%}
(“only {%Pradyumna%} and {%Sātyaki%} are a match for {%Droṇa%} in
battle”); “the {%Sauvīrakas%}, etc. (τ), D., As., men, Rā., K.,
M.-U., etc., are no match for {%Arjuna%} in battle.” {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
pressed his request, saying that {%Bhīma%}, etc. (υ), will protect
him during {%Sātyaki's%} absence (VII, {@111@}). {%Sātyaki%} agreed to
obey {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}; “the distance from here is three {%yojanas%}”;
he would crush the elephants of the {%Añjana%} breed, mounted
by {%Mlecchas%} (named {%Rukmarathas%}), commanded by {%Karṇa%} and
devoted to {%Duḥśāsana%}, at {%Karṇa's%} command returning from
the pursuit of {%Arjuna%} and waiting for {%Sātyaki%}, and also ordered
by {%Duryodhana%}; he would also crush those 700 elephants ridden
by {%Kirātas%} (sprung from the race of {%Agni%}) ({%c%}) and formerly
given by the {%Kirāta%} king to {%Arjuna%}; obtaining these and
{%Kṛpa%}, etc. (ϕ), {%Duryodhana%} thought lightly of the {%Pāṇḍavas%};
“also the {%Kāmbojas%} (a full {%akṣauhiṇī%}) are on the alert with
their eyes on me.” Then {%Sātyaki%} directed his chariot to be
properly equipped; “I shall also have to encounter the
{%Śakas%}.” {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} caused quivers, etc., to be placed on
{%Sātyaki's%} chariot (with steeds of the {%Sindḥu%} breed); then
{%Sātyaki%} set out (description) with his charioteer and friend,
the younger brother of {%Dāruka. Bhīmasena%} also set out with
{%Sātyaki%}, but was prevailed upon by {%Sātyaki%} to return and
protect {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (VII, {@112@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} followed
{%Sātyaki%} in order to reach the chariot of {%Droṇa. Dhṛṣṭa-%}
{%dyumna%} and king {%Vasudāna%} urged the warriors to protect
{%Sātyaki. Sātyaki%} made the {%Kurus%} flee away. {%Droṇa &%}
{%Sātyaki%}, who then, like {%Arjuna%}, avoided {%Droṇa%}, pointing out
to his charioteer the {%Avantis%}, etc. (χ), and then smiting the
great host of {%Karṇa. Kṛtavarman & Sātyaki%}, who slew
{%Kṛtavarman's%} charioteer and issued out of the {%Bhoja%} division,
while {%Kṛtavarman%} (himself urging his steeds) attacked
{%Bhīmasena. Yuyudhāna%} & the {%Kāmbojas. Droṇa%} (making the
{%Bhoja%} king protect his troops) pursued {%Yuyudhāna%}, while the
{%Pāṇḍava%} host began to resist him. The {%Pāñcālas%} (headed by
{%Bhīmasena%}) & {%Kṛtavarman%} (VII, {@113@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} wondered
before {%Sañjaya%} that even such an army as his should be
slain (“it must be Destiny”), and asked about what passed.
{%Sañjaya%}, quoting {%Vidura%}, rebuked {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, and then
related: the {%Pārthas%} (ψ) (headed by {%Bhīmasena%}) & the {%Bhoja%}
king {%Kṛtavarman; Śikhaṇḍin%} was brought away from the battle
by his charioteer; {%Kṛtavarman%} vanquished all the {%Pārthas%},
etc. (ω) (VII, {@114@}). {%Sātyaki%} turned back to check {%Kṛta-%}
{%varman%}, whom he deprived of his chariot; then he broke the
hostile division and proceeded on his way. {%Sātyaki & Rukma-%}
{%ratha%} (with the {%Trigartas%} and elephants, to the left of {%Droṇa's%}
host; urged by {%Duryodhana%} they waited for {%Sātyaki%}); this
elephant division fled away. The {%Magadha%} king {%Jalasandha%}
(on an elephant) & {%Yuyudhāna%} (with white steeds), who slew
[Page361-a+ 63]
him; the {%Kurus%} fled away. {%Droṇa & Yuyudhāna%} (VII, {@115@}).
{%Droṇa%}, etc. (αα) & {%Yuyudhāna; Duryodhana%} fled away,
mounting the chariot of {%Citrasena. Kṛtavarman & Yuyudhāna%},
who made him fall on his knees (VII, {@116@}). {%Droṇa &%}
{%Sātyaki%}, whose driver swooned away; {%Sātyaki%}, acting as his
own driver, continued to fight with {%Droṇa%}, who was carried
away by his steeds; the troops broke. {%Droṇa%} returned to the
front of the array in order to check the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (VII, {@117@}).
King {%Sudarśana & Sātyaki%}, who slew him (VII, {@118@}).
{%Sātyaki's%} driver pronounced an eulogy (ββ) upon him.
{%Sātyaki%} urged him to take him to the {%Kāmbojas; Yuyudhāna%}
& the {%Yavanas%}, who fled away; thousands of {%Kāmbojas%}, etc.
(γγ), were similarly slain by {%Sātyaki%}; Cā. and G. applauded
him (VII, {@119@}). {%Yuyudhāna%} proceeded towards {%Arjuna%};
{%Duryodhana%}, etc. (δδ), followed him behind and attacked him
as he proceeded slowly; an awful carnage set in; {%Duryodhana's%}
chariot was taken away by the steeds; the others then fled
away. {%Yuyudhāna%} proceeded towards the chariot of {%Arjuna%}
(VII, {@120@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} wondered before {%Sañjaya%} at the
feats of {%Yuyudhāna%} (“I think Destiny is now unpropitious”).
{%Sañjaya%} blamed {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} and {%Duryodhana%}, and then
continued his narrative. At the command of {%Duryodhana%} the
{%Saṃśaptakas%} rallying, with a number of {%Śakas%}, etc. (εε)
(headed by {%Duryodhana%}), attacked {%Sātyaki; Duḥśāsana%} (with
a large force of robbers) & {%Sātyaki%}; many elephants of the
race of {%Añjana%}, etc. (ζζ), were slain, and many steeds of the
{%Vanāyu%} race, etc. (ηη), and many thousands of warriors;
many {%Daradas & Sātyaki%}; they fled away. {%Droṇa%}, hearing
the noise, told his charioteer to take the chariot to the spot
where {%Yuyudhāna%} was; the charioteer remarked that the
{%Pāñcālas%} and {%Pāṇḍavas%} were rushing against {%Droṇa%}; suddenly
{%Sātyaki%} appeared, and the broken troops and {%Duḥśāsana%}, all
struck with panic, rushed towards {%Droṇa's%} division (VII, {@121@}).
{%Droṇa%} rebuked {%Duḥśāsana%} for his cowardice (quoting his words
to {%Draupadī%}), and told him to make peace with the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
(θθ). {%Duḥśāsana%} (with {%Mlecchas%}) & {%Sātyaki. Droṇa%} & the
{%Pāñcālas%} + the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, etc. (ιι); {%Droṇa%} slew the {%Pāñśāla%}
prince {%Vīraketu%}, and his brothers {%Citraketu, Sudhanvan, Citra-%}
{%varman%}, and {%Citraratha; Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} mounted {%Droṇa's%}
chariot, but was then carried away by his own steeds; having
caused a great carnage {%Droṇa%} once more took up his station in
the midst of his own array (VII, {@122@}). {%Duḥśāsana & Sātyaki%};
the warriors of {%Duḥśāsana%} (but not himself) fled away.
{%Duryodhana%} urged a body of 3,000 {%Trigartas%} towards {%Yuyu-%}
{%dhāna%}, who slew 500; then they turned towards {%Droṇa%}.
While {%Sātyaki%} was proceeding towards {%Arjuna%} he was again
attacked by {%Duḥśāsana%}, who was taken up by the {%Trigarta%}
leader on his chariot; {%Sātyaki%} did not slay him, recollecting
the words of {%Bhīmasena%}, but quickly proceeded along the track
of {%Arjuna%} (VII, {@123@}). D. and Cā. wondered. {%Bhīmasena%},
etc. (κκ), & the {%Kauravas. Sātyaki%} proceeded towards {%Arjuna%}.
{%Duryodhana%} & the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (λλ); {%Duryodhana%} caused a great
carnage. {%Droṇa%} (in order to rescue {%Duryodhana%}) & the {%Pāñcālas%};
a dreadful carnage took place. Then there arose a loud
uproar from the place where {%Arjuna%} was (VII, {@124@}). In
the afternoon: {%Droṇa%} & the {%Somakas%} (and {%Pāṇḍavas%});
{%Bṛhatkṣattra%} (of the {%Kekayas%}) {%& Droṇa%}; both invoked the
{%Brāhma%} weapon; {%Bṛhatkṣattra%} was slain by {%Droṇa%}, who then
slew the {%Cedi Dhṛṣṭaketu%} (the son of {%Śiśupāla%}; with steeds
of the {%Kāmboja%} breed), and then {%Dhṛṣtaketu's%} son, and the
son of {%Jarāsandha%}. The {%Cedis%}, etc. (μμ), & {%Droṇa%}, who slew
them, especially the foremost among the {%Cedis%}. The {%Pāñcālas%}
began to tremble and loudly called for {%Bhīmasena%} and
[Page361-b+ 63]
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna. Droṇa%} slew {%Kṣatradharman%} ({%Dhṛṣṭa-%}
{%dyumna's%} son), and caused {%Cekitāna%} to be carried away by his
steeds. {%Drupada%} (censuring {%Duryodhana%}) (placing the {%Pārthas%}
at his head) & {%Droṇa%} (then 85 years of age, with white locks,
but behaving like a youth of 16) (VII, {@125@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
was anxious at not having obtained any intelligence of {%Arjuna%}
and {%Sātyaki%}, and thought of sending {%Bhīma%} after {%Sātyaki%},
asking him to send him a message by uttering a leonine roar
(VII, {@126@}). {%Bhīma%} requested {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} to protect
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, and prepared to set out (description) after
{%Sātyaki%} and {%Arjuna%}; the fierce blasts of {%Pāñcajanya%} were
heard, filling {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} with fear. {%Bhīma%} (with his
charioteer {%Viśoka%}) broke through the head of the {%Kuru%}
array; the {%Pāñcālas%} and {%Somakas%} followed him behind; the
brothers {%Duḥśala%}, etc. (νν), (with celestial weapons) he passed,
and rushed against {%Droṇa's%} division; {%Droṇa & Bhīmasena%};
{%Bhīma's%} mace pressed {%Droṇa's%} chariot down into the earth;
{%Droṇa%}, who had previously alighted, was saved; {%Bhīma%} slew
eleven sons of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra: Kuṇḍabhedin%}, etc. (ξξ); {%Dhṛta-%}
{%rāṣṭra's%} sons and the soldiers fled away. {%Bhīmasena%} then
passed towards the division of {%Droṇa%} (VII, {@127@}). {%Bhīma &%}
{%Droṇa; Bhīma%} passing through the {%Bhoja%}, etc. (οο), division
and beholding {%Sātyaki%}, proceeded with great speed and sighted
{%Arjuna%}, to whom he made his presence known by a roar;
{%Arjuna%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} uttered loud roars in return; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
understood that all was safe, and thought of {%Arjuna's%} feats
(ππ) (VII, {@128@}). {%Karṇa & Bhīmasena; Karṇa%} mounted the
chariot of {%Vṛṣasena; Bhīma%} uttered a loud roar that gratified
{%Yudhiṣṭhira. Arjuna%} stretched {%Gāṇḍīva%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} blew
{%Pāñcajanya%} (VII, {@129@}). {%Duryodhana%} saw {%Droṇa%}, and
affectionately chided him for his having allowed {%Sātyaki%} and
{%Bhīma%} to penetrate the {%Kuru%} host and approach to the aid of
{%Arjuna. Droṇa%} counselled {%Duryodhana%} to make effective
arrangements for the protection of {%Jayadratha%}. While going
back towards {%Jayadratha, Duryodhana%} encountered the two
brothers, the {%Pāñcāla%} princes, {%Yudhāmanyu%} and {%Uttamaujas%},
the protectors of the wheels of {%Arjuna's%} chariot, who had
formerly, while {%Arjuna%} penetrated the {%Kuru%} host, been
checked in their progress by {%Kṛtavarman%}, and were now
proceeding towards {%Arjuna%} by the flank of the {%Kuru%} army.
{%Uttamaujas%} ascended the chariot of {%Yudhāmanyu%}, which
{%Duryodhana%} pressed down into the earth with his mace, and
then {%Duryodhana%} ascended the chariot of the {%Madra%} king;
{%Yudhāmanyu%} and {%Uttamaujas%}, ascending two other chariots,
proceeded towards {%Arjuna%} (VII, {@130@}). {%Karṇa%} proceeded
against {%Bhīma. Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} inquired about the battle (ρρ).
{%Sañjaya%} related: {%Bhīma%} desired to avoid {%Karṇa%} and to proceed
towards {%Arjuna; Karṇa%} insultingly challenged {%Bhīma%}, who
turned back and encountered {%Karṇa%}; a fierce battle ensued
between {%Bhīma%} and {%Karṇa%}, whom {%Bhīma%} deprived of his
steeds and chariot. {%Karṇa%} mounted another chariot (VII,
{@131@}). Continuation of the battle between {%Karṇa%} and
{%Bhīma%}, who recollected the woes in {%Virāṭa's%} city, etc. (σσ).
{%Bhīma's%} horses of the hue of bears and {%Karṇa's%} of the hue
of swans mingled together; {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%} became
anxious for {%Bhīma%}; a great carnage took place (VII, {@132@}).
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} eulogy on {%Bhīma%} (ττ); {%Karṇa%} was capable of
encountering D., As., and men. {%Sañjaya%} continued: {%Bhīma%}
again deprived {%Karṇa%} of his steeds and driver. {%Duryodhana%}
dispatched his brother {%Durjaya%} to rescue {%Karṇa; Bhīma%} slew
{%Durjaya; Karṇa%} wept (VII, {@133@}). Riding upon another
chariot {%Karṇa%} again encountered {%Bhīma%}, who again deprived
him of his chariot. {%Duryodhana%} dispatched his brother
[Page362-a+ 63]
{%Durmukha%} to rescue {%Karṇa; Bhīma%} slew {%Durmukha%}, upon
whose chariot {%Karṇa%} mounted, weeping; {%Karṇa%} fled, carried
away by his steeds (VII, {@134@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} observations
on {%Bhīma's%} victory over {%Karṇa%} (υυ); “I think Destiny reigns
supreme.” {%Sañjaya%} called {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} “the root of this
destruction of the world”; then he related: five brothers of
{%Duryodhana%} (ϕϕ) + {%Karṇa & Bhīmasena%}, who slew the five
brothers, resisting {%Karṇa%} the while (VII, {@135@}). {%Karṇa%}
became despondent of his life; {%Bhīma%} again deprived {%Karṇa%}
of his steeds, driver, and bow; {%Karṇa%} once more fled on foot;
{%Duryodhana%} dispatched other brothers of his against {%Bhīma%},
who slew them all (χχ). {%Karṇa%} wept, recollecting the words
of {%Vidura%}; then, riding upon another chariot he encountered
{%Bhīma%} (description), who gladdened {%Arjuna%}, etc. (ψψ) (VII,
{@136@}). {%Karṇa%} sorrowfully surveyed the slain brothers of
{%Duryodhana%}, and was hard pressed by {%Bhīma%}, who was
applauded by Cā., {%Bhūriśravas%}, etc. (ωω); {%Duryodhana%} dis-
patched seven of his brothers to the rescue of {%Karṇa%}; they
were all slain by {%Bhīma%} (ααα); {%Bhīma%} lamented the
death of {%Vikarṇa%}, who was dear to him. Then he with
a shout gladdened {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, who rushed against {%Droṇa%}.
Beholding the slaughter of thirty-one of his brothers by
{%Bhīma, Duryodhana%} recollected the words of {%Vidura%} (βββ)
(VII, {@137@}). {%Bhīma & Karṇa%}; a great carnage was caused by
both ({%Sindhus, Sauvīras, Kauravas%}); Cā. and Si. were amazed
(VII, {@138@}). Continuation: D-ṛ., Si., G., and Vd. applauded
the two combatants. Pierced by {%Karṇa, Bhīma's%} driver
sought refuge in {%Sātyaki's%} chariot; {%Karṇa%} cut off {%Bhīma's%}
weapons; {%Bhīma%} leaped into the sky in order to snatch {%Karṇa%}
off his chariot; {%Karṇa%} concealed himself on his vehicle; the
{%Kurus%} and Cā. applauded {%Bhīma; Bhīma's%} weapons being
exhausted he fled away from {%Karṇa%} and defended himself with
the bodies of the elephants slain by {%Arjuna%}; but, recollecting
{%Arjuna's%} vow, he did not take the life of {%Karṇa%}; and {%Karṇa%},
recollecting his promise to {%Kuntī%}, did not take the life of {%Bhīma%},
whom he touched with the end of his bow and insulted with
his speech. {%Arjuna%} then forced {%Karṇa%} to fly, and speeded
a terrible shaft after him when he was retreating, which was
cut off by {%Aśvatthāman%}, whom {%Arjuna%} then forced to flee away
(VII, {@139@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} lamented (γγγ). {%Sañjaya%} related:
{%Sātyaki%} followed {%Bhīma; Alambuṣa%} ({%rājavaro%}, v. †5828) &
{%Sātyaki%}, who slew him (!), and then proceeded, with his
steeds of the {%Sindhu%} breed, towards {%Arjuna; Duḥśāsana%} and
the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras & Sātyaki%}, who slew the steeds of
{%Duḥśāsana%}, gladdening. {%Arjuna%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} (VII, {@140@}).
Fifty {%Trigarta%} princes & {%Sātyaki%}, who made them flee away,
and then, passing through the {%Śūrasenas%} and {%Kaliṅgas%},
approached {%Arjuna%}, and was eulogized (δδδ) by {%Kṛṣṇa%}.
{%Arjuna%} was not pleased with the arrival of {%Sātyaki%} on
account of his anxiety for {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (εεε) (VII, {@141@}).
{%Bhūriśravas & Sātyaki%}; they mutually addressed (ζζζ) and
challenged each other, whereafter the fight began; each
deprived the other of his chariot, then they fought with
swords, then with fists and hands (descriptions); {%Kṛṣṇa%} urged
{%Arjuna%} to protect the tired {%Sātyaki%} against {%Bhūriśravas%}, who
was fresh; {%Sātyaki%} succumbed to {%Bhūriśravas; Arjuna%} cut
off one of the arms of {%Bhūriśravas%} (VII, {@142@}). {%Bhūriśravas%}
rebuked {%Arjuna%} for his unrighteous feat (ηηη); {%Arjuna%}
justified his conduct (θθθ). {%Bhūriśravas (b%}), abandoning
{%Yuyudhāna%}, desired to die in {%prāya%} (description); he
acknowledged the justice of {%Arjuna's%} plea, and was blessed
by {%Arjuna%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} (ιιι). Though forbidden by {%Kṛṣṇa%},
etc. (κκκ), {%Sātyaki%} slew {%Bhūriśravas%} sitting in {%prāya%}. The
[Page362-b+ 63]
warriors did not applaud {%Sātyaki%}; Si., Cā., men, and D.
applauded {%Bhūriśravas%}; the soldiers thought that it had been
ordained by the Creator that it should be so. {%Sātyaki%} justified
his conduct (λλλ), quoting {%Vālmīki%} (VII, {@143@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
asked {%Sañjaya%} how {%Sātyaki%} could be humiliated by {%Bhūriśravas%}.
{%Sañjaya%} related the history of {%Śini (e%}) and of {%Somadatta%}, and
praised the {%Vṛṣṇi%} heroes, vanquishers of the very D., Dā., G.,
As., Y., U., and Rā. (VII, {@144@}). {%Arjuna%} proceeded to
{%Jayadratha's%} chariot. {%Duryodhana%}, etc. (μμμ) & {%Arjuna%} (μμμ).
{%Duryodhana%} prevailed upon {%Karṇa%} to protect {%Jayadratha%} (ννν);
{%Karṇa%} promised to do his best (ξξξ); {%Duryodhana%}, etc. (οοο)
(also {%Aśvatthāman%}) ({%f) & Arjuna%} (+ {%Bhīmasena%} and {%Yuyu-%}
{%dhāna%}); Si., Cā., and Pn. applauded {%Karṇa%} and {%Arjuna%}.
{%Arjuna%} deprived {%Karṇa%} of his steeds, chariot, and driver.
{%Aśvatthāman%} made {%Karṇa%} ride on his chariot. {%Arjuna%}
invoked the {%Vāruṇa%} weapon; he caused a great carnage
(VII, {@145@}). {%Arjuna%} employed the {%Aindra%} weapon, etc.
(description). {%Arjuna & Jayadratha%} (+ οοο); {%Arjuna%} cut off
{%Jayadratha's%} standard and slew his driver; {%Jayadratha%} was
placed by six chariot warriors in their midst. {%Kṛṣṇa%} covered
the sun by means of his {%yoga%} power, so that all, except
{%Arjuna%}, thought the sun to have set, and he urged {%Arjuna%} to
cut off {%Jayadratha's%} head without delay; {%Arjuna%} caused such
a carnage that the warriors abandoned {%Jayadratha%} in fear and
fled away; {%Kṛṣṇa%} again urged {%Arjuna%} to cut off {%Jayadratha's%}
head without delay, telling him of {%Jayadratha's%} father {%Vṛddha-%}
{%kṣatra (g%}), who was still engaged in penances outside
{%Samantapañcaka; Arjuna%} should make the head fall upon
the lap of {%Vṛddhakṣatra%} himself, lest his own head should
crack in 100 pieces; this {%Arjuna%} did, and as the head fell
down from {%Vṛddhakṣatra's%} lap the latter's head split into
100 pieces. {%Kṛṣṇa%} then withdrew the darkness created by
him; {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%} blew their conches, and {%Bhīma%}, by
a tremendous shout, communicated to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} the message
of victory. {%Yudhiṣṭhira & Droṇa%}, after the sun had set; and
{%Arjuna%} fought with many mighty chariot warriors (VII, {@146@}).
{%Kṛpa + Aśvatthāman & Arjuna; Kṛpa%} was carried away by
his driver, and {%Aśvatthāman%} fled. {%Arjuna%}, grieved at {%Kṛpa's%}
death-like swoon (πππ), {%Karṇa & Arjuna + Sātyaki +%} the
two {%Pāñcāla%} princes ({%Arjuna's%} wheel protectors). {%Kṛṣṇa%}
told {%Arjuna%} to avoid {%Karṇa%} because the latter had yet the
lance that {%Indra%} had given him. {%Karṇa & Sātyaki%} (upon
{%Kṛṣṇa's%} chariot with {%Dāruka%} and the horses {%Śaibya%}, etc.
(ρρρ), {%Kṛṣṇa%} having known before the encounter that
{%Sātyaki%} would be deprived of his chariot by {%Bhūriśravas%}, and
having therefore ordered {%Dāruka%} to let his chariot be equipped
the next day, and now calling {%Dāruka%} by blowing his conch
in the {%Ṛṣabha%} note; neither D., G., Y., U., Rā., nor men could
conquer the two {%Kṛṣṇas%}; D. with {%Brahmán%} and Si. knew
their prowess); {%Yudhāmanyu%} and {%Uttamaujas%} (abandoning
{%Arjuna's%} chariot) & {%Karṇa%}; such a battle had never been
heard of even between D., G., As., U., or Rā.; D., G., and
Dā. looked at; {%Sātyaki%} slew {%Karṇa's%} charioteer and steeds.
{%Vṛṣasena%}, etc. (σσσ), & {%Sātyaki. Karṇa%} ascended the
chariot of {%Duryodhana. Sātyaki%} did not slay the {%Dhārta-%}
{%rāṣṭras%} ({%Duḥśāsana%}, etc.) on account of the vow of {%Bhīmasena%}.
{%Aśvatthāman, Kṛtavarman%}, etc., were all vanquished by
{%Sātyaki%} with only one bow; “in this world there are only
three mighty bowmen: {%Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna%}, and {%Sātyaki%},” said
Sañjaya. The younger brother of {%Dāruka%} soon brought
another chariot (description) to {%Sātyaki; Sātyaki%} ascended it,
and {%Dāruka%} went to {%Kṛṣṇa%}. A new chariot was brought for
{%Karṇa%} also. {%Sañjaya%} told {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} that thirty-one of his
[Page363-a+ 63]
sons had been slain by {%Bhīmasena%}, etc. (τττ) (VII, {@147@}).
Insulted by {%Karṇa, Bhīma%} addressed {%Arjuna%} in order to induce
the latter to permit him to slay {%Karṇa; Arjuna%} rebuked {%Karṇa%}
(υυυ), and vowed to slay his son {%Vṛṣasena%} in his presence.
{%Kṛṣṇa%} congratulated {%Arjuna%} (ϕϕϕ), who attributed the
victory to {%Kṛṣṇa; Kṛṣṇa%} pointed out to {%Arjuna%} the results
of that day's battle; then he blew {%Pāñcajanya%} and went and
informed {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (VII, {@148@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} congratulated
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, who attributed the success to {%Kṛṣṇa's%} grace
(χχχ); {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%} once more congratulated him
(ψψψ); then {%Bhīma%} and {%Sātyaki%}, whom {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
congratulated (ωωω) and embraced (VII, {@149@}). {%Duryodhana's%}
despondency (αʹ) and cheerless address to {%Droṇa%} (βʹ), whom
he censured for treating {%Arjuna%} leniently; “it seems that
{%Karṇa%} only now wishes us victory” (VII, {@150@}). {%Droṇa's%}
reply to {%Duryodhana%} (γʹ); he vowed to slay all the {%Pāñcālas%}
before doffing his armour; he asked {%Duryodhana%} to tell
{%Aśvatthāman%} to avenge himself on the {%Somakas%}, etc., even at
the risk of his life. Then he proceeded against the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
(VII, {@151@}). {%Duryodhana%} communicated to {%Karṇa%} his
suspicions about {%Droṇa's%} sincerity (δʹ); {%Karṇa%} removed
{%Duryodhana's%} suspicions of {%Droṇa%} (εʹ), and attributed the
ill-success of the {%Kurus%} to destiny. Meanwhile the {%Pāṇḍava%}
divisions appeared for battle, and a fierce battle ensued
(VII, {@152@}).
