[{@Viśvāmitropākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode relating to
Viśvāmitra”): § 721{%b%} (Ānuśāsanik.). {%Bhīṣma%} said: King
{%Ajamīḍha%} (of {%Bharata's%} race) > king {%Jahnu%} (who got {%Gaṅgā%}
for his daughter) > {%Sindhudvīpa%} (virtuous) > R-ṛ {%Balākāśva%}
{%> Vallabha > Kuśika > Gādhi%}, who, being childless and
desiring to have a son, repaired to the forest, where the
beautiful {%Satyavatī%} was born to him. {%Cyavana's%} son, {%Ṛcīka%}
{%Bhārgava%}, asked for her hand; but as he was poor, {%Gādhi%}
required of him as a dower 1,000 white horses having one
black ear, which he obtained from {%Varuṇa%} (by thinking of
them at {%Aśvatīrtha%}, on the bank of the {%Gaṅgā%}, not far from
{%Kānyakubja%}). {%Ṛcīka%} granted her a boon, that she should
have a son; she related this to her mother, who prevailed
upon her to obtain a son also for her; having promised them
both a son, he told the mother to embrace an {%aśvattha%} tree
and {%Satyavatī%} an {%uḍumbara%} tree, and each of them to eat a
certain {%caru%} (sacrificial offering), consecrated with hymns.
The mother exchanged both the trees and the {%carus. Ṛcīka%}
had placed the entire {%brahman%}-energy in {%Satyavatī's caru%} and
the {%kṣatriya%}-energy in that of her mother; “therefore, thy
mother will give birth to an excellent brahman and thou to
a terrible {%kṣatriya%}.” {%Satyavatī%} prevailed upon him, that
not her son, but her son's son should be such. Then, by the
favour of {%Ṛcīka%}, she gave birth to {%Jamadagni%}, and the wife
of {%Gādhi%} to the Brahmarṣi (read {%brahmarṣiṃ%}) {%Viśvāmitra%},
versed in the {%Vedas (brahmavādinaṃ). Viśvāmitra%} attained
to the state of a brahman, and became the founder of a race
of brahmans. {%Madhucchanda%}, etc., (β), were all sons of
{%Viśvāmitra%} (XIII, {@4@}).
