had come to Vaivasvata; Dharmarāja (i.e. Yama) himself had
dwelt there; there all the rivers take their rise ({%samudbhedaḥ%})
and {%Mahādeva%} is always present; there the Pāṇḍavas per-
formed {%cāturmāsya%} sacrifices together with the great {%ṛṣiyajña%}
(v. BR.). There is the Akṣayavaṭa (“the imperishable
[Page166-a+ 63]
banian”), the imperishable sacrificial platform of the gods,
where the merit acquired is imperishable. Here they fasted
with concentrated souls, and brahmans by hundred came
and performed the {%cāturmāsya%} sacrifice and talked about
various sacred subjects, and the learned and pious Śamatha,
who lived in celibacy ({%kaumāraṃ vratam āṣṭhitaḥ%}), told them
