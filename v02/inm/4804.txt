[{@Jāpakopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode about the reciter
of sacred mantras”). § 662{%b%} (Mokṣadh.): A brahman, who
was a reciter, conversant with the six {%Aṅgas%}, of the {%Kuśika%}
race and son of {%Pippalāda%}, acquired spiritual insight into the
{%Aṅgas%}; at the foot of {%Himavat%} he was devoted to the {%Vedas%};
silently reciting {%Gāyatrī%}, he practised austerities for 1,000
years in order to attain to {%Bráhman%}. Then {%Gāyatrī (Sāvitrī%})
appeared and granted him the boon that his wish for recitation
should go on increasing, and his absorption into meditation
({%samādhi%}) be more complete. She added that he should not
have to go to hell, thither where great brahmans go, but to
the region of {%Brahmán%}, and that {%Dharma%}, etc. (α), would come
to him in person. He continued engaged in recitation for
1,000 celestial years. Then {%Dharma%} came to him and told
him to cast off his body in order to win regions of bliss;
but he did not wish to reside in heaven except with his
body, but only took pleasure in recitation. {%Time, Mṛtyu%}, and
{%Yama%} came and told him the same. The brahman gave them
{%arghya%} and {%pādya. Ikṣvāku%}, who had set out on a {%tīrtha-%}
{%yātrā%}, came and was given {%arghya%} and {%pādya%}. The brahman
wished to give him something; {%Ikṣvāku%}, as a kṣatriya, would
not take anything except battle, but only himself give; at last,
however, he asked to be allowed to enjoy the fruits of the
brahman's recitations, but when the brahman consented he
would not take them, and asked the brahman what those fruits
were. The brahman did not know, as his recitations had
never been connected with any special purpose; he told the
king that Truth required that he should take them as he
had asked for them (the signification of Truth). {%Dharma%}
and Heaven ({%Svargaḥ%}) seconded the brahman. {%Ikṣvāku%}
wished to give his own merits instead, but in vain then
{%Ikṣvāku%} agreed to accept half the brahman's merit on the
condition that the brahman should take half of his own,
but he was refused. At this time two ungainly individuals
came there, {%Virūpa%} and {%Vikṛta%} (afterwards disclosed to be
{%Desire%} and {%Wrath%}) {%Virūpa%} said that he owed {%Vikṛta%} the
merits of the gift of a cow, but that {%Vikṛta%} refused to take
repayment (in the form of the merit of having given two
{%kapilā%} cows with calves to an {%uñchavṛtti%}); {%Vikṛta%} declared
that {%Virūpa%} owed him nothing; they asked {%Ikṣvāku%} to decide
the question. {%Ikṣvāku%} hesitated; the brahman threatened to
curse him. {%Ikṣvāku%} would give him some drops of water
that had fallen upon his hand. {%Virūpa%} approved of this
arrangement, and said that {%Vikṛta%} really did not owe him
anything; “we appealed to thee for thy own sake.” {%Bhīṣma%}
said that a reciter goes to {%Brahmán%}, or {%Agni%}, or {%Sūrya%}. whose
attributes he catches stupefied by attachment ({%rāgeṇa%}); and
so also if he goes to {%Soma%}, etc. (β); if, however, he goes to,
those regions after having freed himself from attachment, he
enters the Supreme and Imperishable, and becomes {%Bráhman%}
(XII, {@199@}). The brahman accepted, worshipped {%Dharma%},
etc. (γ), and set himself to his recitations again. Asked by
{%Ikṣvāku%}, he agreed that he should go half and half with the
king. {%Indra%} came there with D., Lp., Sā., Vi., etc. (δ), and
said to the brahman and the king that they had attained to
success ({%[saṃ]siddhaḥ%}). Those two withdrew their senses
from the objects of the world; fixing {%Praṇa%}, etc. (ε), in the
[Page354-a+ 63]
heart, they concentrated the mind in {%Prāṇa%} and {%Apāna%}
united together, etc. (description). {%Brahmán%} welcomed the
fiery flame that had issued from the head of the brahman,
saying: “Reciters attain to the same end as the {%yogins%};
but as regards reciters, the honour is ordained for them that
{%Brahmán%} himself shall advance to receive them”; then he
once more imparted consciousness into that splendour; the
brahman then entered the mouth of {%Brahmán%}, and so did the
king. The deities rejoiced. {%Brahmán%} said that so also would
he that reads “the great {%Smṛti%}” and “the {%Anusmṛti%}”
(i.e. resp. “the six {%Aṅgas%} and {%Manu%}, etc.,” Nīl.) in this
way attain to the same region with {%Brahmán%}; and so also he
who is devoted to {%Yoga%}. Then {%Brahmán%} disappeared, and
the deities, having honoured {%Dharma%}, returned to their
respective abodes (XII, {@200@}).
