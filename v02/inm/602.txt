{@Āṅgirasa(ṃ)@}¦ (“on the descendants of Aṅgiras”). § 488
(Mārk.): Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Mārkaṇḍeya%} related the
following “old story” ({%itihāsaṃ purātanaṃ): Aṅgiras%} (the
third son of Brahmán, v. 14122) in days of yore practised
austerities in his hermitage, so that he excelled {%Agni%}, who,
thinking that {%Brahmán%} had created a new Fire, was greatly
depressed, but {%Aṅgiras%}, saying that {%Agni%} had been created by
{%Brahmán%} to officiate as fire, asked him to occupy his proper
place, and when {%Agni%} only wished to be the second or {%Prājā-%}
{%patyaka%} fire, at last prevailed upon him to remain and make
[Page040-a+ 142]
him (i.e. Aṅgiras) his first son. {%Aṅgiras%} also had a son,
{%Bṛhaspati%}; knowing him the {%Āṅgirasa%} to be the firstborn son
of Fire, the gods came and learned the matter from {%Aṅgiras%}
(III, {@217@}).—§ 489: The children of {%Aṅgiras%} and {%Śubhā%}
(B. {%Subhā%}): the son {%Bṛhaspati%}, and the eight daughters,
{%Bhānumatī, Rāgā, Sinībālī%}, also called {%Kapardisutā%}, because
she was both visible and invisible, {%Arciṣmatī, Haviṣmatī%},
{%Mahiṣmatī, Mahāmatī%}, and {%Kuhū%} (III, {@218@}).—§ 490:

§ 491: With {%Kāśyapa, Vāsiṣṭha, Prāṇa%}, son of {%Prāṇa%},
{%Agni Āṅgirasa%}, || and {%Cyavana Trisvarcaka%},|| he,§ after a
penance lasting for many years, obtained the son {%Pañcajanya%}
(“appertaining to five men and the progenitor of five tribes,”
v. 14160). {%Pāñcajanya%} (= {%Tapas%}, v. 14166—8, 14173, 14174),
after 10,000 years of penances, produced the fire of the
{%Pitṛs%}; from his head he created {%Bṛhat%} and {%Rathantara%}, from
his mouth {%Vāta%} and {%Rasāhara%},¶ in his navel Śiva, from his
might ({%balād) Indra%}, from his soul ({%prāṇato) Vāyu%} and {%Agni%},
from his arms {%Anudāttau%},** and {%Viśve%}†† (!) and the elements
({%bhūtāni%}), and then the five sons of the {%Pitṛs. Bṛhadratha's%}
son was {%Praṇidhi, Kāśyapa's Mahattara, Āṅgiras' Bhānu%},
{%Varca's Saubhara%}, and {%Prāṇa's Anudātta%}, in all twenty-five.
—§ 492: He also produced three times five {%devāḥ: Yajña-%}
{%muṣaḥ%} (“who steal the sacrifices”), {%Subhīma, Atibhīma%},
{%Bhīma, Bhīmabala, Abala, Sumitra, Mitravaṭ, Mitrajña%},
[Page040-b+ 63]
{%Mitravardhana, Mitradharman%},* {%Surapravīra, Vīra, Suveśa%},
{%Suravarcas%}, and {%“Surāṇām api hantṛ.”%}—§ 493: {%Bṛhaduktha%}
and {%Rathantara%} (cf. § 491) or {%Mitravinda%}, sons of {%Tapas%}
(III, {@220@}). Many “fires” enumerated, among others the
five {%Ūrjaskarāḥ%} ({%Purandara, Uṣman, Manu, Śambhu%}, and
{%Āvasathya%}), sons of {%Tapas%}; the six sons of {%Bhānu%} with his
wives {%Suprajā%} and {%Bṛhadbhāsā Sūryajā (Balada, Manyumat%},
{%Viṣṇu = Dhrtimat = Aṅgiras, Āgrayaṇa, Agraha, Stubha%}).
{%Niśā%} was likewise the wife of {%Bhānu%}, and gave birth to one
daughter, to {%Agni%} and {%Soma%}, and to five Fires ({%Pāvakān%}). The
Fire ({%Pāvaka%}) who in company with {%Parjanya%} is honoured
with the first {%havis%} at the {%Cāturmāsyas%} is {%Agni Vaiśvānara%}.
He who is called the lord of all the world is {%Viśvapati%}, the
second son of {%Manu%}, etc. (III, {@221@}). Genealogy of the Fires
continued. The Fire {%Saha%}, from fear of his grandson the
Fire {%Bharata (Bhara, Niyata%}), who burns the dead bodies,
hid himself in the sea,† asking {%Atharvan%} to carry the oblations
to the gods. When his place of concealment had been
divulged by the fishes, {%Saha%} cursed them, saying that they
should become the food of all creatures in various ways. Then
{%Saha%} gave up his body and entered the earth, where he created
various metals: from his pus ({%pūyāt%}) force ({%tejaḥ%}) and scent,
from his bones the {%devadāru%}, from his phlegm glass ({%sphāṭikaṃ%}),
from his bile {%mārakata%}, from his liver the black iron, the
clouds from his nails, the corals from his veins, etc., and
remained absorbed in meditation, whence he was roused by
the {%tapas%} of {%Bhṛgu, Āṅgiras%}, etc. Seeing the {%ṛṣhi%} (i.e.
Atharvāṅgirasa, Nīl. = Atharvan, PCR.), he again took refuge
in the water. The whole world with the gods sought the
protection of {%Atharvan%}, who searched the sea, and finding
the Fire, created the worlds (so Nīl. and PCR.). So {%Agni%} was
formerly destroyed by {%Atharvan%}, and called back ({%āhūtaḥ(?%}),
PCR.) he carries the oblations, and travelling about various
countries and living there (i.e. in the sea, PCR.), he produced
the various fires mentioned in the {%Vedas%}.—§ 494: Enumeration
of rivers that are said to be the mothers of the fires. The wife
of {%Adbhuta%} was {%Priyā%}, and his son {%Vibhūrasi%} (14234). There
are as many {%somas%} (i.e. kinds of {%soma%} sacrifices, Nīl. and PCR.)
as the number of fires mentioned. Also in the race of {%Atri%}
[these] mind-born sons of {%Brahmán%} (?) ‡ sprang forth. {%Atri%},
wishing to procreate sons, conceived these [fires] in his mind,
and the fires came out of his, the brahman's, body.|| The
powers of these fires are the same as those of the {%Adbhuta%} fire
as related in the {%Vedas%}, for they are all one and the same, the
first {%Aṅgiras%}, sprung from [his] body in various forms like
the {%jyotiṣṭoma%} sacrifice (III, {@222@}).
