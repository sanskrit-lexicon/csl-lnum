[{@Nahuṣopākhyāna@}]¦ (“the episode relating to Nahuṣa”).
§ 755{%b%} (Ānuśāsanik.): {%Nahuṣa%}, having acquired the
sovereignty of heaven, performed both human and celestial
acts, for instance {%bali%} and offering of incense and of light, etc.;
and although he had become the chief of the gods, he yet
worshipped the gods as in days of yore. But then he was
filled with pride in consequence of the boon he had received
from all the gods, and he ceased to perform religious actions;
for a very long time he used to employ the Ṛ. by turns as the
bearers of his vehicles; but in consequence of his abstention
from religious acts his energy began to diminish; when it was
{%Agastya's%} turn to carry the vehicle, {%Bhṛgu%} came to the hermitage
of {%Agastya (Maitrāvaruṇi%}), and when the latter, mentioning
{%Brahmán's%} boon to {%Nahuṣa%} (that whoever would come within
the range of his eyesight would, deprived of all energy, be
within his sway), and that {%Brahmán%} had given him {%aṃṛta%}
[Page495-b+ 63]
to drink, despaired of being able to curse him, {%Bhṛgu%} said
that he had come at the command of {%Brahmán%}, and that he
would curse {%Nahuṣa%} to be a snake, when he insulted {%Agastya%}
by a kick, and this very day he would hurl him down and
re-establish {%Indra. Agastya%} became highly gratified (XIII,
{@99@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} continued [referring
to and developing the beginning of XIII, {@99@}: {%Nahuṣa's%}
sacrificial rites and presents were obstructed by Rā.]: {%Nahuṣa%}
ordered Ṛ. {%Agastya%} to carry the vehicle from the banks of
{%Sarasvatī. Bhṛgu%}, telling {%Agastya%} to close his eyes, had
entered the matted locks of {%Agastya%}, taking care not to cast
his eyes upon {%Nahuṣa. Nahuṣa%} urged {%Agastya%} on with
his goad and then struck him on the head with his left foot.
Then {%Nahuṣa%} was cursed by {%Bhṛgu%} and transformed into
a snake, but, in consequence of his gifts, etc., he retained his
memory, and, assisted by {%Agastya%}, pacified {%Bhṛgu%}, who said
that {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} would rescue him, and then went to the
abode of {%Brahmán%} and informed him, while {%Agastya%} returned
to his own hermitage. {%Brahmán%} once more installed (caused
the gods to instal) {%Indra%} in the sovereignty of heaven. “Thou
hast, O king, rescued {%Nahuṣa%} from {%Bhṛgu's%} curse; he ascended
to the abode of {%Brahmán%} before thy eyes; in consequence of
the merits he had acquired through acts of the kind I have
mentioned, he succeeded in once more regaining his lost
position. Hence, when evening comes, persons leading the
domestic mode of life, should give lamps” (XIII, {@100@}).
