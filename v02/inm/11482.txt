§ 461 (Mārkaṇḍeyas.). As {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} wished to hear
about the greatness of {%brahmans, Mārkaṇḍeya%} related: King
{%Parikṣit%} (B. {%Parīkṣit%}), in {%Ayodhyā%}, of the race of {%Ikṣvāku%},
was, in the forest, led far away by a deer, and by a tank
met with a beautiful maiden, who came along singing. He
married her after having given her the pledge not to let her
see water, and having arrived at his capital he lived with
her in privacy, and nobody could obtain any interview with
him. His chief minister, having found out the matter, made
an artificial forest, with a tank covered with a net of pearls,
and showed it to the king. The king told his wife to plunge
into this tank. She did so, and did not reappear. When
the water had been baled out a frog was found. The king
ordered all frogs to be slaughtered. {%Āyu%}, the king of the
frogs, in the shape of an ascetic (quoting two {%ślokas%}: “Do
not wish to kill the frogs, etc.”), told him that the queen
was his daughter {%Suśobhanā%}, who had deceived many kings.
She was restored to the king, but {%Āyu%} cursed her, saying:
“Thy offspring shall prove disrespectful to brahmans.”
{%Parikṣit%} begot three sons on her: {%Śala, Dala%}, and {%Bala%}.
Having installed {%Śala%} on the throne, {%Parikṣit%} retired to the
wood. One day, {%Śala%}, as he could not overtake a deer, forced
his charioteer to indicate to him, to whom the {%Vāmya%} horses be-
longed. He borrowed them from the {%ṛṣi Vāmadeva%} and caught
the deer, but did not return them. After a month, {%Vāmadeva%}
in vain sent his disciple {%Ātreya%}, and then came himself, and
asked for the steeds. The king, saying that such horses were
not fit for brahmans, in vain offered to give him two bulls, then
four asses or four mules, and as he threatened to let him be
killed, {%Vāmadeva%}, saying that {%brahmans%} could not be punished,
let four {%Rākṣasas%} slay him with their lances. {%Dala%}, whom
the {%Ikṣvākus%} installed on the throne, attempted to shoot
{%Vāmadeva%} with a poisoned arrow, but shot his own son
{%Śyenajit%}, and was unable to discharge another poisoned arrow.
Then he gave way, and, advised by {%Vāmadeva%}, he touched his
queen with the arrow and was thus purified of his sin. The
queen obtained the boon from {%Vāmadeva%}, that she might
prevail upon her husband that they both should serve the
{%brahmans%}, and he be freed from his sin, and that {%Vāmadeva%}
should think of their weal. The king became glad and
restored the {%Vāmya%} horses (III, {@192@}).
