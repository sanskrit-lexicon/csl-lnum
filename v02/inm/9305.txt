[{@Sainyodyogaparvan(°va)@}]¦ (“the section relating to
the preparations before warfare,” the 57th of the minor
parvans of Mhbhr.). § 554: After the nuptials of {%Abhimanyu%}
the {%Kurus%}, etc. (α) next morning assembled in the presence
chamber of {%Virāṭa. Kṛṣṇa%} spoke about the affairs of the
{%Pāṇḍavas%}, and proposed to send an ambassador to {%Duryodhana%},
etc., in order to induce them to give half the kingdom to
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (V, {@1@}). {%Baladeva%} approved of it, and said that
the ambassador ought to salute {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (β), that
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} had been wrong in challenging {%Śakuni%}, and
that {%Duryodhana%} only ought to be addressed in a conciliatory
tone, that war might be avoided (V, {@2@}). {%Sātyaki%} severely
blamed {%Baladeva%}, and asserted that it was {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} who
had been challenged in the game at dice, that he could not
have declined according to the rules of the Kṣatriya caste,
[Page609-a+ 63]
and that {%Śakuni%} had won by a trick; the {%Kauravas%} had not
obeyed {%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa%}; they ought to be besought by
sharp arrows; they could not withstand {%Yuyudhāna%}, etc.
(ββ) (V, {@3@}). {%Drupada%} approved of what had been said by
{%Baladeva%}, except that {%Duryodhana%} should not be addressed
mildly, and they ought also to send messengers to {%Śalya%}, etc.
(γ) to collect an army; his own {%purohita%} ought to be sent to
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Duryodhana, Bhīṣma%}, and {%Droṇa%} (V, {@4@}).
Having approved of {%Drupada's%} words, {%Kṛṣṇa%} set out for
{%Dvārakā%}, and the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%} began to
make preparations for war, and collect troops; and {%Drupada%}
despatched his {%purohita%} to the {%Kurus%} (V, {@5@}). {%Drupada%} gave
instructions to his {%purohita%} (cf. Puṣya, § 554), who set
out for {%Hāstinapura%} with a following of disciples (V, {@6@}).
After {%Kṛṣṇa%}, etc. (γγ) had set out for {%Dvārakā, Arjuna%} and
{%Duryodhana%} come thither, while {%Kṛṣṇa%} was asleep;
{%Duryodhana%} sat down at the head of the bed; after him
{%Arjuna%} came and stood at the back of the bed. And when
{%Kṛṣṇa%} awoke, he first saw {%Arjuna. Arjuna%} chose for his
partner {%Kṛṣṇa%} himself, who was not to fight; {%Duryodhana%}
selected for himself {%Kṛṣṇa's%} ten crores of {%Nārāyaṇa%} cowherds.
{%Balarāma%} said he would fight neither for {%Kuntī's%} sons
nor for {%Duryodhana. Kṛtavarman%} gave an {%akṣauhiṇī%} to
{%Duryodhana. Kṛṣṇa%} promised to become {%Arjuna's%} charioteer;
{%Arjuna%} came back to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} with {%Kṛṣṇa%} and the
flower of the {%Daśārha%} race (V, {@7@}).—§ 555: {%Śalya%} with his
sons and troops (description) was advancing in order to join
the {%Pāṇḍavas%}; but {%Duryodhana%} caused fine palaces of
entertainment to be constructed at different spots for his
reception; {%Śalya%} first thought this had been arranged by
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, until {%Duryodhana%} came forward and showed
himself; then he promised {%Duryodhana%} to become the
leader of his army. {%Śalya%}, however, first proceeded to the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} at {%Upaplavya%}, and told them about the matter.
He promised {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} that when he became {%Karṇa's%}
charioteer he would act so that {%Karṇa%} might be dispirited;
and in order to comfort {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} he reminded him that
{%Śakra (Indra%}) had to endure, together with his wife, very great
misery (V, {@8@}). At the request of {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Śalya%} related
the ancient story ({%itihāsaṃ purātanaṃ%}) of the great misery
endured by {%Indra%} and his queen (v. Indravijaya) (V, {@9—17@}).
So {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} should also regain his kingdom. This story
of the victory of {%Indra%}, equal to the {%Veda%}, should be listened to
by a king desirous of victory; he who reads it with a heart
full of religious faith is purified from his sins, etc. {%Śalya%}
repeated his promise to damp the spirits of {%Karṇa%}, and went
with his army to {%Duryodhana%} (V, {@18@}). {%Yuyudhāna%}, etc.
(γ) came to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} with troops (description). For the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} there were thus assembled seven {%akṣauhiṇīs%} of
troops from various directions. In the same way king
{%Bhagadatta%} (with an {%akṣauhiṇī%} crowded with {%Cīnas%} and
{%Kirātas%}), etc. (δ) came to the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%}. And thus
{%Duryodhana%} had a force which numbered eleven {%akṣauhiṇīs%},
so that there was no room for them in the city of {%Hāstinapura%};
but the {%Pañcanada%}, the whole {%Kurujāṅgala%}, etc. (ε), full of
ābundant corn and wealth, was entirely overspread with the
army of the {%Kauravas%}. And this army was beheld by
the {%purohita%} who had been sent by the {%Pāñcāla%} king to the
{%Kurus%} (V, {@19@}).
