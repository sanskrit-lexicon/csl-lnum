[{@Khaḍgotpattikathana(ṃ)@}]¦ (the narrative of the origin
of the sword). § 656 (cf. Āpaddh.): Nakula ({%b%}) questioned
Bhīṣma as to which (the sword or the bow) is really the
[Page405-a+ 63]
foremost of weapons, and how the sword was first created
and for what purpose, and who was the first instructor
in the use of that weapon. Bhīṣma related that in
ancient times the universe was one vast expanse of water,
enveloped in darkness, etc. There {%Pitāmaha%} (i.e. {%Brahmán%})
took his birth, he then created wind, fire, etc., and then
assuming a visible form he begot {%Marīci%}, etc. (α) [and
{%Pracetas%}; the last begot] {%Dakṣa (c%}). When {%Sarvaloka-%}
{%pitāmaha%} (i.e. {%Brahmán%}) had called into existence all
creatures he promulgated the eternal religion laid down
in the {%Vedas%}. That religion was accepted by the gods
with their preceptors and priests, and by Ā., V., R., S.,
M., A., {%Bhṛgu, Atri, Aṅgiras%}, Si., the {%Kāśyapas, Vasiṣṭha%},
etc. (β); all of them lived in obedience to {%Brahmán%}. But
the foremost of the {%Dānavas, Hiraṇyakaśipu%}, etc. (γ), and
many other {%Daityas%} and {%Dānavas%}, filled with wrath and
covetousness, took delight in all kinds of wicked acts, etc.,
wielding only the rod of chastisement; those foremost of
{%Asuras%} forsook every kindly intercourse with other creatures.
Then {%Brahmán%} with the {%Brahmarṣis%} proceeded to a delightful
summit of {%Himavat%}, and after 1,000 years he arranged a sacrifice.
From the sacrificial fire arose {%Asi%} (“the sword”) ({%d%}), which
{%Brahmán%} gave to {%Rudra%} (i.e. {%Śiva%}) in order to enable him to
put down irreligion. {%Rudra%} (description) with the sword
destroyed and dispersed the {%Asuras (Dānavas%}); some of them
penetrated into the bowels of the earth, others got under the
cover of the mountains, some went upwards, others entered
the depths of the sea. {%Rudra%} then gave the sword to {%Viṣṇu%},
{%Viṣṇu%} to {%Marīci, Marīci%} to the {%maharṣis%}, the {%maharṣis%} to
{%Vāsava%} (i.e. {%Indra%}), {%Mahendra%} (i.e. {%Indra%}) to the {%lokapālas%},
the {%lokapālas%} to {%Manu (e%}) the son of {%Sūrya%}. He gave it to
his son {%Kṣupa%}. Thence it passed successively to {%Ikṣvāku%},
etc. (δ), from {%Droṇa%} to {%Kṛpa%}, from {%Kṛpa%} to thee ({%Nakula%})
and thy brothers. {%Kṛttikāḥ%} is the {%nakṣatra%} of the sword,
{%Agni%} its deity, {%Rohiṇī%} its {%gotra, Rudra%} its high preceptor.
Its eight mysterious names are {%Asi%}, etc. (ε). Of all weapons
the sword is the foremost; the {%Purāṇas%} truly declare that it
was first wielded by {%Maheśvara%} (i.e. {%Śiva%}). {%Pṛthu (Vainya%})
({%f%}) created the first bow. Persons skilled in weapons should
always worship the sword. Blessing to the reader (XII, {@166@}).
