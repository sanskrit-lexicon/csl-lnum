{@Sagara@}<sup>1</sup>,¦ an ancient king of Ayodhyā. § 6 (Anukram.): I,
{@1@}α, 227 (in Sañjaya's enumeration).—§ 267 (Yamasabhāv.):
II, {@8@}, 330 (in the palace of Yama).—§ 339 (Indralokā-
bhigamanap.): III, {@47@}, 1897 ({%Kapilaḥ…yena pūrvaṃ%}
{%mahātmānaḥ khanamānā Rasātalaṃ | darśanād eva nihatāḥ%}
{%S°syātmajāḥ%}, all. to § 387).—§ 387 (Tīrthayātrāp.): At the
request of {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Lomaśa%} said: King {%S%}. of the family
of the {%Ikṣvākus%} had no sons. He subdued the {%Haihayas%} and
the {%Tālajaṅgḥas%}. His wives were {%Vaidarbhī%} and {%Śaibyā%}.
With them he on {%Kailāsa%} practised ascetic austerities in order
to obtain a son, and practising yoga he succeeded in seeing
{%Śiva%}, who said that owing to the {%muhūrta%} at which {%S%}. had
addressed his prayers to him, one of the wives of {%S%}. would
have 60,000 sons of exceeding pride, who should perish
altogether, and the other wife would have one valorous son,
who would perpetuate the race of {%S%}. Then {%Śiva%} disappeared
and {%S%}. and his wives went home. {%Vaidarbhī%} after some time
brought forth a gourd and {%Śaibyā%} a beautiful son. As {%S%}. was
about to throw away the gourd, a voice from the sky told him
[Page604-a+ 63]
to take out the seeds and preserve them in steaming vessels
partly filled with clarified butter, as they would become
60,000 sons (III, {@106@}). The {%rājarṣi S%}. did as he was told,
and provided a nurse for every receptacle. When they were
born their acts were ruthless, they were able to roam about
in the sky and harassed the gods, the {%Gandharvas%}, the
{%Rākṣasas%}, and all beings. The gods, etc., went to Brahmán,
who dismissed them saying that in a short time the sons
of {%S%}. would be destroyed. When after some time they
were protecting {%S.'s%} sacrificial horse who roamed over the
world, the horse suddenly disappeared when it had come to
the waterless sea. Having told {%S%}. that the horse had been
stolen, they were commanded to search for it, but they did
not find it. {%S%}. then filled with wrath forbade them to return
without the horse. They then began to dig the sea with
spades, etc., and killed {%Asuras, Uragas%} (snakes), {%Rākṣasas%},
and other beings by hundreds and thousands. After a long
time they dug down to {%Pātāla%} in the north-eastern region,
and seeing the horse there they ran after it without heeding
{%Kapila%} (“whom they say is Vāsudeva,” v. 8880), who was
present there. {%Kapila%} then burnt them to ashes. {%Nārada%}
told it to {%S.%}, who sent for {%Aṃśumat%}, the son of his son
{%Asamañjas%}, whom he had abandoned according to his duty
and for the good of the citizens: III, {@106@}, 8830, 8831
({%Ikṣvākūṇāṃ kule jātaḥ%}), 8841; {@107@}, 8859 ({%rājā%}), 8869
({%°ātmajāḥ%}), 8871 (do.), 8876 (do.), 8882 ({%°āntikaṃ%}).—§ 388
(Asamañjas): III, {@107@}, 8887, 8888 ({%Asamañjāḥ…S°sya%}
{%sutaḥ%}), 8890 (abandoned his son Asamañjas).—§ 389 (Gaṅgā-
vataraṇa): III, {@107@}, 8895, (8896), 8898, 9905, 9907, 9909,
9911, 9912 (asked by {%S.%}, Aṃśumat repaired to Kapila, who
granted him the horse and that his grandson should bring
the Gaṅgā down from heaven. {%S%}. made the ocean his son
and was succeeded on the throne by Aṃśumat); {@108@}, 9939
({%°ātmajān%}; Bhagīratha, the grandson of Aṃśumat, by the
favour of Mahādeva brought down the Gaṅgā, that she might
besprinkle the bodies of the sons of {%S%}.).—§ 478 (Dhundhu-
mārop.): III, {@204@}, 13609 ({%pureva Kapilaḥ…S°ātmajān%},
sc. {%adahat%}, all. to § 387).—§ 552 (Goharaṇap.): IV, {@56@}ζ,
1769 (came from heaven to see the encounter).—§ 565
(Gālavacarita): V, {@109@}, 3796 ({%vidur yaṃ Kapilaṃ devaṃ%}
{%yenārttāḥ Sagarātmajāḥ%}, all. to § 387).—§ 632{%b%} (Ṣoḍaśarāj.):
XII, {@29@}, 1023 ({%Aikṣvākuṃ%}): Also {%S%}. of Ikṣvāku's race
fell a prey to death. Sixty thousand sons walked behind
him. He performed 1,000 horse sacrifices and gave precious
gifts to the brahmans (description). Through anger he caused
the earth to be excavated, and thus she came to have the
ocean on her bosom, for this the ocean has come to be called
Sāgara after the name of {%S%}.—§ 640 (Rājadh.): XII, {@57@},
2054 ({%Bāhoḥ putreṇa…S°ena…Asamañjāḥ…%}
{%tyaktaḥ%}, all. to § 388).—§ 700 (Mokṣadh.): XII, {@289@},
10613 ({%itihāsaṃ purātanaṃ Ariṣṭaneminā proktaṃ S°āyānu—%}
{%pṛcchate%}), (10614) (instructed by Ariṣṭanemi).—§ 734
(Ānuśāsanik.): XIII, {@26@}, 1838 ({%putrān S°syeto bhaṣmākhyān%}
{%anayad divaṃ%}, sc. {%Gaṅgā%}, all. to § 389).—§ 761 (do.): XIII,
{@115@}δ, 5668 (did not eat meat during the month of Kārttika).
—§ 770 (do.): XIII, {@151@}, 7130 ({%Sagarasyātmajā%} (C. by
error {%Sā° jo%}) {%yena plāvitās tāritās tathā%}, sc. Bhagīratha, all.
to § 389. As stated under Śveta, PCR. before this inserts
a passage (omitted in both C. and B.), of which the last
śloka (mentioning Bhagīratha) ought to be connected with
this).—§ 775 (do.): XIII, {@166@}η, 7675 (C. has by error
{%Sā°%}).—§ 785 (Anugītāp.): XIV, {@87@}, 2594 ({%°ādayaḥ%}, had
not performed the horse sacrifice). Cf. Aikṣvāku.
