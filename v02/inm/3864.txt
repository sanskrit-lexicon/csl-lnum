{@Dyūtaparvan@}¦ (“the section relating to the gambling,” the
28th of the minor parvans of the Mhbhr.). § 10 (Parvas.):
I, {@2@}, 319.—§ 293: When {%Vyāsa%} with his disciples came
to take leave, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked him about the celestial,
atmospherical, and terrestrial portents which, according to
the statement of {%Nārada%}, had happened at the {%rājasūya%}.
{%Vyāsa%} said that in thirteen years they would be fulfilled by
the destruction of all the {%kṣatriyas%}, and that {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
would that very night see {%Śiva%} gazing incessantly towards
the direction presided over by the king of the {%Pitṛs%} (i.e. the
south). Then {%Vyāsa%} with his disciples proceeded towards
{%Kailāsa. Yudhiṣṭhira%} resolved to die in order that he might
not be the cause of the destruction of the {%kṣatriyas%}, but called
back from his intention by {%Phālguna%} (i.e. Arjuna), he took
upon him the vow not to speak a harsh word to his brothers
or to any of the kings. Then, having gratified the {%Pitṛs%} and
gods, he entered his own palace, accompanied by his ministers
(II, {@46@}).—§ 294: {%Duryodhana%}, accompanied by {%Śakuni%}, by
and by beheld all the {%sabhā%}; he mistook a piece of crystal
for water and drew off his clothes, mistook a lake for land
and fell in, etc., and was laughed at by {%Bhīma, Arjuna%}, the
twins, and the menials of the palace. Filled with wrath
and jealousy he became pale, and returned to {%Hāstinapura%},
together with {%Śakuni%} (II, {@47@}). {%Śakuni%} told him to ask
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, who was very fond of gambling and did not
know how to play, to play at dice; then he ({%Śakuni%}), who was
skilled in dice, would win his kingdom and prosperity for
{%Duryodhana%} (II, {@48@}). {%Śakuni%} told {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} that {%Duryo-%}
{%dhana%} was pale and depressed; {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} asked {%Duryodhana%}
the cause; {%Duryodhana%} told him that {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} supported
88,000 {%snātakas%}, giving to each of them thirty slave-girls; that
10,000 other brahmans daily ate at his palace the best food
off golden plates; that the king of {%Kāmboja%} sent to him
innumerable skins, etc.; that the Ocean brought the {%Vāruṇa%}
nectar to him in a vessel of copper, as the celestial wives
({%amarastriyaḥ%}) to {%Indra%}; that {%Vāsudeva%}, having brought an
excellent conch, bathed him with sea-water brought in 1,000
jars of gold, etc., from the eastern, southern, and western
oceans; that the conches, which were blown when 100,000
brahmans were fed, could be heard there almost incessantly,
etc. {%Duryodhana%} proposed to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} to invite {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%} to a game at dice with {%Śakuni%}, and prevented him
from consulting {%Vidura%} till he had had a {%sabhā%} built. Then
he ordered {%Vidura%}, who dissuaded him in vain, to invite
{%Yudhiṣṭhira. Vidura%} in great sorrow went to {%Bhīṣma%} (II,
{@49@}).—At the request of {%Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana%} related
that {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, having ascertained the opinion of {%Vidura%}
({%b%}), sought to bring {%Duryodhana%} back from his purpose to
play at dice; but {%Duryodhana%} would not give way, relating
that the {%Nīpas, Citrakas%}, the {%Kaukuras%}, the {%Kāraskaras%}, and
the {%Lohajaṅghas%} were like bondsmen in the house of {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%}, and that {%Bhīma, Arjuna%}, and {%Draupadī%} had laughed
at his mistake regarding the crystal, etc. (II, {@50@}).—§ 295:
{%Duryodhana%} enumerated to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} the articles brought
as tribute from various peoples to {%Yudhiṣṭhira. Yājñasenī%}
(i.e. Kṛṣṇā) daily (during the {%rājasūya%}) took care that
everybody, including the deformed and the dwarfs, had eaten
[Page283-b+ 63]
before she herself took her meal. Only two peoples did not
pay tribute to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, the {%Pāñcālas%}, in consequence of
their relationship by marriage, and the {%Andhaka-Vṛṣṇis%},
in consequence of their friendship (II, {@52@}).—§ 296: {%Duryo-%}
{%dhana%} continued to enumerate kings, etc., who waited
upon {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} at the {%rājasūya%}. The Ocean brought that
{%Vāruṇa%} conch ({%śaikyaṃ%}, “in a sling,” PCR., i.e. in a strap,
cf. BR.), which {%Viśvakarman%} had constructed with 1,000
{%niṣkas%}, and which {%Prajāpati%} had in a former {%kalpa%} presented
to {%Indra%}; with that conch {%Kṛṣṇa%} anointed ({%abhiṣiktaḥ%})
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%}. When the conches were blown, those among
the kings who were weak fell down, and {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%},
{%Sātyaki%}, the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, and {%Keśava%} laughed; then {%Bībhatsu%}
(= Arjuna) gave to the principal brahmans 500 bullocks
with horns plated with gold, and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} obtained, like
{%Hariścandra%}, such properity that he surpassed {%Rantideva%},
{%Nābhāga, Yauvanāśva, Manu, Pṛthu Vainya, Bhagīratha, Yayāti%},
and {%Nahuṣa%} (II, {@53@}).—§ 297: Continuation of the con-
versation between {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} and {%Duryodhana%} (II, {@54, 55@}).
—§ 298: As {%Śakuni%} recommended the match of dice and
praised his own dexterity in gambling, and {%Duryodhana%} spoke
reprovingly of {%Vidura%} on account of his fondness for the
{%Pāṇḍavas%}, etc., {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} reluctantly caused the {%sabhā%}
(called {%Toraṇasphāṭikā%}) to be built, with 1,000 columns
adorned with gold and lapis lazuli, a {%krośa%} in length and
breadth, and then ordered {%Vidura%} to bring {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and
his brothers (II, {@56, 57@}). {%Vidura%} arrived at the palace
of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and invited him. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, having
learned that he should have to play with {%Śakuni,-Viviṃśati%},
{%Citrasena, Satyavrata, Purumitra%}, and {%Jaya%}, “the most
desperate and terrible gamblers, always depending upon
deceit,” was unwilling to come; but as he had made the vow
never to refuse when challenged, he set out for {%Hāstinapura%}
the next day with his relatives, {%Draupadī%}, brahmans, etc.,
riding on the chariot taken charge of (so BR.) by {%Bāhlīka%},
and when he had arrived he saluted {%Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Karṇa%},
{%Kṛpa, Aśvatthāman, Somadatta, Duryodhana, Śalya, Saubala%},
{%Duḥśāsana, Jayadratha%}, etc., and {%Gāndhārī%} and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
(II, {@58@}). {%Śakuni%} exhorted {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to gamble. {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%} quoted {%Asita Devala (b%}), but he was obliged to assent;
{%Duryodhana%} said that he himself would supply jewels, etc.,
and that it was for him that {%Śakuni%} would play (II, {@59@}).
The play began, the stake being a wreath of pearls, which
{%Śakuni%} won (II, {@60@}). {%Śakuni%} then won from {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
his treasury, slave-girls, serving-men, elephants, chariots,
the {%Gandharva%} horses which {%Citrasena%} had given to {%Arjuna%},
his warriors, and {%nidhis%} (II, {@61@}). {%Vidura%}, addressing {%Dhṛta-%}
{%rāṣtṛa%}, quoted the words of {%Kāvya%}, and reminded him
that among the {%Bhojas%} they had abandoned an unworthy
({%asamañjasaṃ%}) son; the {%Andhakas, Yādavas%}, and {%Bhojas%} had
abandoned {%Kaṃsa%}, and when he had been slain by {%Kṛṣṇa%}
the whole tribe became glad for a hundred years;
“[likewise] let {%Arjuna%} slay this {%Suyodhana%} at thy command”;
he quoted what {%Kāvya%} said to the {%Asuras%} in order to
induce them to abandon {%Jambha%}, and related how a king
from greediness after gold killed some gold-vomiting fowls
that dwelt in his house, and so destroyed both his present
and future wealth (II, {@62@}). {%Vidura%} warned against the
gambling, and suggested to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} rather to win the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} than their wealth, and to let {%Śakuni%}, the hill-king
({%Pārvatīyaḥ%}), return whence he came (II, {@63@}). {%Duryodhana%}
blamed {%Vidura%} for his partiality towards the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, and
said that he would only follow the advice of his own intellect.
[Page284-a+ 63]
{%Vidura%} complained of the ingratitude of kings and their
fondness of flattery (II, {@64@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} lost his wealth,
kine, horses, goats, and sheep, “from {%Parṇāśā%} to the eastern
bank of the {%Sindhu%},” his city, country, lands, and the wealth
of all dwelling therein, except that of the brahmans, and all
those persons themselves except the brahmans, the ear-rings and
{%niṣkas%} and other ornaments of the princes who were present,
then {%Nakula, Sahadeva, Arjuna, Bhīma%}, himself, and {%Draupadī%};
now {%Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Kṛpa, Vidura%}, etc., all gave way to
grief, but {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Karṇa, Duḥśāsana%}, etc., were glad
(II, {@65@}).—§ 299: {%Duryodhana%} ordered {%Kṣattṛ%} (i.e. {%Vidura%})
to bring hither {%Draupadī%} to sweep the chambers and stay
with the servant maids; {%Vidura%} declared that having lost
himself, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} could not lawfully stake {%Draupadī%}, and
said: “A goat had once swallowed a knife, and when it was
pierced by it the hunter placed the head of the animal on the
ground, and when drawing the knife out he tore its throat
frightfully; therefore do not swallow the wealth of the
{%Pāṇḍavas%}” (II, {@66@}). Then {%Duryodhana%} ordered the {%prā-%}
{%tikāmin%} (a {%sūta%}) to bring {%Draupadī%}; she ordered him to ask
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} whether he had lost himself or her first; as
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} said nothing, {%Duryodhana%} ordered that {%Draupadī%}
should come and put her question in the assembly; she sent
the {%sūta%} back to the assembly saying that she would do what
aged and virtuous persons would tell her; all sat without
uttering a word; but {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} sent a trusted messenger
to {%Draupadī%}, directing that, although in consequence of her
season having come she was attired in one piece of cloth only.
she should come before her father-in-law weeping bitterly.
{%Duryodhana%} again ordered the {%prātikāmin%} to bring her, and
as he seemed irresolute, he asked {%Duḥśāsana%} to do so. As
she would flee to the ladies' household, {%Duḥśāsana%} dragged
her in by her hair, while she was praying to {%Kṛṣṇa%} and
{%Jiṣṇu%} (i.e. {%Arjuna%}), who were {%Nārāyaṇa%} and {%Nara%}, and
blaming {%Droṇa, Bhīṣma, Vidura%}, etc., for looking silently on
this crime. As she was casting a glance upon her enraged
lords, {%Duḥśāsana%}, dragging her still more forcibly, addressed
her, “Slave! slave!” and laughed aloud, applauded by
{%Karṇa, Śakuni%}, and {%Duryodhana%}, while all the others were
filled with sorrow. {%Bhīṣma%} declared himself to be unable to
decide the question she had put. As she then asked the
others present to decide it, {%Duḥśāsana%} spoke many harsh words,
and {%Bhīma%}, looking at {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, gave way to wrath (II,
{@67@}). {%Bhīma%} blamed {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, and ordered {%Sahadeva%} to
bring fire, as he wanted to burn the hands of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, but
{%Arjuna%} appeased him. {%Vikarṇa%} repeatedly appealed to those
present to decide the question, and as they did not say one
word, he declared that as {%Yudhiṣṭhīra%} must be regarded as of
no authority, because he had shown himself addicted to the
vice of gambling, etc., he regarded {%Draupadī%} as not won. All
applauded him, except {%Karṇa%}, who maintained that she had
been justly won, and as, contrary to the ordinance of the
gods that a woman should have only one husband, she had
five husbands, there was no impropriety in dragging her to
the assembly, and even to uncover her. {%Karṇa%} then asked
{%Duḥśāsana%} to take off the robes of the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and the attire
of {%Draupadī%}. The {%Pāṇḍavas%} took off their upper garments,
and {%Duḥśāsana%} began to drag off the attire of {%Draupadī%}.
But as she thought of and cried to {%Hari%} (i.e. {%Kṛṣṇa%}), {%Dharma%}
continually covered her anew with excellent clothes. {%Bhīma%}
swore that he would drink the blood of {%Duḥśāsana%}. All
blamed {%Duḥśāsana%} and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Vidura%} exhorted the
assembly to answer the question put by {%Draupadī%}, and related
[Page284-b+ 57]
the dialogue of {%Prahlāda%} (q.v.) and {%Āṅgirasa%} (i.e. {%Sudhanvan%})
(§ 300).—§ 300: v. {%Prahlāda%}.—§ 301: The kings answered
not a word, and {%Karṇa%} told {%Duḥśāsana%} to take away the
slave-woman {%Kṛṣṇā%} to the inner apartments (II, {@68@}).
Dragged by {%Duḥśāsana, Draupadī%} saluted the assembly,
complained of being exposed to the gaze of the crowd, and
again asked them to answer her question. {%Bhīṣma%} again
declared himself unable to decide it, but thought {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
ought to decide it (II, {@69@}). {%Duryodhana%} said to {%Draupadī%}:
“Let thy husbands decide the question, and, by making
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} the just a liar, free thee from slavery.” {%Bhīma%}
said that only his obedience to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and the admoni-
tions of {%Arjuna%} retained him from killing the wretched sons
of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Bhīṣma, Droṇa%}, and {%Vidura%} asked him to
forbear (II, {@70@}). {%Karṇa%} exhorted {%Draupadī%} to choose a new
husband among the sons of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, and {%Duryodhana%},
after having exhorted {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to decide the question,
uncovered his left thigh and showed it to {%Draupadī. Bhīṣma%}
swore that he would break this thigh of his. {%Vidura%} warned
them, and was of opinion that {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} had no right to
stake her. {%Duryodhana%} said that if {%Bhīma, Arjuna%}, and the
twins declared that {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} was not their master, then
{%Draupadī%} should be free. {%Arjuna%} said that he was certainly
their master before the play, “but having lost himself, let all
the {%Kauravas%} judge whose master he could be after that.”
Just then a jackal began to cry near the {%agnihotra%} of {%Dhṛta-%}
{%rāṣṭra%}, and other terrible omens were heard. On that account
{%Gāndhārī%} and {%Vidura%} remonstrated with {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, who
blamed {%Duryodhana%} and granted a boon to {%Kṛṣṇā%}. She chose
that {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} should become free from slavery. As she was
granted a second boon, she asked that {%Bhīma%} and his brothers
with their chariots and bows should regain their liberty.
She refused to ask a third boon (II, {@71@}). {%Karṇa%} praised
{%Draupadī%} for having saved her husbands. {%Bhīma%} threatened
to slay all his foes instantly, but was retained by {%Arjuna%}
and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (II, {@72@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} sent {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
with his brothers and {%Kṛṣṇā%} upon their chariots to {%Indra-%}
{%prastha%}, having asked him not to remember the harshness of
{%Duryodhana%} (II, {@73@}).
