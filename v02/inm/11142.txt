[{@Umā-Maheśvara-saṃvāda@}]¦ (“the discourse between
Umā and Śiva”). § 768{%b%} (Ānuśāsanik.): {%Nārada%} said:
Once, {%Śiva%} on {%Himavat%}, the resort of Si. and Cā., practised
severe penances, surrounded by Aps., etc. (α) (copious
descriptions). Then came {%Umā%} (description) and with her
hands covered the eyes of {%Śiva%} from behind, and darkness
arose all around; but suddenly the darkness disappeared:
a third eye appeared on his forehead and consumed the
mountain; {%Umā%} stood before him with her hands joined; he
directed benignant looks towards the mountain, which, in a
moment, was restored to its former condition. {%Umā%} asked why
his eastern, northern, and western faces are so handsome, and
the southern so terrible (1); why his matted locks are tawny
and erect (2); why his throat is blue (3); why he has always
the {%Pināka%} in his hand (4); why he is always a {%brahmacārin%}
with matted locks (5). {%Śiva%} promised to explain it to her
(XIII, {@140@}). {%Śiva%} answered the above questions (1): “In
days of yore {%Tilottamā%}, created by {%Brahmán%} (cf. I, ch. {@211@}),
circumambulated me; in whatever direction she turned, a
new face of mine appeared through my {%yoga-%}power; with my
eastern face I exercise the sovereignty of the universe; with
my northern I sport with thee (i.e. {%Umā%}); with my western
I ordain the happiness of creatures; with my southern
I destroy all creatures. (2 and 5): In order to do good to
all creatures. (3): In days of yore, {%Indra%}, desirous of
acquiring my prosperity hurled his thunderbolt at me, which
scorched my throat. (4): In order to accomplish the purposes
of the gods.” {%Umā%}: Why hast thou selected a bull for thy
vehicle? {%Śiva%}: In days of yore, {%Brahmán%} created {%Surabhi%}
(the celestial cow); once, froth fell from one of her calves on
my body; my wrath scorched all the kine which became
diversified in hue; {%Brahmán%} pacified me and gave me this
bull both as a vehicle and as a device. {%Umā%}: Why dost
thou reside in the cemetery (description), abandoning thy
many abodes in heaven? {%Śiva%}: I do not see any spot that
is more sacred than the cemetery, and my {%Bhūtas%} love to
reside in such spots. {%Umā%}: What are the indications of
{%dharma? Śiva%}: Abstention from injury, etc. {%Umā%}: What
are the duties of the four castes? {%Śiva%} enumerated them.
{%Umā%}: What are the common duties of all the castes?
{%Śiva%}: Whenever the world is created, three eternal religions
are created by {%Brahmán%}: the {%Veda%}, the {%smṛti%}, and the
practice of the righteous, etc.; there are four classes of
{%bhikṣus: kuṭīcaka, bahūdaka, haṃsa%}, and {%paramahaṃsa%} (each
in turn being superior to the preceding one; v. Nīl.). {%Umā%}:
What is the religion of the {%ṛṣis (munis)? Śiva%}: (1) the
{%Phenapas%} always gather the froth from the {%amṛta%} that
{%Brahmán%} drank at a great sacrifice. (2) The {%Vālakhilyas%}
in the solar disc, adopting the practice of the birds, live by
picking up grains ({%uñche%}), clad in deer-skins or bark of trees;
they are only as big as the joint of the thumb; they have
burnt all their sins by severe penances. (3) The {%Cakracaras%}
in the {%Somaloka%}, near to {%Pitṛloka%}, live by gleaning [differently
[Page690-b+ 63]
Nīl.], devoted to compassion. (4) The {%Samprakṣālas%},
{%Aśmakuṭṭas%}, and {%Dantolūkhalikas%} [v. Nīl. and the note of
PCR., p. 642], near the gods [called] {%Somapas%} and {%Ūṣmapas%}
(C. {%U°%}), live by gleaning [“drinking the rays of {%Soma%},”
PCR.], together with their wives, etc. ({%Śiva%} copiously
described the religion of the Ṛ. in general) (XIII, {@141@}).
{%Umā%}: What is the religion of the {%Vānaprasthas? Śiva%}
described it ({%vīrāsana, maṇḍūka-yoga, paurṇamāsya, cāturmāsya%},
etc.); they attain to {%Brahmaloka%} or {%Somaloka. Umā%}: What
is the religion of the {%munis (munisaṅghasya%}) in their
doctrines of perfection ({%siddhivādeṣu%}; i.e. {%jñānagoṣṭhīṣu%},
Nīl.; “followers of the scriptures treating of ascetic success,”
PCR.)? they live unrestrained in the forest, together with their
wives. {%Śiva%}: Their characteristics are the shaving of the
head, yellow robes, passing the night at home, ablutions
three times a day, {%hotra, samādhi%}, adherence to the path of
the good, etc. All those duties of which I have spoken
before as belonging to forest-recluses, are the duties of these
also, etc. (copious description). Asked by {%Umā, Śiva%} said:
By fasts, etc., one attains to heaven and sports with G.; by
{%maṇḍūkayoga%} and {%dīkṣā%} with the {%Nāgas%}; by living with
deer, etc., one attains to {%Amarāvatī%}; by subsisting upon air
or water, fruits and roots, one attains to the riches of Y. and
sports with Aps.; by abandoning one's body in the ocean,
having lived in dependence only of himself, etc., one attains
to the world of {%Varuṇa%}; by the same practices and piercing
one's feet with a stone, one rejoices with the Gh., others obtain
{%Brahmaloka%} (having abandoned their bodies in fire as an
oblation to the gods), {%Śakraloka%}, etc. (XIII, {@142@}). Asked
by {%Umā, Śiva%} expounded the circumstances under which one
may be promoted or degraded to a higher or lower order when
reborn (XIII, {@143@}). Asked by {%Umā, Śiva%} (worshipped by
D. and As.) discoursed as to how men succeed in ascending to
heaven, and what words, thoughts, and acts are of importance
in this respect and for acquiring a long life. “This is the
way that was indicated by {%Brahmán%} himself” (XIII, {@144@}).
Asked by {%Umā, Śiva%} discoursed about that conduct by which
a man may attain to heaven (Aps., the woods of {%Nandana%}),
quoting {%Brahmán%}; the unmerciful, etc., sink into hell; they
who humiliate their preceptors and seniors are reborn as
{%Śvapākas%} and {%Pukkasas%}. Then (asked by {%Umā%}) he explained
why some men become possessed of wisdom or the contrary,
blind, diseased, etc.; what acts are faulty, and what faultless;
why some are observant of vows, some like Rā. ({%Brahma-%}
{%rākṣasas%}) in conduct, unmindful of {%homa%} and {%vaṣaṭkāra%}
(XIII, {@145@}). {%Nārada%} said: Now {%Śiva%} himself became
desirous of hearing. Saying that {%Umā%} (acquainted with all
duties, etc.) used to converse every day with {%Sāvitrī%}, etc.
(γ), who all regard their husbands as their gods, he questioned
{%Umā%} about the duties of women; “half of my body is made
up of half thy body; thon…art the cause of the peopling of
the earth.” {%Umā%} said she would first consult the rivers,
who, with the waters of all {%tīrthas%}, are approaching {%Śiva%} in
order to enable him to perform his ablutions: {%Sarasvatī%} (the
first of all streams), going to the ocean, etc. (δ). {%Gaṅgā%} was
selected for answering the question, and praised {%Umā's%}
modesty; then {%Umā%} discoursed upon the duties of women in
full. She should not cast her eyes on the moon or the sun
or a tree that has a masculine name. The husband is the
god of the woman. If a husband being poor, or diseased,
or distressed, etc., were to command his wife to accomplish
anything improper or unrighteous, the wife should, without
hesitation, do so according to the practice allowable in
[Page691-a+ 63]
time of distress, and she becomes entitled to a share in the
merit acquired by her husband. {%Nārada%} said: {%Śiva%} applauded
{%Umā%} and dismissed the others; Bh., etc. (ε), returned home
(XIII, {@146@}). Asked by Ṛ., {%Śiva%} discoursed on the glory of
{%Vāsudeva%}, i.e. Kṛṣṇa, q.v. (XIII, {@147@}). {%Nārada%} said: At
the conclusion of {%Śiva's%} speech loud roars were heard in the
firmament, etc. Some of Ṛ. set out on a {%tīrthayātrā%}, others
returned whence they came.
