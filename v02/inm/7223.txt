{@Matsya@}<sup>1</sup>,¦ a king, son of Vasu Uparicara. § 76 (cf. Ādivaṃśā-
vatāraṇa): When {%Girikā's%} season came, the pitṛs of {%Vasu%}
(q.v.) asked him to slay deer; when he in the forest was
longing for {%Girikā%}, he gave his semen, enveloped by an
aśoka leaf, to a hawk in order that it should be carried
to {%Girikā%}; persecuted by another hawk, the hawk let the
semen fall into the {%Yamunā%}, where it was swallowed by
the Apsaras {%Adrikā%}, who had by the curse of a brahman
been transformed into a fish. In the tenth month the fish
was caught, and out of its womb came a boy, who was
given to {%Uparicara%} and afterwards became the king {%Matsya%},
and a girl, {%Satyavatī%}, who was of a fishy smell, and was
retained by the fisherman. When killed, {%Adrikā%} assumed
her own celestial shape and went away to the regions of the
{%Siddhas%}, the {%Ṛṣis%}, and the {%Cāraṇas%}: I, {@63@}, 2393 ({%rājā%}).—
§ 267 (Yamasabhāv.): II, {@8@}, 320 (in the palace of Yama).
