lasabhākhyānap.): {%H%}. is the only king who lives in the
palace of Indra, and the reason is that {%H%}. had formerly
brought the whole earth with its seven islands under his
sway, and had performed the {%rājasūya%} sacrifice, to which all
the kings of the earth brought wealth at his command, and
having concluded the {%rājasūya%}, he was installed in the
sovereignty of the earth ({%sāmrājyena%}). All princes who
perform a {%rājasūya%} or are slain in battle without turning their
