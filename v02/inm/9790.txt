[{@Saugandhikāharaṇaṃ@}]¦ (“the bringing of the fragrant
lotuses”; cf. Tīrthayātrāp.). § 431: When {%Bhīma%} was
embraced by {%Hanumat%} his fatigue went off. {%Hanumat%} asked
him not to tell anyone that he dwelt there; this was the
time of the arrival of the gods and of the {%Gandharvas%}
(cf. v. 11220); he declared himself willing if {%Bhīma%} might
wish it to go to {%Hāstinapura%} and slay the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%},
etc., and dive into the army of his foes, giving leonine roars
and remaining on the flagstaff of {%Arjuna's%} chariot. Then
{%Hanumat%} vanished (III, {@151@}).—§ 432: Description of the
proceeding of {%Bhīma%} along the {%Gandhamādana%} till he found
the lotuses (III, {@152@}). Description of the lotus-lake, near
{%Kailāsa%}, guarded by hundreds of thousands of {%Rākṣasas%}
(called {%Krodhavaśāḥ%}), sprung from a cascade near the abode
of {%Kubera%}, the sporting place of {%Kubera%}, frequented by
{%Gandharvas, Apsarases%}, gods, divine {%ṛṣis, Yakṣas, Kimpuru-%}
{%ṣas, Rākṣasas%}, and {%Kinnaras. Bhīma%} drank of the water
(III, {@153@}). The {%Krodhavaśas%} ordered {%Bhīma%} to ask the
permission of {%Kubera%} before he entered the lake; but {%Bhīma%}
plunged into the water, and as the {%Rākṣasas%} attacked him,
he slew 100 of them with his mace, inlaid with golden
plates, and then drank of the water, by which his strength
was fully restored, and gathered {%saugandhika%}-lotuses, while
the {%Krodhavaśas%} fled through the sky to the peaks of {%Kailāsa%}
and gave account to {%Kubera%}, who said: “Let {%Bhīma%} take as
many lotuses as he likes.” The {%Rākṣasas%} then returned to
{%Bhīma%} (III, {@154@}).—§ 433: As there arose a violent wind
with gravel, meteors, thunder, darkness, earthquake, dust,
and evil omens, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, having learned from {%Kṛṣṇā%}
the depart of {%Bhīma%}, and alleging that {%Bhīma%} had not
formerly done any wrong to the {%Siddhas%} ({%siddhānāṃ brahma-%}
{%vādināṃ%}, v. 11415), resolved to find out {%Bhīma%} and let
{%Ghaṭotkaca%} carry {%Kṛṣṇā%}, while other {%Rākṣasas%} carried the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} and the brahmans, and so they proceeded with
{%Lomaśa%} to the lake, where the slaughtered {%Yakṣas%} were
lying, and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} entreated {%Bhīma%} never again to
offend the gods; the {%Pāṇḍavas%} began to sport in the lake,
and the warders (i.e. the Rākṣasas), with rocks for weapons,
bowed down in humility. There they dwelt for a short time
on the slopes of {%Gandhamādana%}, expecting {%Arjuna%} (III, {@155@}).
—§ 434: One day when {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, remembering the
tīrthas, rivers ({%Ilā%}, etc.), etc., that they had visited, consulted
with {%Bhīma%} how they should repair to the abode of
{%Vaiśravaṇa (b%}), a voice from the sky said that they must
first return to {%Badarī%} and thence to the hermitage of
{%Vṛṣaparvan(c%}) and that of {%Ārṣṭiṣeṇa%}. There came a shower
of blossoms. According to the counsel of {%Dhaumya%}, they
all returned to the hermitage of {%Nara%} and {%Nārāyaṇa%}
(III, {@156@}).
