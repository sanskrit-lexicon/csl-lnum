[{@Aṣṭāvakra-Dik-saṃvāda(ḥ)@}]¦ (“discourse between
Aṣṭāvakra and the goddess of the North”). § 731{%b%}
(Ānuśāsanik.): XIII, {@19@} ff.: {%Bhīṣma%} said: In days of
yore {%Aṣṭāvakra%} (of severe penances) asked Ṛ. {%Vadānya%} for
his beautiful daughter {%Suprabhā. Vadānya%} first caused him to
make a journey to the North, indicating the road: (1) {%Himavat%}
(peopled by Si. and Cā.); (2) the sacred river {%Bāhudā%},
where he bathed in one of the {%tīrthas%}, etc. (description),
and worshipped {%Rudra%} and {%Umā%}; (3) {%Kailāsa%}, where he saw
a golden gate, etc. (α), and was honoured by {%Kubera%} among
Y. (with {%Maṇibhadra%}), G., and K., and where Aps. (β) danced;
there he remained a celestial year; (4) having crossed
{%Kailāsa%} and {%Mandara%} as also the golden mountains, he came
to the region where {%Mahādeva%} resides attired as an ascetic,
{%Pārṣadas%} of which are frolicsome and fond of dance and
possessed of faces of diverse forms, which was peopled by Si.,
Cā., and Pc., where {%Umā%} had practised austerities for the sake
of [obtaining] {%Śiva%}; where, in days of yore, on the {%Mahāpārśva%}
[mountain] (to the north of the god) the Seasons, etc. (αʹ),
in their material forms had adored {%Mahādeva%}; (5) a beautiful
forest (description), where the river {%Mandākinī%} was seen,
with an old and decrepit female ascetic (with many beautiful
maidens), who in vain tempted him with love (XIII, {@19@}),
at last appearing in a beautiful form (XIII, {@20@}). She
turned out to be the goddess of the North ({%Uttarāṃ diśaṃ%}),
who, having been gratified by Ṛ. {%Vadānya%}, had devised this
trial and now instructed him, showing him the levity of
women, even when aged; “thou hast subjugated all the
worlds by thy strength of mind; thy journey back will not
be irksome thou wilt obtain the wife thou hast chosen;
[Page093-b+ 63]
she will bear thee a son.” {%Aṣṭāvakra%} came back to his
own abode, and then to {%Vadānya%}, who wedded him to the
girl. There he continued to dwell joyously in his own
hermitage (XIII, {@21@}).
