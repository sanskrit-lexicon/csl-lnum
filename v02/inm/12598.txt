[{@Yavakrītopākhyana(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode relating to
Yavakrīta”). § 414 (Tīrthay.). The learned {%Raibhya%} and
the Ṛṣi {%Bharadvāja%} were friends. {%Raibhya%} had two learned
sons, {%Arvāvasu%} and {%Parāvasu; Bharadvāja%} only one son,
{%Yavakrīta%}. As {%Yavakrīta%} saw that {%Raibhya%} and his sons
were esteemed by the {%brahmans%}, while {%Bharadvāja%} was
slighted, he practised austerities (exposing himself to a
blazing fire) in order to acquire Vedic knowledge for himself
and his father (cf. v. 10817) instead of acquiring it from a
teacher during a long time. {%Indra%} was alarmed, and twice
he in vain attempted to make {%Yavakrīta%} desist from his
penances, saying that they never could be successful. As
{%Yavakrīta%} declared that he would cut off his limbs and
sacrifice them in the fire, {%Indra%} assumed the guise of an old
decrepit brahman, and began to throw up a dam of sand at
that spot of the {%Bhāgīrathī%} where {%Yavakrīta%} used to bathe,
and declared that {%Yavakrīta's%} intentions were equally im-
possible. Then {%Yavakrīta%} desisted from his plan, and {%Indra%}
granted him that the {%Vedas%} should be revealed to him and
his father, and that he should excel other men. {%Bharadvāja%}
said that {%Yavakrīta%} would become proud and uncharitable
and thence destruction would soon overtake him (§ 415), and
told him some gāthās, narrated by the gods, about {%Medhāvin%}
(q.v.).—§ 416. {%Bharadvāja%} made {%Yavakrīta%} promise to shun
the irritable {%Raibhya%} and his sons, and {%Yavakrīta%} began to
offend other {%ṛṣis%} (III, {@135@}). Once, in the month of
{%Mādhava%}, he came to the hermitage of {%Raibhya%} and seduced (?)
(cf. {%sajjayām āsa%}, var. lect. Nīl., instead of {%majjayām āsa%}) the
wife of {%Parāvasu%}. When {%Raibhya%} came home and saw what
had happened, he offered in the fire two matted locks of his
hair, whence sprang out a woman resembling his daughter-
in-law, who robbed {%Yavakrīta%} of his water-pot, and a {%Rakṣas%},
who flew at him with his uplifted spear, as he had been
deprived of his water-pot and rendered unclean ({%ucchiṣṭa%}).
{%Yavakrīta%} fled to a tank and then to all the rivers, and,
finding them all devoid of water, he attempted to enter into
the {%agnihotra%} room of his father, but was stopped at the door
by a blind {%śūdra%} warder, and killed by the {%rakṣas%}. The
{%Rakṣas%}, with the permission of {%Raibhya%}, began to live with
the female (III, {@136@}). When {%Bharadvāja%} returned home,
the sacrificial fires, which used to welcome him every day,
did not come forward to welcome him. Having heard from
the {%śūdra%} what had happened, he cursed {%Raibhya%}, saying
that he should be killed by his eldest son. He cremated
{%Yavakrīta%}, and then himself entered the fire (III, {@137@}).
At that time king {%Bṛhaddyumna%}, the {%yājya%} of {%Raibhya%},
employed {%Arvāvasu%} and {%Parāvasu%} at a sacrifice, while
{%Raibhya%} stayed at home with the wife of {%Parāvasu%}. One
day {%Parāvasu%}, returning home to see his wife, met in the
[Page773-a+ 63]
darkness his father in the wood wrapped in the skin of a
black antelope, and, mistaking him for a deer, killed him.
Then, after having performed the funeral rites of his father,
he prevailed upon {%Arvāvasu%} to observe the vow prescribed in
the case of killing a brahman, while he himself conducted
the sacrifice alone. When {%Arvāvasu%} came back, having
observed the vow, {%Parāvasu%} caused him to be driven away
from the sacrifice as a slayer of a brahman. The {%brahmarṣi%}
{%Arvāvasu%} went to the wood, and, applying to the Sun, he
practised austerities and mastered the {%Rahasyaveda%} of the
Sun. The Sun appeared to him in his embodied form, and
said the gods were pleased by him. They elected {%Arvāvasu%}
and rejected {%Parāvasu%}. The gods {%Agni%}, etc., granted him the
boon that {%Raibhya, Bharadvāja%}, and {%Yavakrīta%} revived, that
{%Parāvasu%} was absolved from his sin, that {%Raibhya%} did not
recollect his having been slain, and that the {%Saura Veda%}
should attain celebrity ({%pratiṣṭhāṃ%}). The gods explained to
{%Yavakrīta%} that {%Raibhya%} had been able to kill him because he
had acquired his knowledge with great exertion and in the
course of a long time, while {%Yavakrīta%} had learnt the {%Vedas%}
without exertion and without a {%guru%}. Then {%Indra%} and the
gods returned to heaven (III, {@138@}).
