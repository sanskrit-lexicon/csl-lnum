worshipping {%Kumāra%}. He said that he was as well versed
in military affairs as {%Bṛhaspati%}, etc. At the request of
{%Duryodhana%} he enumerated the principal {%rathas%} and {%atirathas%}
in {%Duryodhana's%} army (α) (V, {@165@}); continuation (V, {@166@});
continuation (V, {@167@}); {%Karṇa%} he considered only half
a {%ratha%}, at which {%Karṇa%} was enraged, and said he would
not fight before {%Bhīṣma%} was slain. {%Bhīṣma%} rebuked him,
but was pacified by {%Duryodhana%} (V, {@168@}). At the request
of {%Duryodhana, Bhīṣma%} enumerated the {%rathas%} and {%atirathas%}
of the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (β) (V, {@169@}). Continuation (V, {@170@}).
Continuation (V, {@171@}). Continuation. {%Bhīṣma%} would not
slay {%Śikhaṇḍin%} (mentioning the time when {%Vicitravīrya%} was
installed {%yuvarāja%}, and his own vow not to slay a woman or
one who had been a woman), for {%Śikhaṇḍin%} was formerly
a woman; nor would he be able to slay the sons of {%Kuntī%}
(V, {@172@}).
