[{@Droṇavadhaparvan@}]¦ (“the section including the
slaughter of Droṇa,” the 77th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.;
cf. Droṇavadha). § 601: CONTINUATION OF THE NIGHT AFTER
THE FOURTEENTH DAY: According to the words of {%Vyāsa%},
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} refrained from himself seeking to slay {%Karṇa%},
but was filled with grief and anger because {%Karṇa%} had slain
{%Ghaṭotkaca%}. Beholding the {%Kurus%} held in check by {%Bhīma%},
he told {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, etc. (α), to attack {%Droṇa%}, who received
them; {%Duryodhana%}, etc., came to {%Droṇa's%} rescue; a fierce
battle ensued between the two hosts; both armies became
sorely afflicted with fatigue and blind with sleep. {%Arjuna%}
granted permission to the warriors to sleep. D., Ṛ., and the
soldiers applauded {%Arjuna%}; the {%Kurus%} asked {%Karṇa%} and
{%Duryodhana%} to abstain from the fight; all the combatants
laid themselves down on the field to sleep (description); the
{%Kaurava%} troops blessed {%Arjuna%} for his act of kindness. When
the moon rose, both hosts, rising from sleep, again prepared
for battle (VII, {@184@}). {%Duryodhana%} taxed {%Droṇa%} wrathfully
for his kindness to the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (β); {%Droṇa%} in wrath promised
to slay all the {%Pāñcālas%}, and described the measure of {%Arjuna's%}
might and prowess (γ). {%Duryodhana%} vowed that he, etc. (δ),
that very day would slay {%Arjuna%}, dividing the {%Bharata%} host into
two divisions. {%Droṇa%} ridiculed {%Duryodhana%} (ε), saying that
it was only right that {%Duryodhana%} or {%Śakuni%}, who were the
root of the hostility, should proceed against {%Arjuna%}, instead
of causing all the unoffending {%Kṣatriyas%} to be slain, and
that he should accomplish his boasting vow before {%Dhṛta-%}
{%rāṣṭra%}, and that he and {%Karṇa%} and {%Duḥśāsana%} would slay the
{%Pāṇḍavas%}; moreover, he had done all in life that one should
do. The army then was divided into two bodies, and the
battle commenced (VII, {@185@}).—§ 602: THE FIFTEENTH
DAY: When three-quarters of that night had worn away,
the battle once more commenced. At sunrise both hosts,
alighting from their chariots, etc., uttered the prayers of the
twilight. After the {%Kuru%} army had been divided into two
bodies, {%Droṇa%}, with {%Duryodhana%} before him, proceeded against
the {%Somakas%}, the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, and the {%Pāñcālas%}. Urged by
{%Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna%} moved to the left of {%Droṇa%} and {%Karṇa%}.
{%Bhīma%} urged {%Arjuna%} to put forth all his vigour. {%Arjuna%}
{%& Droṇa & Karṇa%}, etc. (ζ) (description). {%Droṇa%} moved away
towards the north; the {%Pāṇḍava%} troops began to tremble;
the {%Pāñcālas & Droṇa; Drupada%} and {%Virāṭa%} + the three
grandsons of {%Drupada%} + the {%Cedis & Droṇa%}, who slew the
three grandsons of {%Drupada%}, vanquished the {%Cedis%}, etc. (η),
and slew {%Drupada%} and {%Virāṭa. Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} swore to slay
{%Droṇa%} that very day; {%Drupada%} with his division (from one
side) + {%Arjuna%} (from another side) & {%Droṇa + Duryo-%}
{%dhaṇa%}, etc. (θ); {%Bhīma%} urged {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, and they both
attacked {%Droṇa's%} division (description); soon the morning sun
arose (VII, {@186@}). The warriors adored the Sun, as he
rose, and the battle once more commenced (description);
neither {%Karṇa%}, etc. (ι), could be seen for dust. {%Duryodhana%},
[Page269-a+ 63]
etc. (κ), engaged in battle with four of the {%Pāṇḍava%} warriors:
{%Duryodhana%} + his brothers & {%Nakula%} and {%Sahadeva; Karṇa%}
{%& Bhīma; Droṇa & Arjuna; Nakula%} was worsted by {%Duryo-%}
{%dhana%} (VII, {@187@}); {%Sahadeva%} slew {%Duḥśāsana's%} driver;
{%Duḥśāsana%} was worsted by {%Sahadeva; Bhīma%} jumped into the
chariot of {%Nakula; Droṇa%} invoked the {%Aindra%}, etc. (λ),
weapons; D., G., Ṛ., Si., Aps., Y., and Rā. applauded {%Droṇa%} and
{%Arjuna%}, saying that “this is no human, etc. (μ), but a high
{%Brāhma%} encounter”; both employed the {%Brāhma%} weapon;
the engagement became general (VII, {@188@}). {%Duḥśāsana &%}
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, who vanquished him and proceeded against
{%Droṇa. Kṛtavarman%} + three of his brothers & {%Dhṛṣṭa-%}
{%dyumna + Nakula%} and {%Sahadeva%}, who checked them
(enumeration of unfair weapons that were not used);
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} proceeded towards {%Droṇa. Dhṛṣṭadyumna +%}
{%Sātyaki & Droṇa + Duryodhana%} (who grieved on account of his
former friendship with {%Sātyaki%}); {%Duryodhana%} was worsted by
{%Sātyaki; Karṇa%} rushed to the rescue of {%Duryodhana; Bhīma%}
rushed towards {%Karṇa. Yudhiṣṭhira%} urged his warriors to
rush to the rescue of {%Sātyaki, Bhīma%}, and the twins; {%Arjuna%}
attacked the {%Kurus%}, and {%Droṇa%} attacked the {%Pāñcālas%} (VII,
{@189@}). {%Droṇa%} caused a great carnage among the {%Pāñcālas%};
the {%Pāñcālas%} and {%Sṛñjayas & Droṇa%}; the {%Pāṇḍavas%} feared,
thinking that {%Arjuna%} would not fight with {%Droṇa. Kṛṣṇa%}
told {%Arjuna%} to abandon virtue and let some man tell {%Droṇa%}
that {%Aśvatthāman%} had been slain in battle. {%Arjuna%} did not
approve of it; others approved of it, but {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} with
great difficulty. {%Bhīma%} slew with a mace an elephant named
{%Aśvatthāman%} belonging to the {%Mālava%} chief {%Indravarman%},
and exclaimed before {%Droṇa%}: “{%Aśvatthāman%} has been slain.”
{%Droṇa%} did not believe {%Bhīma%}, but attacked {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}
and slew the {%Pāñcālas%} (and {%Somakas%}) with the {%Brāhma%}
weapon, and cut off the head of {%Vasudāna%}, and slew 500
{%Matsyas%}, etc. The Ṛ. {%Viśvāmitra%}, etc., etc. (ν), appeared in
the welkin and reproved {%Droṇa%} for using the {%Brāhma%} weapon
against persons not acquainted with it, and called upon
{%Droṇa%} to lay aside his weapons and leave the earth soon.
{%Droṇa%} asked {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} whether the report about {%Aśvatthā-%}
{%man's%} death was true; {%Kṛṣṇa%} urged {%Yudhiṣṭhra%} to save his
army by an untruth; {%Bhīma%} urged him to do the same;
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} distinctly said that {%Aśvatthāman%} was dead,
adding indistinctly the word “elephant”; before this {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira's%} chariot had stayed at a height of four fingers' breadth
from the surface of the earth; after this untruth his animals
touched the earth. {%Droṇa%} became quite dejected, also
after the words of the Ṛ., and beholding {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}
before him, could not fight as before (VII, {@190@}). {%Dhṛṣṭa-%}
{%dyumna & Droṇa%}; the celestial weapons no longer appeared
at {%Droṇa's%} bidding; his weapons, that had not been exhausted
for four days and one night, now became exhausted on the
third part of the fifth day. {%Droṇa%} took up another celestial
bow which {%Aṅgiras%} had given him; a fierce encounter took
place between {%Droṇa%} and {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}; none else had
arrows of that kind that {%Droṇa%} used in close fight except
{%Kṛpa%}, etc. (ξ); {%Sātyaki%} rescued {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} and was
applauded by {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%}, and the Si., etc. (VII,
{@191@}). {%Duryodhana, Karṇa%}, and {%Kṛpa + Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} sons
{%& Sātyaki + Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (ο); {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} urged his
troops against {%Droṇa%} (in order to aid {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}), who
again used the {%Brāhma%} weapon; {%Bhīma%} took up {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}
on his own chariot, and urged him to slay {%Droṇa%} quickly;
both {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} and {%Droṇa%} invoked the {%Brāhma%} weapon,
etc.: {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} began to slay the {%Vaśātis%}, etc. (π); {%Bhīma%}
[Page269-b+ 63]
again reminded {%Droṇa%} of {%Aśvatthāman's%} death, calling upon
{%Karṇa, Kṛpa%}, and {%Duryodhana%} to exert carefully in battle.
{%Droṇa%} laid his weapons aside, devoted himself to {%yoga%}, and
proceeded to heaven ({%Brahmaloka%}) in the company of the
foremost of Ṛ., in a blaze of light, that only {%Sañjaya%}, etc.
(ρ), saw; {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} cut off {%Droṇa's%} head—though for-
bidden by {%Arjuna%} and blamed by everybody—and threw it
down amongst the {%Kurus%}, who ran away in all directions,
except {%Aśvatthāman. Sañjaya%}, through the grace of {%Vyāsa%},
beheld {%Droṇa's%} proceeding after he had ascended the sky.
The {%Kurus%}, the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, and the {%Sṛñjayas%} all became
dejected and ran away; {%Bhīmasena%} and {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}
embraced each other, {%Bhīmasena%} expecting the slaughter of
{%Karṇa%} and {%Duryodhana%} (VII, {@192@}).
