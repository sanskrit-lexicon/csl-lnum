({%Nārāyaṇīvendrasenā%}, i.e. the wife of {%M., babhūva vaśyā nityaṃ%}
{%M°sya%}).—§ 520 (Vrīhidrauṇikap.): III, {@260@}, 15404.—
§ 520 (cf. Vrīhidrauṇikap.): Vyāsa said: There lived in
{%Kurukṣetra%} a virtuous sage named {%Mudgala%}, who lived by
picking up ears of corn and grain, collecting a {%droṇa%} of corn
during one fortnight and eating it together with his son and
wife the other fortnight; yet he celebrated the {%sattra%} called
{%iṣṭīkṛta%} and the {%darśa-%} and {%paurṇamāsa-%}sacrifices, where
{%Indra%} himself and the gods partook of the food offered, and
entertained his guests with food, for the remainder of the
{%droṇa%} of corn increased as soon as a guest appeared, so that
hundreds of brahmans were fed with it; he lived himself on
the food that remained after the gods and the guests had
[Page490-b+ 63]
eaten. Having heard of {%M. Durvāsas%}, naked and frantic,
came to him uttering insulting words, and during six seasons
ate up all his food, without perceiving any agitation in {%M.'s%}
heart. {%Durvāsas%} then told {%M%}. that in reward he should
go to heaven even in his own body. Immediately a celestial
messenger ({%devadūta%}) appeared upon a chariot yoked with
swans and cranes, etc., and invited {%M%}. to ascend it. {%M%}. first
asked the {%devadūta%} to tell him about the advantages and
disadvantages of heaven (III, {@260@}). The {%devadūta%} then
described heaven ({%Svarga%}) (atheists and untruthful persons
and those who have not practised ascetic austerities and
those who have not performed great sacrifices cannot repair
thither), with its advantages: myriads of beautiful worlds
owned by the gods, the {%Sādhyas%}, the {%Viśve%}, the {%maharṣis%},
the {%Yāmas%}, the {%Dhāmas%}, the {%Gandharvas%}, and the {%Apsarases%};
{%Meru%} extending over 33,000 yojanas; the gardens of the
celestials; {%Nandana%}, etc.; no grief, etc., no sweat, stench,
excreta, nor urine, nor dust; the foremost regions are the
regions of Brahmán ({%Brāhmaṇāḥ…lokāḥ%}); thither repair
sanctified {%ṛṣis%} and there dwell the {%Ṛbhus%}, the gods of the
gods themselves, who suffer no pangs from women, do not
possess wealth, etc., do not subsist on oblations nor
{%amṛta%}, and cannot be perceived by the senses, nor do they
change at the revolution of a {%kalpa%}; for them there is neither
ecstasy, nor joy, nor happiness, nor misery, etc.; they are
thirty-three in number, to their regions repair wise men
after having observed excellent vows, and also {%M%}. had
acquired that success by his charity. Its disadvantages:
while reaping the fruit of his acts a person cannot be
engaged in any others, for this world is one of acts, the
other one of fruition; after one has entirely exhausted his
merit, he is subject to fall; he is then stupefied and
agitated by emotions, and when the garlands of those who
are to fall fade away, fear invades their hearts; but by reason
of their merits they take birth among men, and then they
attain to high fortune and happiness, while, if one cannot
acquire knowledge here, he comes by an inferior birth. As
{%M%}. did not desire to go to heaven, but asked a region where
people have not to lament nor to be pained nor agitated, the
{%devadūta%} described to him the supreme seat of Viṣṇu, which
is called the highest {%Bráhman%} and lies above the abode of
{%Brahmán%}; thither only those who are free from selfishness,
etc., and those who are given to contemplation and {%yoga%}, can
repair. Then {%M%}. bade farewell to the {%devadūta%}, and being
always engaged in meditation, etc., he at last attained to
that supreme state of perfection ({%jagāma śāśvatāṃ siddhiṃ%}
{%parāṃ nirvāṇalakṣaṇām%}). “Therefore,” {%Vyāsa%} continued,
“you also, O son of {%Kuntī%}, ought not to grieve; after the
thirteenth year you will get back your kingdom.” Having
said this {%Vyāsa%} returned to his hermitage to practise
austerities (III, {@261@}): III, {@260@}, 15407, 15415, 15418,
15420, 15427, 15434; {@261@}, 15443, 15448, 15469, 15476,
(15481).—§ 677 (Mokṣadh.): XII, {@235@}, 8606 (Śata-
dyumna went to heaven after having given a mansion to
{%M%}.).—§ 721{%b%} (Viśvāmitrop.): XIII, {@4@}β, 250 (the same?,
son of Viśvāmitra). Cf. Maudgalya.
