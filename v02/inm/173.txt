and ({%b%}) Pṛśnigarbha, the three Rāmas, and Kṛṣṇa, from
Pṛśni and other manifestations of Aditi; it, however, seems
more probable that here is an allusion to the older conception
of seven Ādityas); {@47@}θ, 1626 ({%hiraṇyavarṇaṃ yaṃ garbham%}

“Aditi cooked food for the gods, hoping that, having eaten it,
they would kill the Asuras; there Budha…said to her,
‘Give me alms’; she, saying that it was only to be eaten by
the gods, gave him nothing, wherefore he cursed her, saying
that she would have a pain—{%vyathā%}—in her womb; in the
second birth—as an egg—of Vivasvat, the egg of his mother
Aditi was killed” (so B.); therefore Vivasvat Śrāddhadeva
became Mārttaṇḍa. Cf. also § 746 (Ānuśāsanik.): XIII, {@83@},
