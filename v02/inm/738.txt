{@Āpavopākhyāna@}¦ (“episode relating to Āpava, i.e.
Vasiṣṭha”). § 164 (cf. Bhīṣmotp.): {%Gaṅgā%} fully related
to {%Śāntanu%} the reason why the {%Brahmarṣi Vasiṣṭha%} (or
{%Āpava%}), the son of {%Varuṇa%}, had cursed the {%Vasus%}. When
the {%Vasus, Pṛthu%} (or {%Dhara%}), etc., were wandering with their
wives in the wood near {%Vasiṣṭha's%} hermitage, frequented by
the {%devarṣis, Dyaus%} was prevailed upon by his wife (assisted
by his brothers), in the interest of her friend {%Jitavatī%},
daughter of {%Uśīnara%}, to steal {%Vasiṣṭha's homadhenu [Nandinī]%}
(daughter of {%Kaśyapa%} and {%Surabhi%}, the daughter of {%Dakṣa%}),
by drinking whose milk one could remain in unchanged
youth for 1,000 years. {%Vasiṣṭha%}, however, was prevailed
upon to let among them {%Dyaus%} alone (who was to be con-
versant with all {%śāstras%}, etc.) dwell on earth for a long time
without marrying. Then {%Gaṅgā%}, taking with her the child
({%Gāṅgeya%} or {%Devavrata%}, i.e. {%Bhīṣma%}), went away, and {%Śāntanu%}
returned to his capital—“I shall now recount the virtues
of the {%Bhārata Śāntanu%}, whose splendid story is called the
{%Mahābhārata%}” (I, {@99@}). (For continuation v. Satyavatīlabhop.)
