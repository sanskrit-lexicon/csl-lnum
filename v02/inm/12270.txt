—§ 599{%g%} (Jayadrathavadhap.): {%V%}. was the father of the
{%Sindhu%} king {%Jayadratha%}, at whose birth an incorporeal voice
said that he would become one of the foremost of kṣatriyas,
[Page752-b+ 63]
but in a battle some conspicuous kṣatriya would cut off his
head. The {%Sindhu%} king {%V%}. then summoned all his kinsmen
and pronounced the curse, that he who would cause the head
of {%Jayadratha%} to fall to the earth, the head of that man would
crack into 100 pieces. Then he installed {%Jayadratha%} on the
throne, and, repairing to the woods, devoted himself to
ascetic austerities: VII, {@146@}, 6258 ({%Saindhavasya pitā%}),

Arjuna cut off the head of Jayadratha, Kṛṣṇa caused it to
fall on the lap of {%V.%}; thence it fell on the earth, and according
to the curse the head of {%V%}. broke to pieces); {@148@}ϕϕϕ, 6412
