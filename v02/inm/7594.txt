{@[Nāradāgamanaparvan]@}¦ (“the section containing the
arrival of Nārada,” the ninety-seventh of the minor parvans
of Mahābhārata; cf. Nāradāgamana).—§ 792: {%Vaiśampāyana%}
said: Two years after their return from the retreat of
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} the {%Pāṇḍavas%} were visited by D.-ṛ. {%Nārada%}.
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired after {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, etc. {%Nārada%} said:
After thy return from {%Kurukṣetra, Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} proceeded
towards {%Gaṅgādvāra%} with the sacrificial fire and {%Gāndhārī%},
{%Kuntī, Sañjaya%}, and all the {%yājakas%}. They themselves took to
severe austerities (description), while the sacred fire was duly
worshipped by the {%yājakas%}. They wandered about, {%Sañjaya%}
acting as a guide, {%Pṛthā%} becoming the eye of {%Gāndhārī%}.
Once Dhṛtarāṣṭra bathed in the {%Gaṅgā%}, and was returning to
his retreat. A violent forest conflagration set in; {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
dismissed {%Sañjaya%} and sat down, facing the east, with
{%Gāndhārī%} and {%Kuntī%}; they concentrated their soul, and were
burnt by the conflagration. {%Sañjaya%} escaped and was seen
by me ({%Nārada%}) on the banks of the {%Gaṅgā%} in the midst of
ascetics; he bade them farewell and started for {%Himavat%}.
In the course of my wanderings I saw the three bodies. The
ascetics, from whom I heard all the details, did not at all
grieve for them. {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: The {%Pāṇḍavas%} and
the citizens felt great grief (XV, {@37@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
lamented (α) (XV, {@38@}). {%Nārada%} comforted {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
by informing him of the sacred character of the fire that had
burnt {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} and the two queens. When {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
entered the woods he caused his sacrificial fires to be duly
ignited; having performed his sacred rites with them
he abandoned them all; then the {%Yājakas%} had left them
in a solitary part of the wood and gone away; the fires
thus left to themselves produced a general conflagration;
“this is what I have heard from the ascetics on the {%Gaṅgā%}.”
[Page507-b+ 63]
{%Vaiśampāyana%} said: Headed by {%Yuyutsu%} the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and
the citizens all proceeded to the {%Gaṅgā%} in order to offer
oblations of water to the deceased king and queens. Then
they came back, taking up their residence outside the city.
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} sent, a number of men to the retreat to cremate
the remains of his uncle, aunt, and mother in due form.
On the twelfth day he performed the {%śrāddhas%} with gifts in
abundance (description). Then all returned to {%Hāstinapura%}.
The great Ṛ. {%Nārada%}, having comforted {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, went
away. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} had passed three years in the forest
and fifteen years in the city. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} was plunged in
grief [*; not in B.] (XV, {@39@}).
