{@Viśvāmitra@},¦ a ṛṣi, son of Gādhi. § 5 (Anukram.): I, {@1@}α,
220 bis (in Nārada's enumeration of departed kings).—§ 134
(cf. Śakuntalop.): {%V%}. had deprived Vasiṣṭha of his children;
though born as a kṣatriya he became a brahman through his
penances, and created the river {%Kauśikī%} for his ablutions;
there, his wife, during a famine, was maintained by the
{%rājarṣi Mataṅga%}, who was living as a hunter; therefore,
when the famine was over, {%V%}. changed the name of the river
into {%Pārā%} and performed a sacrifice for {%Mataṅga%}, and {%Indra%}
himself, from fear, came there to drink {%soma. V.%}, in anger,
created another world and a series of nakṣatras, beginning
with {%Pratiśravaṇa%} (differently BR. {%sub voce%}), and gave pro-
tection to {%Triśaṅku%}, who was cursed by his {%guru%}; he could
burn the three worlds by his splendour, and by a kick
[Page729-a+ 63]
cause the earth to quake; he could sever {%Meru%}, and hurl it
away at any distance; he could go round the earth in a
moment, and {%Yama, Soma%}, the {%maharṣis%}, the {%Sādhyas%}, the
{%Viśvas%}, and the {%Vālakhilyas%} are afraid of his prowess. To
him {%Indra%} sent the {%Apsaras Menakā%}, who, assisted by {%Vāya%}
and {%Manmatha%}, disturbed his penances (I, {@71@}). {%V%}. begat on
{%Menakā%} a daughter, whom she abandoned on the banks of the
{%Mālinī%} in the valleys of {%Himavat%}. Vultures protected the
child from {%Rākṣasas%} and carnivorous animals, until she was
found and reared by {%Kaṇva%}, who called her {%Śakuntalā%},
because she had been protected by the birds ({%śakuntaiḥ%}): I,

protect the earth even with his best exertions. He then
heard of a great fear of {%Rākṣasas%}, and went out with his
army. In the hermitage of {%Vasiṣṭha%} his troops caused much
mischief; when the brahman {%Vasiṣṭha%} came to his hermitage,
he became angry and commanded his cow to create many

terrible {%Śabaras%}, who, encountering the army of {%V.%}, caused
a great carnage, and the troops fied away. {%V%}. then set his
heart on ascetic austerities, and in this {%tīrtha%} of the {%Sarasvatī%}
