[{@Yānasandhiparvan(°va)@}]¦ (“section relating to the
Yānasandhi”, q.v.), the 60th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.
§ 561. After the night had passed away, all the princes and
chiefs, {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (α) entered the court-hall (description)
to hear the message of {%Sañjaya%} (adorned with ear-rings), who
had come back from the {%Pāṇḍavas%} by the aid of {%Saindhava%}
steeds. {%Sañjaya%} related the salutations of the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (V,
{@47@}). {%Sañjaya%} related that {%Arjuna%} (! cf. § 556: Sañjaya-
yānap., V, {@23—28@}) had said, with {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} sanction,
that {%Sañjaya%} should say to {%Duryodhana%} and {%Karṇa%}, threatening
them with {%Bhīmasena%}, etc. (β), that if the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%}
desired war, then all the aims of the {%Pāṇḍavas%} were accom-
plished, as {%Duryodhana%} should lie down on the bare earth,
deprived of life, etc. {%Arjuna (b%}) trusted himself and {%Kṛṣṇa%}
({%c%}); he said that {%Duryodhana%} often thought of imprisoning
{%Kṛṣṇa%}, and sought to create a sudden disunion between
{%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%}. “There are with us many aged
{%brahmans%}, versed in various sciences…who are pro-
phesying the great destruction of the {%Kurus%} and the {%Sṛñjayas%},
and the ultimate victory of the {%Pāṇḍavas…%} thy bow
{%Gāṇḍīva%} yawns without being handled, etc.; on the top of
my flagstaff are heard terrific voices (‘when shall thy car be
yoked, O {%Kirīṭin?’%}); innumerable jackals howl at night,
and {%Rākṣasas%} frequently alight from the sky…I will
use the {%Sthūṇākarṇa, Pāśupata%}, and {%Brāhma%} weapons, and
all those that {%Śakra%} gave me.” [This speech of Arjuna is
not found in § 556: Sañjayayānap.] (V, {@48@}). {%Bhīṣma%} said
to {%Duryodhana%} that {%Nara%} and {%Nārāyaṇa (Nara-Nārāyaṇau%})
({%d%}) were {%Arjuna%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%}: it was with their aid that
{%Śakra%} vanquished the {%Daityas%} and {%Dānavas; Nara%} slew
hundreds and thousands of {%Paulomas%} and {%Kālakañjas%} in
battle; {%Arjuna%}, with an arrow, severed the head of the
{%Asura Jambha%} while the latter was about to swallow him;
he afflicted {%Hiraṇyapura%} on the other side of the ocean,
having vanquished in battle 60,000 of {%Nivātakavacas%}; and
in the same way also {%Nārāyaṇa%} has, in this world, destroyed
numberless other {%Daityas%} and {%Dānavas. Karṇa%} boasted that
he would slay all the {%Pāṇḍavas%} in battle, but was rebuked by
{%Bhīṣma%}, saying that {%Karṇa%} had seen his own brother slain by
{%Arjuna%} in the city of {%Virāṭa%}, and alluding to the contents of
the Goharaṇa-, and the Ghoṣayātrāparvan. {%Droṇa%} also
counselled peace, but got no answer from {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} (V, {@49@}).
At the request of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya%} related that the
[Page770-b+ 63]
{%Pañcālas%}, etc. (γ) looked up to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}. As he was
questioned about {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} and the {%Somakas%}, he first
fell down in a swoon. Then, regarding {%Bhīmasena (e%}) he
mentioned the lac-house, etc. (δ); regarding {%Arjuna%}, the
burning of the {%Khāṇḍava%} forest, etc. (ε); then {%Nakula (f%})
and {%Sahadeva (g); Śikhaṇḍin%} (ζ); the five {%Kekaya%} princes,
etc. (η) (V, {@50@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} was most afraid of {%Bhīma%}
(who was taller than {%Arjuna%} by the span of the thumb),
with his mace (full four cubits in length, with six sides),
mentioning his killing {%Jarāsandha%} (V, {@51@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
was also afraid of {%Arjuna%}, who he feared would conquer
{%Karṇa%} (being compassionate and heedless), and {%Droṇa%} (being
aged and having affection for his pupil Arjuna); “thirty-
three years have passed since the burning of the {%Khāṇḍava%}
forest; we have never heard of his being defeated any-
where” [but cf. the reading of B. {%trayastṛṃśat samāhūya%}, i.e.
challenging the thirty-three gods] (V, {@52@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
was afraid of the allies of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}: the {%Pāñcālas%},
{%Kekayas%}, etc. (θ) (V, {@53@}). {%Sañjaya%} rebuked {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} for
his behaviour towards the {%Pāṇḍavas%}; “the {%Matsyas%}, etc. (ι)
all decline to pay thee homage now” (V, {@54@}). {%Duryodhana%}
said, that when the {%Pāṇḍavas%} had been exiled, there came to
them {%Kṛṣṇa%}, etc. (κ), all assembled in a place not far from
{%Indraprastha%}, and suggested to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} that he should
take back the kingdom; “the people of the realm were all
annoyed with us, and all our friends also were angry with
us”; but {%Bhīṣma, Kṛpa%}, and {%Aśvatthāman%} had despised the
foes (“inflamed with anger at the death of his father this
{%Bhīṣma%}, in days of old, had conquered all the kings of the
earth, in a single chariot”). “Now the {%Pāṇḍavas%} are
without allies; and all these kings can, for my sake, enter
the fire or the sea…Having given up all hopes of a town,
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} craves only five villages…There is none on
earth equal to me in an encounter with the mace. In battle,
I am {%Saṅkarṣaṇa's%} equal; I will certainly slay {%Bhīma%},
{%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (λ), every one of these is singly capable of
slaying the {%Pāṇḍavas%}.” He alluded to the superhuman
circumstances concerning {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (μ), to the resolution
of the {%Saṃśaptakas%} to slay {%Arjuna%} or be slain by him; “our
chief warriors are {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (ν); they have seven
{%akṣauhiṇīs%}, we have eleven; {%Bṛhaspati%} has said, that an
army which is less by one-third ought to be encountered”
(V, {@55@}). At the request of {%Duryodhana, Sañjaya%} described
the chariots of {%Arjuna (h), Yudhiṣṭhira (i), Bhīmasena (j%}),
{%Sahadeva (k), Nakula (l%}); “and excellent steeds, presented
by the celestials, carry the sons of {%Subhadrā%} and {%Draupadī%}”
(V, {@56@}). At the request of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya%} mentioned
the allies of the {%Pāṇḍavas, Kṛṣṇa%}, etc. (ξ), and who had been
assigned to each of them as his share: {%Śikhaṇḍin & Bhīṣma%};
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} & the {%Madra%} king; {%Bhīmasena & Duryodhana's%}
sons and 100 brothers, the rulers of the east and the
south; {%Arjuna & Karṇa, Jayadratha%}, etc.; the five {%Kekayas%}
& the {%Kekayas, Mālavas, Śālvakas, Trigartau Saṃśaptakau%};
{%Abhimanyu & Duryodhana's%} sons (?), {%Duḥśāsana's%} sons, king
{%Bṛhadbala; Draupadeyāḥ + Dhṛṣṭadyumna & Droṇa%};
{%Cekitāna & Somadatta; Sātyaki & Kṛtavarman; Sahadeva%}
{%& Śakuni; Nakula & Ulūka, Sārasvatāḥ%}. All the other
kings had been distributed in their respective shares. Thus
the {%Pāṇḍava%} host had been distributed into divisions. {%Virāṭa%}
with all his {%Matsya%} warriors would support {%Śikhaṇḍin%}.
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} was exceedingly afraid of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (ο),
{%Duryodhana%} said that {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (π) were invincible.
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} maintained that {%Bhīṣma%} did not wish a battle.
[Page771-a+ 63]
{%Sañjaya%} said that {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} was always urging the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} to fight, and professed that he would alone encounter
all the assembled kings: {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (ρ), and his words
were approved by {%Yudhiṣṭhira; Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} had told
{%Sañjaya%} to say to the {%Kurus%}, etc. (σ), that they ought not to
suffer themselves to be slain by {%Arjuna%}, who was protected
by the celestials; they should send a good man to {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%} and entreat him to accept the kingdom. [This is not
found in Sañjayayānap., § 556] (V, {@57@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} men-
tioned that {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} led the {%brahmacarya%} mode of life
from his very youth, and saying that he himself, etc. (τ) did
not applaud war, he urged {%Duryodhana%} to desist from
hostilities and give back to the {%Pāṇḍavas%} their kingdom,
saying, that it was {%Karṇa, Duḥśāsana%}, and {%Śakuni%} who led
{%Duryodhana%} astray. {%Duryodhana%} answered that, without
depending upon {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, etc. (υ), he and {%Karṇa%} and
{%Duḥśāsana%} would perform, in honour of {%Yama%}, a sacrifice in
battle and slay the {%Pāṇḍavas%}; he said that he would sacrifice
his life rather than surrender to the {%Pāṇḍavas%} even that
much of land which may be covered by the sharp point of a
needle. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} said that he abandoned {%Duryodhana%} for
ever, and grieved for the kings who would be crushed by
{%Yuyudhāna%}, etc. (ϕ) (V, {@58@}). At the request of {%Dhṛta-%}
{%rāṣṭra, Sañjaya%} related how he had entered the inner apart-
ments (description) in order to inform {%Arjuna%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%};
he had seen two straight lines on {%Arjuna's%} foot-soles. {%Kṛṣṇa%}
had threatened the {%Kurus%}, mentioning that {%Kṛṣṇā%} had in-
voked him with tears, and that D., As., men, Y., G., and N.
were incapable of encountering {%Arjuna%} in battle, and alluding
to his exploits in the city of {%Virāṭa%} (v. Goharaṇap.) (V, {@59@}).
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} represented to {%Duryodhana%} that {%Agni%} would
help {%Arjuna%}, remembering what was done to him at {%Khāṇḍava%},
that {%Dharma%}, etc., would help the {%Pāṇḍavas%} from parental
affection, that {%Arjuna%} took up 500 arrows at a time, that
{%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (ω) regarded him as invincible, and said he
desired peace (V, {@60@}). {%Duryodhana%}, inflamed with wrath,
said that according to {%Vyāsa, Nārada%}, and {%Paraśu-Rāma%}, the
gods never engaged in work; if {%Agni, Vāyu, Dharma, Indra%},
or the {%Aśvins%} had ever engaged in work, the {%Pārthas%} could
never have fallen into distress, and they and the {%Maruts%}
would not venture to protect his foes; “charmed by me,
{%Agni%} will be instantly extinguished…,my energy is
greater than that of the gods;…it is I who set agoing
all the affairs of both gods and {%Asuras%}…; neither D. nor
G., nor As. nor Rā. are capable of saving him who has
incurred my displeasure…; thou wilt hear of the defeat
of the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, etc. (ψ);…whatever knowledge of
weapons there is in {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (ω), exists in me as well”
(V, {@61@}). {%Karṇa%} said to {%Duryodhana%}, mentioning the curse
of {%Paraśu-Rāma%}, when he, by a lie, obtained the {%Brāhma%}
weapon from him, that he would slay the {%Pāñcālas%}, etc. (αα).
{%Bhīṣma%} mentioned the {%Khāṇḍava%} forest, and said that the
dart which {%Karṇa%} had got from {%Indra%}, would be reduced to
ashes by {%Kṛṣṇa%} with his discus, and that his other shaft
(having a head like a serpent), which he respectfully wor-
shipped with flowery garlands, would be destroyed by {%Arjuna%}
because he was protected by {%Kṛṣṇa. Karṇa%} made the
pledge not to fight before {%Bhīṣma's%} fall, and went to his own
abode. {%Bhīṣma%} ridiculed {%Karṇa's%} boasting before the kings
of {%Avanti%}, etc. (ββ) (V, {@62@}). {%Duryodhana%} boasted; {%Vidura%}
praised self-restraint (V, {@63@}). {%Vidura%} related that once two
birds had flown away with the net in which they were
caught, but were again caught when they began to quarrel.
[Page771-b+ 63]
“So it is also with kinsmen. Once we, with some hunters and
{%brahmans%} conversant with magic and charms, repaired to the
northern mountain {%Gandhamādana%}, with excellent medicinal
herbs, and inhabited by Si. and G. There was, on a pre-
cipice, some honey, {%Kubera's%} favourite drink, guarded by
poisonous snakes; the {%brahmans%} said that a mortal drinking
of it would win immortality, a sightless man obtain sight,
and an old man would become a youth. The hunters desired
to obtain it, and all perished. So it is with {%Duryodhana%}.
In a single chariot {%Arjuna%} conquered the whole earth;
{%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa%}, etc. were routed by him at the city of
{%Virāṭa%}. Remember also {%Drupada%} and the king of the
{%Matsyas%}” (V, {@64@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} warned {%Duryodhana%} against
the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, etc. (γγ), and recommended him to follow
{%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (δδ) as his guides, mentioning the combat at
the city of {%Virāṭa%} (V, {@65@}). At the request of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%},
{%Sañjaya%} related that {%Arjuna%} had said that {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (εε)
were all on the eve of death, if they did not give up to
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} his own share of the kingdom (V, {@66@}). As
{%Duryodhana%} showed little regard for the words of {%Sañjaya%},
and the rest remained silent, the assembled kings rose and
retired. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, who always followed the counsels of
his son, began to inquire in secret of {%Sañjaya%} about the
resolves of his own party and of the foes. {%Sañjaya%} caused
him to let {%Vidura%} introduce {%Vyāsa%} and {%Gāndhārī%} (V, {@67@}).
{%Sañjaya%} extolled {%Kṛṣṇa (m%}), and mentioned some of those
whom he had vanquished (ζζ) (V, {@68@}). Discourse between
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} and {%Sañjaya%} on the attributes of {%Kṛṣṇa%}.
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} told {%Duryodhana%} to seek refuge with {%Kṛṣṇa%}.
{%Duryodhana%} refused. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} complained of him to
{%Gāndhārī. Gāndhārī%} threatened {%Duryodhana%} with {%Bhīmasena%}.
{%Vyāsa%} recommended to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} to seek salvation through
{%Kṛṣṇa%}. Requested by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya%} explained the
path of salvation through {%Kṛṣṇa%} (V, {@69@}). At the request
of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya%} enumerated some names of {%Kṛṣṇa%}
(V, {@70@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} complained that he could not see
{%Kṛṣṇa%}, whom he extolled under several names (ηη) (V, {@71@}).
