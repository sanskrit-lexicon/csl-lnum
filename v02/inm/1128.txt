{@Bakavadhaparvan@}¦ (“the slaughter of Baka,” the 10th
of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.). § 215: I, {@157@} ff.: The
{%Pāṇḍavas%} for some time dwelt in the abode of the {%brahman%},
living on alms; {%Bhīma%} alone used to eat one-half of the
[Page105-b+ 63]
alms. One day {%Bhīma%} and {%Kuntī%} overheard the {%brahman%}
complaining (I, {@157@}), and his wife (I, {@158@}) and daughter
asked to be sacrificed for him to a {%rākṣasa%}, and their little
son said that he would slay the {%rākṣasa%} with a blade
of grass. {%Kuntī%} approached (I, {@159@}), and learned that the
{%rākṣasa Baka%} (“king of the {%Asuras%},” v. 6808), a cannibal,
protected the town and the country, receiving as his fee
a cartload of rice, two buffaloes, and the human being
who brought them to him, from one after another of the
householders, while the king, residing in {%Vetrakīyagṛha%} (see
BR.), did nothing to protect the country against him.
Now the turn had come for the {%brahman%}, and as he had no
wealth to buy a man, and could not part with any of his
family, he would go with all his family to the {%rākṣasa%}, in
order that he might devour them all (I, {@160@}). {%Kuntī%} said
that one of her sons would bring the food to the {%rākṣasa%}.
This the {%brahman%} energetically refused, until she had told
him that on account of his strength and {%mantras%} her son
would be safe; but he ought not to disclose this fact to
anybody, for then people might trouble them out of curiosity,
and if her son imparted his knowledge to anybody he would
himself no longer be able to profit by it. {%Bhīma%} also
consented (I, {@161@}). When the others returned home with
their alms, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} blamed his mother for her rash act;
but she relied on {%Bhīma%} (I, {@162@}). The next morning {%Bhīma%}
set out for the abode of the {%rākṣasa%}, and approaching he
began himself to eat the food he carried, loudly calling the
{%rākṣasa%} by his name. The {%rākṣasa%} came out in a fury;
but {%Bhīma%}, disregarding his yells and blows, leisurely ate
up the whole of that food and washed his hands. Then they
began to hurl trees at each other, and thereupon they clasped
each other with their arms. At last {%Bhīma%} pressed {%Baka%}
down to the earth, and placing one knee on the middle of
his back, bent him double, while he ({%Baka%}) roared frightfully
and began to vomit blood (I, {@163@}). {%Baka%} died uttering
frightful yells. The {%rākṣasas%}, his relatives, came and
promised never again to kill human beings, and from that
day the {%rākṣasas%} of that region were very peaceful towards
mankind. {%Bhīma%} placed the corpse at one of the gates of the
town, and went away unobserved. The {%brahman%} told the
citizens that it was a {%brahman%} skilled in {%mantras (mantra-%}
{%siddha%}) who had slain the {%rākṣasa%}, and they established
a {%Brahma%} festival ({%brahmamahaṃ%}) (I, {@164@}).
