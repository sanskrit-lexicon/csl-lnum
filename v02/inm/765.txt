{@Āraṇyakaparvan@}¦ (“section relating to the forest life of
the Pāṇḍavas,” the 30th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.).
§ 308: The {%Pāṇḍavas%} set out from {%Hāstinapura%} through the
{%Vardhamāna%} gate with their weapons, accompanied by
{%Kṛṣṇā%}, in a northerly direction. {%Indrasena%} and other
servants, 14 in number (see BR. s.v. {%pari%}; Nīl. and PCR.
take it to be = 15), with their wives, followed them on
swift cars. The citizens wished to leave the town and
follow them, but were prevailed upon by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to
return and cherish {%Bhīṣma, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Vidura, Kuntī%},
etc. About the close of the day the {%Pāṇḍavas%} reached the
banian {%Pramāṇa%} on the banks of the {%Gaṅgā%}, purified them-
selves by touching the water, and passed the night there,
taking water alone as their sole sustenance, in the company
of brahmans with and without fire, who had followed them
(III, {@1@}). When the day broke in, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} tried to
prevail upon the brahmans to leave him, in order that they
might not undergo sufferings, living on fruits, roots, and
deer. But they declared that they would follow him,
themselves providing their own food.—§ 309: Then
a learned brahman, {%Śaunaka%}, versed in {%Sāṅkhya%} and {%Yoga%},
quoting the ślokas of {%Janaka%}, told {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} not only
to retire from the world, but also in his heart not to mind
the loss of his wealth. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} declared that it was
not from avarice, but only because he could no more support
the brahmans, that he regretted his wealth; “nobody should
cook his food for himself alone, and nobody should slay an
animal without devoting it to the gods, the pitṛs, and guests,
nor should one eat of that food which had not been duly
dedicated to the gods and the pitṛs.” {%Śaunaka%} said that
sacrifices, study, gifts, and penance pave the way to the
world of the {%Pitṛs%}—truth, forgiveness, subduing the senses,
and renunciation of desire to the heaven of the gods, and
they should be practised without reference to self ({%abhimāna%}).
It was by their wealth of {%yoga%} that the {%Rudras, Sādhyas%},
{%Ādityas, Vasus%}, and {%Aśvins%} rule over the creatures. So
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, who had already achieved success as to his
[Page066-b+ 63]
indebtedness towards his ancestors and as to sacrifices, now
ought to seek success in {%yoga%} and in ascetic austerities;
then he would be able to realize all his wishes (III, {@2@}).
—§ 310: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} then, having consulted {%Dhaumya%},
was taught by him (as {%Bhīma, Kārtavīrya, Vainya%}, and
{%Nahuṣa%} had by ascetic meditation delivered the people from
affliction) 108 names of {%Sūrya%} (α), [originally] proclaimed
by {%Svayambhū%} (i.e. Brahmán)* (the Sun). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%},
touching the water of Gaṅgā, with his senses under control,
and feeding upon air alone, stood engaged in {%prāṇāyāma%},
and began a hymn in praise of {%Sūrya (b%}) (the Sun). The
Sun then showed himself to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and gave him
a copper vessel, saying that if {%Pāñcālī%} (i.e. {%Kṛṣṇā%}) kept
this vessel fruits, roots, meat, and vegetables, cooked in
their kitchen, would be inexhaustible for twelve years.
Then the god vanished. Rising from the water, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
took hold of {%Dhaumya's%} feet and embraced his brothers.
The clean food that was dressed, however little, became
inexhaustible, and only after the brahmans, the brothers,
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, and at last {%Kṛṣṇā%} had eaten the day's food
became exhausted. Having then performed sacrifices, they
set out for the {%Kāmyaka%} wood, accompanied by {%Dhaumya%}
and the brahmans (III, {@3@}).—§ 311: {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} asked
{%Vidura%} what they should do to secure the good-will of
the citizens. {%Vidura%} said that he must give back to the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} all that had been theirs, let {%Duryodhana, Śakuni%},
and {%Karṇa%} wait upon them, and {%Duḥśāsana%} ask their
forgiveness in open court, and if {%Duryodhana%} would not
consent to reign in peace jointly with {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, he
ought to abandon him and let {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} reign alone.
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} did not approve, and saying “stay or go, as
thou listest,” he suddenly rose and went away, and {%Vidura%}
went away to the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (III, {@4@}).—§ 312: Starting from
the {%Gaṅgā%}, the {%Pāṇḍavas%} went to {%Kurukṣetra%}, performed
ablutions in the {%Sarasvatī, Dṛśadvatī%}, and {%Yamunā%}, and,
travelling in a westerly direction, they arrived at the
{%Kāmyaka%} wood on the {%Sarasvatī%}. There {%Vidura%} came to them
in a single car. When seeing him, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} was afraid
that he brought an invitation to a new match at dice with
{%Śakuni%} about their weapons. {%Vidura%} told them that he had
been forsaken by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, and gave them advice how to
secure adherents (III, {@5@}).—§ 313: After {%Vidura%} had gone
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} repented and fell down senseless, and having
regained consciousness caused {%Sañjaya%} to bring {%Vidura%} back
(III, {@6@}). {%Duryodhana%}, being afraid because {%Vidura%} had
returned, held counsel with {%Śakuni, Karṇa%}, and {%Duḥśāsana%},
who were of opinion that the {%Pāṇḍavas%} would remain the
promised space of time in the wood. As {%Duryodhana%}, however,
was not contented, {%Karṇa%} proposed to set out and slay them.
When they had gone out {%Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana%} came upon
them and commanded them to desist, and then appeared
before {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} (III, {@7@}). {%Vyāsa%} warned {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
against permitting {%Duryodhana%} to try to slay the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
(III, {@8@}).—§ 314: As {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} said he was unable to
cast off his senseless son, {%Vyāsa%} told him: One day, when
{%Indra%} saw {%Surabhi%} weeping in heaven, and asked her why
she wept, she told him that one of her offspring (a cow) was
exceedingly harassed by a husbandman; and although she
had 1,000 offspring, and her affections flowed equally towards
all, yet she felt greater compassion for the weak. {%Indra%}
poured down a shower of rain and caused obstruction to the
husbandman's work. “So I feel anxious regarding the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} in distress; let thy affections be greater towards
[Page067-a+ 63]
the weak, and let {%Duryodhana%} make peace with them”
(III, {@9@}).—§ 315: Maitreya-śāpa (q.v.) (III, {@10@}).
