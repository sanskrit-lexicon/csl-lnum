[{@Manuṣyagrahakathana(ṃ)@}]¦ (“on the demons that
possess mankind”). § 502 (cf. Skandop.). The six divorced
wives of the {%ṛṣis%}, together with {%Vinatā%}, obtained permission
from {%Skanda%} to become his mothers. At the request of
{%Indra%} the {%Kṛttikās%} (i.e. the six wives of the {%ṛṣis%}) (together
with {%Vinatā%}, see v. 14464 and Nīl.) are placed among the
{%nakṣatras%} (and presided over by {%Agni%}) instead of {%Abhijit%}, the
younger sister of {%Rohiṇī%}, who from jealousy had repaired to
the woods. {%Brahmán%} ordered that time should be reckoned
from {%Dhaniṣṭhā%}, while it had formerly been reckoned from
{%Rohiṇī%} (so Nīl.). Then (these seven) mothers asked {%Skanda%}
that they might become the mothers of the worlds instead of
the old mothers ({%Brāhmī, Māheśvarī%}, etc.; Nīl.) and devour
the progeny of those old mothers, because they had slandered
them before their husbands, and always dwell with {%Skanda%}.
{%Skanda%} granted that until the age of 16 years they should
have the power of afflicting the human kind, and he
loosed from his body his {%Raudra%} nature, under the name
of {%Skandāpasmāra%}, that they might dwell with him.
Enumeration of several grahas (the number 18 in v. 14490
is difficult to explain), among others (α) the male and female
children of {%Skanda%} (the males are the husbands of the
females); they are all named {%Skandagrahas%}; they are
propitiated with offerings, ablutions, unguents, etc., and
particularly by the worship of {%Skanda%}; and when they are
propitiated they bestow good on men. Then are mentioned
the {%grahas%}, that afflict men from the 16th to the 70th year;
after the 70th year fever takes the place of the {%grahas%}.
These evil spirits always avoid those who have subdued
their senses, etc., and those who are devoted to {%Maheśvara%}
(III, {@230@}).
