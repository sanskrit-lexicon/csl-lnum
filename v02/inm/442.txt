[{@Aṃśāvataraṇa(m)@}]¦ (“incarnations”), comprehends the
three first chapters of Sambhavaparvan (vii), i.e. I, {@65—67@}.
§ 85: Conformably to the consultation held between <is>Indra</is>
and <is>Nārāyaṇa</is>, the celestials were born in the lines of
brahmarṣis and rājarṣis, and they slew the Dānavas, Rā.,
G., and Snakes, etc. <is>Janamejaya</is> desired to hear, from the

upādhyāya of the Asuras was Śukra or Uśanas, son of a ṛṣi;
he had four sons who sacrificed for the Asuras ({%Tvaṣṭā%}—so
BR.—{%Dharas tathātriś ca dvāv[!] anyau raudrakarmiṇau%};
ought we not to read {%Jaṭādharas%} or something of the sort?
PCR. has: {%Tvaṣṭādhara…Raudra%} and {%Karmin%}); they
were {%Brahmaloka-parāyaṇāḥ%}. This progeny of the Asuras and
[Page033-b+ 63]

sons were the companions of the Sun ({%Pataṅgasahacāriṇaḥ%},
i.e. the Vālikhilyas; so Nīl. and PCR.).—§ 115: The ṛṣi
Prajāpati Dakṣa sprang from the right toe of Brahmán, and
Dakṣa's wife from the left toe of Brahmán; he had lost his
sons ({%naṣṭaputraḥ%}, v. § 138), but had fifty daughters, whom

Enumeration of the ten wives of Dharma ({%dvārāṇy etāni%}
{%Dharmasya vihitāni Svayambhuvā%}). The twenty-seven wives
of Soma are all junction-stars of the nakṣatras ({%nakṣatra-%}

not enumerated).—§ 116: The Vasus (q.v.) with their
mothers and sons and grandsons, etc.; especially Kumāra ({%b%}),

{%manujaḥ sarvapāpaiḥ pramucyate.”%}—§ 121: Bhṛgu came out
ripping open the heart of Brahmán. Bhṛgu's son was Kavi,
and Kavi's son was the planet Śukra (or do Kavi, Kaviputra,
and Śukra signify one and the same person, which seems
to be the opinion of PCR.?), who was appointed by
Svayambhū to give and withhold rain, and to inflict and
remit calamities, and who by the power of asceticism
({%yogācāryo%}) became the guru both of the Daityas and of the
gods.—§ 122: As he (Śukra) was thus employed by Vidhi
(i.e. Brahmán) in seeking welfare ({%yogakṣemāya%}), Bhṛgu
begat Cyavana, who, falling out of his mother's womb
through anger, released her (cf. § 20). Cyavana's wife was
Āruṣī, daughter of Manu; their son Aurva came out
ripping open the thigh of Āruṣī.

cocoanut, according to PCR.—and a daughter, Śukī; IX,
Surasā (mother of Kaṅka, i.e. a species of long-feathered
birds).—§ 128: Aruṇa's wife, Śyenī, gave birth to Sampāti

sons (i.e. the Rākṣasas), except Duryodhana, who was
a portion of Kali, and ({%f%}) a daughter, Duḥśalā. Nakula and

creatures. Soma set a condition for letting his son Varcas
be incarnate in Abhimanyu. ({%g%}) Draupadī's five sons
