{@Rāmopākhyānaparvan@}¦ (“the episode relating to
Rāma<sup>2</sup>,” i.e. the subject-matter of the Rāmāyaṇa; it is the
48th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.). (Cf. Rāmopākhyāna,
Rāmāyaṇa.) § 525: As {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked {%Mārkaṇḍeya%}
if he knew any one more unfortunate than he was (III,
{@273@}), {%Mārkaṇḍeya%} related the story of {%Rāma Dāśarathi%}:
King {%Aja%} of {%Ikṣvāku's%} race had a son {%Daśaratha%}, who had
four virtuous sons: {%Rāma%} (son of {%Kausalyā%}), {%Lakṣmaṇa%}
and {%Śatrughna%} (sons of {%Sumitrā%}), and {%Bharata%} (son of
{%Kaikeyī%}). {%Sītā%}, the daughter of the {%Videha%} king {%Janaka%},
was created by {%Tvaṣṭṛ%} himself to become the wife of {%Rāma%}.
{%Prajāpati%} ({%Pitāmaha, Svayambhū%}, the Creator of all the
worlds) had a mind-born son {%Pulastya%}, who with a cow
begat a son {%Vaiśravaṇa%} (i.e. {%Kubera%}). Leaving his father,
{%Vaiśravaṇa%} went to his grandfather, and angered at this, his
father with half of his own self became born as {%Viśravas%} for
wreaking vengeance on {%Vaiśravaṇa%}. But {%Pitāmaha%}, pleased
with {%Vaiśravaṇa%}, gave him immortality and made him the
sovereign of wealth ({%Dhaneśa%}), a {%lokapāla%} and friend of {%Īśāna%},
and gave him a son {%Nalakūbara%}, and {%Laṅkā%} for his capital,
guarded by hosts of {%Rākṣasas%}, and the {%vimāna Puṣpaka%}
capable of going everywhere, and the kingship of the {%Yakṣas%},
etc. (III, {@274@}).—§ 526: The {%muni Viśravas%} was greatly
enraged against {%Vaiśravaṇa. Kubera (Naravāhana%}), the king
of the {%Rākṣasas%}, always sought to please his father, and,
living in {%Laṅkā%}, sent three {%Rākṣasa%} women (α) skilled in
singing and dancing to wait upon him. {%Pulastya%} granted them
boons: to {%Puṣpotkaṭā%} two sons: {%Kumbhakarṇa%} and {%Daśa-%}
{%grīva (= Rāvaṇa); Mālinī%} bore one son, {%Vibhīṣaṇa; Rākā%}
became the mother of the twins {%Khara%} and {%Śūrpaṇakhā%}.
{%Vibhīṣaṇa%} surpassed everybody in beauty and was very pious;
{%Daśagrīva%} was energetic and strong; {%Kumbhakarṇa%} was the
most powerful in battle and a master of illusion; {%Khara%} was
proficient in archery and hostile to {%brahmans; Śūrpaṇakhā%}
troubled the ascetics ({%siddhavighnakarī%}). Learned in the
{%Vedas%}, they lived with their father on {%Gandhamādana%}. And
there they beheld {%Vaiśravaṇa%} seated with their father, and
seized with jealousy, they gratified {%Brahmán%} with severe
penances (β), while {%Khara%} and {%Śūrpaṇakhā%} protected and
attended on them. After 1,000 years {%Daśagrīva%}, cutting off
his head (i.e. heads), offered it (i.e. them) in the fire, and
{%Brahmán%} appeared and made them desist from their
austerities, granting them boons (γ) except immortality.
Now {%Daśagrīva%} defeated {%Kubera%} in battle and drove him
from {%Laṅkā; Kubera%} then, followed by {%Gandharvas, Yakṣas%},
{%Rākṣasas%}, and {%Kinnaras%}, went to live on {%Gandhamādana%}.
{%Rāvaṇa%} took from him {%Puṣpaka%}, upon which {%Vaiśravaṇa%}
cursed him saying: “This chariot shall never carry thee,
but him who will slay thee in battle, and as thou hast
insulted thy elder brother thou shalt soon die.” {%Vibhīṣaṇa%}
followed {%Kubera%}, who invested him with the command of
the {%Yakṣa%} and {%Rākṣasa%} hosts. On the other hand, the
man-eating {%Rākṣasas%} and {%Piśācas%} anointed {%Daśagrīva%} as their
sovereign. {%Daśagrīva%} deprived the gods and {%Daityas%} of their
valuable possessions, and because he terrified ({%rāvayām āsa%},
v. 15928) all creatures, he was called {%Rāvaṇa%} (III, {@275@}).
The {%Brahmarṣis, Siddhas%}, and {%Devarṣis%}, with {%Agni%} as their
spokesman, sought the protection of {%Brahmán%}, who said that
the four-armed {%Viṣṇu%} had already been incarnate for this
object, and caused {%Indra%} and the gods, {%Gandharvas%}, and
{%Dānavas%} to beget strong sons, capable of assuming any
[Page593-b+ 63]
form at will, on monkeys and bears; and the {%Gandharvī%}
{%Dundubhī%} he caused to be born on earth as the hunch backed
{%Mantharā%}, who, instructed by {%Brahmán%}, went hither and
thither ever engaged in fomenting quarrels (III, {@276@}).—
§ 527: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Mārkaṇḍeya%} related: The
sons of {%Daśaratha%} were conversant with the {%Vedas%} and the
{%Dhanurveda. Rāma%} equalled {%Indra%} and {%Bṛhaspati%}. At night,
the {%Puṣya%} being in a lucky conjuncture, {%Rāma%} was to
be invested as {%yuvarāja. Mantharā%} aroused the jealousy
of {%Kaikeyī%} against {%Kausalyā, Kaikeyī%} prevailed upon
{%Daśaratha%} that {%Bharata%} should be anointed and {%Rāma%} be
in exile in the forest of {%Daṇḍaka%} for fourteen years. {%Rāma%}
was accompanied by {%Lakṣmaṇa%} and {%Sītā. Daśaratha%} died.
{%Bharata%} rebuked {%Kaikeyī%} and set off to find {%Rāma%},
accompanied by {%Kausalyā, Sumitrā, Kaikeyī, Śatrughna%},
{%Vasiṣṭha, Vāmadeva%}, etc. He saw {%Rāma%} and {%Lakṣmaṇa%}
on the mountain {%Citrakūṭa%}, but {%Rāma%} would adhere to
the order of his father. {%Bharata%} then ruled in Nandi-
grāma, keeping before him the shoes of {%Rāma%}.—§ 528:
{%Rāvaṇagamana%} (q.v.).—§ 529: {%Sītāharaṇa%} (q.v.).—§ 530:
{%Viśvāvasumokṣaṇa%} (q.v.).—§ 531: Having bathed in the
lake {%Pampā, Rāma%} and {%Lakṣmaṇa%} on the mountain {%Ṛṣya-%}
{%mūka%} beheld the monkey-king {%Sugrīva%} (whom his brother
{%Vālin%} had deprived of his wife {%Tārā%} and his kingdom) and
his four counsellors, {%Hanūmat%} (equalling {%Himavat%}), etc.
{%Sugrīva%} showed {%Rāma%} a piece of cloth that had been dropped
by {%Sītā. Sugrīva%} promised to bring back {%Sītā. Rāma%}
installed {%Sugrīva%} as king of all the monkeys and promised to
slay {%Vālin%}. Then they all repaired to {%Kiṣkindhyā. Vālin%}
came out; {%Tārā%} (who understood the voice of every creature)
told him that it was {%Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, Ṃainda, Dvivida%},
{%Hanūmat, Jāmbavat%} (the king of the bears), and {%Sugrīva%} who
had come to destroy him. {%Vālin%} suspected {%Tārā%}. Near the
mountain {%Mālyavat%} he had an encounter with {%Sugrīva%}.
{%Hanūmat%} placed a garland round {%Sugrīva's%} neck (so that he
shone like the mountain Malaya), and {%Rāma%} recognized
{%Sugrīva%} by that sign and killed {%Vālin%} with an arrow. {%Sugrīva%}
thus regained {%Kiṣkindhyā%} and {%Tārā. Rāma%} dwelt on
Mālyavat for four months.—§ 532: {%Sītāsāntvana%} (q.v.).—
