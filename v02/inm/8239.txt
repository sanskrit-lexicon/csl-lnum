[{@Pativratopākhyāna@}]¦ (“the story of the faithful wife”)
and [{@Brāhmaṇavyādhasaṃvāda@}] (“a conversation
between a brahman and a hunter”) (cf. Pativratāyā
ākhyānaṃ). § 479 (Mārkaṇḍ.): Questioned by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
about the virtue of women, {%Mārkaṇḍeya%}, saying that the
work of a mother is more difficult than that of a father, and
that for women neither sacrifices nor {%śrāddhas%} nor fasts are
of any efficacy, but that they can win heaven only by serving
their husbands (III, {@205@}), related: When the {%brahman%}
{%Kauśika%}, who had studied the Vedas and the Upaniṣads,
was reciting the Vedas under a tree, a female crane befouled
his body, and looked upon with anger by {%Kauśika%} fell to
the ground. {%Kauśika%} regretted his angry deed. When
he had entered a village in order to procure alms, in
a certain house the wife first served her husband, who came
home tired and hungry, with food, etc. (description), and
then began to conciliate the angry {%Kauśika%}, who blamed her
for exalting her husband above the {%brahmans%}. She said that
she was no she-crane, that she knew that the ocean had been
made brackish and undrinkable by the wrath of the {%brahmans%},
that the fire of their wrath had not to this day been
extinguished in the forest of {%Daṇḍaka%}, but that she regarded
her husband as her supreme god, and deserved forgiveness,
that anger is a foe to men within themselves, and that
the gods know him to be a {%brahman%} who has abandoned
anger and passion, etc.; and who, though himself injured,
never returns the injury, etc., that virtue ({%dharma%}) is difficult
to understand, but must be based on truth; the ancients have
declared that virtue depends on {%śruti%}, but it is variously
defined ({%bahudhā dṛśyate%}) and subtle to be understood
({%sūkṣma%}); “thou art cognisant of virtue and studiest the
Vedas; but I think, however, that thou dost not know what
virtue really is; a fowler ({%vyādha%}) in {%Mithilā%} will discourse
to thee on virtue.” {%Kauśika%} blessed her, and returned to his
abode, reproaching himself (III, {@206@}).—§ 480: He set out
for {%Mithilā%} (description), ruled over by {%Janaka%}, and found
out the fowler, who was seated in a butcher's yard, selling
venison and buffalo meat to a large crowd of buyers; but he
at once went to {%Kauśika%}, and proving that he knew why he
had come, he led him to his abode, where he honoured him
duly, and explained to him that, notwithstanding his cruel
trade, which he had inherited from his sires and grandsires,
and which belonged to his caste by birth, he led a virtuous
life, serving his superiors and old people, speaking truth, never
[Page546-a+ 63]
envying others, giving to the best of his power, etc. In the
kingdom of {%Janaka%} there did not exist a single subject that
did not follow the duties of his caste. He did not slay the
boars and buffaloes himself, nor did he eat meat himself;
he fasted during the day and ate in the night; “even though
the behaviour of his order be bad, a person may yet be himself
of good behaviour; so also a person may become virtuous,
although he may by profession be a slayer of animals.” It is
the fault of the kings when the subjects decay, and monsters,
dwarfs, etc., are produced, but {%Janaka%} ruled justly. If one
repents a wrong done by him, he is delivered from his
sin (v. 13751). If a man seeks redemption ({%kalyāṇam%}
{%abhipadyate%}) after having committed a sin, he becomes purified
of all his sins (v. 13756). It is temptation ({%lobha%}) that
constitutes the basis of sin. Then he gave some advice as
to what is virtuous conduct (v. 13794 foll.: “these three are
said to constitute the perfect way ({%padaṃ%}) of the virtuous:
a man must not do wrong to anybody, he must give alms,
and must always be truthful”); (v. 13797 foll.: “freedom
from malice, forbearance, peace of mind, contentment, pleasant
speech, renunciation of desires and anger, virtuous conduct,
and actions regulated according to the ordinances of the sacred
texts, constitute the perfect way ({%mārgaṃ%}) of the virtuous”)
(III, {@207@}). The fowler and the animals slain by him are
driven by their {%karman%} in a former life. In days of yore
2,000 animals and 2,000 cows used to be killed every day in
the kitchen of king {%Rantideva%}; at the {%cāturmāsya%} animals are
sacrificed; the {%śruti%} says, “The fires are fond of meat”
(v. 13812), and at the sacrifices animals are killed by the
regenerate, and these animals are purged of sin, and by
{%mantras%} go to heaven. Regarding animal food this rule
has been laid down by {%munis%}: Whoever partakes of animal
food after having first offered it duly and respectfully
({%yathāvidhi yathāśrāddhaṃ%}) to the gods and the {%Pitṛs%}, is
not polluted by the act. The {%śruti%} says, “Such a man is
not one who partakes of animal food,” and a {%brahman%} who
has intercourse with his wife during her season is a {%brahma-%}
{%cārin%}. King {%Saudāsa%}, under the influence of a curse, ate
human flesh. Agriculture is considered to be praiseworthy,
though the plough destroys many creatures. Seeds of
rice, etc., are all living creatures. As to hunting and the
cutting of trees and herbs, many creatures live in trees
and fruits and water. The earth and the air are all swarming
with living organisms, which are unconsciously destroyed by
men from mere ignorance (III, {@208@}). When life is at stake
and in the matter of marriage, it is justified to tell an untruth.
Whichever conduces most to the good of all creatures is
considered to be truth ({%satyaṃ%}) (v. 13845; cf. v. 13990).
The fowler discoursed upon the influence of {%karman%} upon
metempsychosis and salvation ({%mokṣa; Brahmaṇaḥ padaṃ%},
v. 13895) (III, {@209@}).—§ 481: Questioned by {%Kauśika%}
about the senses, the fowler discoursed about the sinful (in
thought, word, and action (v. 13906); the evolution of sin
is this: First {%manas%} is bent on {%vijñāna%}; thence successively
originate {%kāma, roṣa, karman, rāga, dveṣa, lobha, moha, vyāja%},
{%adharma, pāpa%}). The virtuous man discerns these evils by
means of his spiritual insight (v. 13908).—§ 482: Then he
shortly enumerated the elements of the {%brāhmī vidyā%} (the
universe, consisting of the five great elements, space, wind,
fire, water, and earth, is {%Bráhman%} [neuter]; their qualities:
sound, touch, form, flavour, and taste; {%manas, buddhi, ahaṅ-%}
{%kāra%}; the five senses, {%ātman, rajas, sattva, tamas%}; the last
seventeen are {%“rāśir avyaktasañjñakaḥ”%}, in all (with the
[Page546-b+ 63]
objects of senses and the manifest and the unmanifest)
twenty-four ({%caturviṃśaka ity eṣa vyaktāvyaktamayo guṇaḥ%})
[read {%gaṇah%}, cf. Hopkins, Great Epic, p. 34] (III, {@210@}).—
§ 483: A somewhat more detailed explanation of the five
elements and their qualities. The terms {%vyakta%} and {%avyakta%}
(v. 13931). Salvation, etc., are dependent on self-discipline
({%tapas%}), that is impossible without subduing the senses. The
body is like a chariot, the coachman being the soul, and
the horses the six senses (III, {@211@}).—§ 484: The three
qualities {%sattva, rajas%}, and {%tamas%} (III, {@212@}).—§ 485: The
five vital airs ({%prāṇa, samāna, apāna, udāna, vyāna%}), that
are all seated ({%pratiṣṭhitāḥ%}, v. 13973) in the navel, and by
whose collision the internal fire is generated that digests the
food. The arteries ({%nāḍyaḥ%}), issuing from the heart in all
directions, carry the essence of food ({%annarasān%}) acted upon
by the ten {%prāṇas%}. The perception of the internal spirit,
purification of the heart, destroys the good and evil effects of
actions and leads to eternal beatitude. That state of peace
and purification of heart ({%prasādasya%}, v. 13984) is likened
to the state of a person who in a cheerful state of mind
({%tṛptaḥ%}) sleeps soundly ({%sukhaṃ%}), or to a lamp shining on
a windless spot, well kindled. Community with {%Bráhman%}
cannot be taught to us even by the {%guru%} (v. 13992) (III, {@213@}).
—§ 486: Saying “Thou shalt see by what means I have
attained to this blissful state”, the fowler introduced {%Kauśika%}
to his parents, whom he honoured together with his wife and
children like gods (description; v. 14025: “I do what is
agreeable to them, even though it be not strictly justifiable”)
(III, {@214@}).—The fowler said: “Thou hast wronged thy
father and thy mother, for thou hast left home without their
permission, for the purpose of learning the {%Vedas%}, and they
have become blind from grief at thy loss. Thereby thy
ascetic merit, etc., have become useless to thee. Do return
home this very day.” {%Kauśika%} acknowledged that the
fowler had rescued him when he was on the point of
falling into hell, and that he did not consider him to be
a {%śūdra%}, as it was very difficult for a {%śūdra%} to learn the
eternal religion ({%dharmaḥ%}); his being a {%śūdra%} must surely
be due to any action in a former birth; this {%Kauśika%} wished
to learn.—§ 487: The fowler told: “I was formerly
a {%brahman%}, son of an eminent {%brahman%}, and versed in the
{%Vedas%} and the {%Vedāṅgas%}, and friend of a king, who was
accomplished in the {%Dhanurveda%}, and thence skilled in archery
myself; one day, when I accompanied the king on a hunting
expedition, I killed a {%ṛṣi%}, whom I took for a deer, and was
cursed by him to be born as a fowler in the {%śūdra%} caste
(III, {@215@}); but I prevailed upon him to grant me that
I should remain a pious man and honour my parents, and
thereby attain great perfection ({%siddhiṃ%}), remember my
past life, and again become a {%brahman%}. I took the {%ṛṣi%} to
the hermitage, and he did not die.”—{%Kauśika%} saluted him
respectfully, and having returned home he honoured his old
parents (III, {@216@}).
