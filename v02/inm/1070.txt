{@Badarapācana@}¦ (a tīrtha on the Sarasvatī). § 615 (Bala-
devat.): IX, {@47@}, 2760.—§ 615{%y%}: IX, {@48@}, 2762, 2793, 2812:
There the beautiful {%Śrutāvatī, Bharadvāja's%} daughter, a {%brahma-%}
{%cāriṇī%}, practised austerities for many years, desirous of obtaining
{%Indra%} for her husband. {%Indra%} then came in the guise of
B.-ṛ. {%Vasiṣṭha%}, and told her that everything is attainable by
penances, and asked her to boil five jujubes, when he went
away to mentally recite certain {%mantras%} at {%Indratīrtha%}, that
was not far away. She sat down to boil the jujubes, but in
vain; the day was about to wane; her fuel was all consumed;
then she first thrust her feet into the fire, without changing
a muscle of her face. {%Indra%} then showed himself in his own
proper form, and said that her wish would be accomplished;
throwing off her body, she would live with him in heaven as
his spouse; and this {%tīrtha%} would be the foremost in the world
and be called {%B.%}; he granted her a boon superior to that
granted to {%Arundhatī%} ({%z%}) by {%Mahādeva%}: the person who will
reside in this {%tīrtha%} for only one night and bathe there with
his soul fixed on meditation, will, after having thrown off his
body, obtain many regions of blessedness difficult of acquisition.
Then {%Indra%} went back to heaven; a shower of celestial
flowers poured down, etc., and {%Śrutāvatī%}, throwing off her
body, became the spouse of {%Indra%}.—Cf. Badarīpācana.
