[{@Cyavanopākhyāna(ṃ)@}],¦ “the episode relating to
Cyavana.” § 745{%b%} (Ānuśāsanik.): {%Bhīṣma%} said: In days
past M.-ṛ. {%Cyavana Bhārgava%} set himself for twelve years to
{%udavāsa%} (“dwelling in water”) at the confluence ({%madhye%}) of
the {%Gaṅgā%} and {%Yamunā%}, and stood there like a wooden post
(description). He was caught in the net (description) of
some fishers ({%kaivartāḥ%}) along with a large number of fish,
etc. They were afraid; {%Cyavana%} said that he would either
die with the fishes or be sold with them. With pale faces
the fishers repaired to king {%Nahuṣa%} (XIII, {@50@}), who
immediately went to {%Cyavana%} with his ministers and priest;
{%Cyavana%} asked him to pay the price for himself and the
fishes; {%Nahuṣa%} ordered large sums to be paid to the {%Niṣādas%}
for {%Cyavana%}; but the latter declared that these could not
represent his price, even his whole kingdom; {%Nahuṣa%}
deliberated with his ministers and priests; then there came
an ascetic living in the woods, born of a cow, and said that
the cow was equal in value to the {%brahman%}; this {%Cyavana%}
approved of, as {%svāhā-%} and {%vaṣaṭ-kāra%} are always established
[Page180-b+ 55]
upon kine, etc. {%Cyavana%} accepted the cow from the fisher-
men, and caused them along with the fishes to proceed to
heaven. The two Ṛ. gladdened king {%Nahuṣa%} by granting him
many boons; he accepted the boon that he should himself
remain firm in virtue. The two Ṛ. returned each to his own
asylum, and {%Nahuṣa%} to his city (XIII, {@51@}). Asked by
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} about {%Rāma Jāmadagnya%}, etc. (α), {%Bhīṣma%}
recited an old history of the discourse between {%Cyavana%} and
{%Kuśika%}, i.e. <is>Cyavana-Kuśika-saṃvāda</is> ({%c%}) (III, {@52—56@}).
