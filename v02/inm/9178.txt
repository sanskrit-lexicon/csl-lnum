{@Ṛṣyaśṛṅga@}¦ (B. {%Ṛśya°%}), a muni, son of Vibhāṇḍaka. § 11
(Parvasaṅgr.): I, {@2@}, 443 ({%°sya caritraṃ%}, cf. § 391).—§ 270
(Brahmasabhāv.): II, {@11@}, 440 (in the palace of Brahmán).—
§ 390{%d%} (Tīrthayātrāp.): {%Ṛ.%}, the son of {%Kāśyapa%} (i.e. Vibhāṇ-
ḍaka) born by a hind, caused {%Indra%} to rain during a drought
in the territory of Lomapāda, who gave him his daughter
Śāntā: III, {@110@}, 9991.—§ 391 (do.): III, {@110@}, 9994.—§ 391
(cf. do.). The {%viprarṣi Vibhāṇḍaka Kāśyapa%} practising
austerities near a great lake saw the {%Apsaras Urvaśī%}, whence
his semen fell into the water and was lapped up by a hind, that
was drinking. That hind was a daughter of the gods ({%deva-%}
{%kanyā%}). Brahmán had transformed her into a hind, and when
she had given birth to a {%muni%} she would be freed. She now
gave birth to a son, who was named {%Ṛṣyaśṛṅga%}, because there
was a horn on his head. He passed his days in the forest,
devoted to brahmacarya, and he had never seen any human
being except his father. At that time the king of the {%Aṅgas%},
{%Lomāpāda%}, a friend of {%Daśaratha%}, had been shunned by the
brahmans and was without a {%purohita%}, because he had been
[Page601-b+ 63]
guilty of falsehood towards a brahman and therefore {%Indra%}
did not give rain in his territory. At the advice of a wise
brahman he did atonement for his sins and appeased the
brahmans. Thereafter he assembled his ministers in order to
discuss means for bringing {%Ṛ%}. to his land. According to
their counsel a courtezan with a number of women, etc.,
was sent to {%Ṛ%}. (III, {@110@}). She had constructed a floating
hermitage which she moored at a short distance from {%Vibhāṇ-%}
{%ḍaka's%} hermitage, and then sent her daughter, a courtezan, to
Ṛṣyaśṛṅga. She refused the fruits, foot-washing, etc.,
saying that her religious vows consisted in not receiving such
things, but implied that she might embrace him. By giving
him unsuitable food, garlands, beautiful garments, and
drinks, and by playing and clasping him in her arms, she
made him overpowered with love, and as she went away under
the pretext of performing the {%agnihotra%}, he became sad.
When Vibhāṇḍaka ({%b%}) returned he wondered that {%Ṛ%}. was not
splitting the logs for fuel, etc., and asked who had been there
(III, {@111@}). {%Ṛ%}. said that a religious student ({%brahmacārin%})
had come to him; he had a mass of hair ({%jaṭilaḥ%}) and a pair
of ornaments upon his wrist like his rosary ({%akṣamālā%}); his
matted hair ({%jaṭāḥ%}) was neatly tied up and adhered to the
forehead and was divided in two, etc. He ({%Ṛ.%}) wished to
go to him and see him every day (III, {@112@}). {%Vibhāṇḍaka%}
declared that it was a {%Rākṣasa%}, and in vain spent three days
in searching for this one. When Vibhāṇḍaka had gone out
to collect fruits the courtezans allured {%Ṛ%}. to enter the
bark, which they unmoored, and in this way they brought
him to {%Lomapāda%}, who prepared a beautiful forest named
{%Nāvyāśrama%} (“Floating hermitage”) and kept {%Ṛ%}. in the
female apartments. Suddenly rain poured down. Lomapāda
gave his daughter {%Śāntā%} to {%Ṛ%}. When {%Vibhāṇḍaka%} was
going to {%Campā%} in order to burn the king, the city, and his
whole territory, the king let kine be placed and fields ploughed
along the road, and ordered the cowherds to honour {%Vibhāṇ-%}
{%ḍaka%} with hospitality when he was fatigued and hungry, and
to say that all this belonged to his son and that they were his
slaves. Thus {%Vibhāṇḍaka%} was appeased. According to the
command of his father {%Ṛ.%}, as soon as a son had been born to
him, returned to his father in the wood, and {%Śāntā%} followed
and obeyed him, as {%Indrasenā Nārāyaṇī%} was ever obedient to
{%Mudgala%}, etc. (III, {@113@}): III, {@110@}, 9999, 10000, 10006,
