[{@Hastikūṭa@}]¦ (“the artifice concerning the elephant”). § 757{%b%}
(Ānuśāsanik.): {%Bhīṣma%} said: A brahman {%Gautama%} nursed
an infant elephant that had lost its mother, till it was ten
years old, huge as a hill, etc.; he looked upon it as a son,
and it brought him his fuel and water. {%Indra%}, in the shape
of king {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, seized this young elephant, offering to
give to {%Gautama%} great riches instead; “what use can
brahmans have of elephants?” (†vv. 4850 and 4852—86).
{%Gautama%} said he would take the elephant from him even
in {%[Yamaloka] (c), Mandākinī (d%}), the woods of {%Meru (e%}),
{%Nandana (f), Uttarāḥ Kuravaḥ (g), [Somaloka] (h%}),
{%[Sūryaloka] (i), [Varuṇaloka] (j), [Indraloka] (k), Prājā-%}
{%patyāḥ lokāḥ (l), [Goloka] (m), Svayambhubhavana (n%}),
(† vv. 4896—4902), the world of the {%Somapīthin%} ({%yatropayāti%}
{%haribhiḥ somapīthī%}, B.; C. {%yatropayānti haribhiḥ somavīthīṃ%})
({%o); Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, as regards {%c-k%}, said that he would go to
higher regions, and as regards {%l-n%}, that he would not go (or
be) there; having mentioned ({%o), Gautama%} recognized {%Indra%};
they asked each other's benediction; {%Indra%} returned the
elephant, and as {%Gautama%} alone of all Ṛ. had been able to
recognize him, he took {%Gautama%} and the elephant with him
and proceeded to heaven *(XIII, {@102@}).
