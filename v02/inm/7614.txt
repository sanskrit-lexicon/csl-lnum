{@[Nārāyaṇāstramokṣaparvan(°va)]@}¦ (“the section
including the hurling of the Nārāyaṇa weapon”), the 78th of
the minor parvans of the Mhbhr. § 603. THE LAST PART OF
THE 15TH DAY. After the fall of {%Droṇa%}, the {%Kurus%}, even
{%Duryodhana%}, etc. (α), fled away, {%Kṛtavarman%} with the
remnant of his {%Bhoja%} troops, etc. (β), {%Suśarman%} with the
remnant of the {%Saṃśaptakas%}. Only {%Aśvatthāman%} did not flee:
{%Aśvatthāman%} & {%Śikhaṇḍin%}, etc. (γ). {%Aśvatthāman%} asked
{%Duryodhana%} why the troops were fleeing away, even {%Karṇa's%}
troops; {%Duryodhana%} caused {%Kṛpa%} to inform {%Aśvatthāman%}
of the truth (δ), at which {%Aśvatthāman%} was filled with
rage (VII, {@193@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} asked {%Sañjaya%} what
{%Aśvatthāman%} said (ε), he who knew the weapons of
men and {%Vāruṇa%}, etc. (ζ) (VII, {@194@}). {%Sañjaya%} related:
{%Aśvatthāman%} complained before {%Duryodhana%} that his father
has been killed (η), and vowed to destroy the {%Pāñcālas%} and
the {%Pāṇḍavas%}; neither D., nor G., As., U., Rā., etc., were
able to vanquish him; there were none equal to him and
{%Arjuna%} in knowledge of weapons; he had a weapon (the
{%Nārāyaṇa%} weapon) that neither {%Arjuna%}, etc. (θ) knew, given
by {%Nārāyaṇa%} to his father as a boon, with the promise that
no man should ever be his equal in battle; only, this
weapon must never be used in haste, etc., and never be
hurled upon persons that abandon their chariots or weapons in
battle, etc.; with this he would rout and slay the {%Pāṇḍavas%},
etc. (ι). The {%Kuru%} army rallied; many blew their conches,
etc.; the {%Pāṇḍavas%} took counsel of one another; {%Aśvatthāman%}
touched water and invoked the {%Nārāyaṇa%} weapon (VII,
{@195@}). Fierce omens in nature appeared. D., Dā., and G.
became inspired with fear. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} asked {%Sañjaya%}
what counsel was adopted by the {%Pāṇḍavas%} in order to protect
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} on seeing the retreating {%Kauravas%} once more
advance to battle, rallied by {%Aśvatthāman. Sañjaya%} related:
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} spoke about the matter to {%Arjuna%} (κ), fearing
that it was {%Indra%} himself who was approaching for the sake
of the {%Kauravas. Arjuna%} in reply described the prowess of
{%Aśvatthāman%} and the unrighteousness of the {%Pāṇḍavas%} in
slaying {%Droṇa%} (λ); “all of us have passed the greater part
of our lives; the days that remain to us are few; this
exceedingly unrighteous act has stained that remnant”;
“I did not interfere, as he was about to be slain; for this
fault I have already sunk into hell, overcome with shame”
[Page511-b+ 63]
(VII, {@196@}). {%Bhīmasena%}, reproaching {%Arjuna%}, vindicated the
deed (μ); “I can, with my arrows, rout the united D. with
{%Indra%} at their head, and As., U., and men.” Then
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} spoke in justification of his conduct (ν)
(VII, {@197@}). Asked by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} (ξ), {%Sañjaya%} related:
All the other persons present remained silent; {%Arjuna%}, glancing
obliquely towards {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, seemed to reproach him
with tears and sighs; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (ο) stood ashamed;
{%Sātyaki%} wrathfully rebuked {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} (π). {%Dhṛṣṭa-%}
{%dyumna%} in reply taunted {%Sātyaki%} with the slaughter of
{%Bhūriśrasas%} (ρ). {%Sātyaki%} rushed towards {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}
in order to slay him; {%Bhīma%}, urged by {%Kṛṣṇa%}, held him
back; {%Sahadeva%} endeavoured to bring about a reconciliation
(σ); {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} asked {%Bhīma%} to let him slay {%Sātyaki%}
(τ); then he or {%Arjuna%} would slay the enemies. {%Kṛṣṇa%} and
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} restored peace with great difficulty, and all
the warriors proceeded to battle (VII, {@198@}). {%Aśvatthāman%}
caused a great carnage among the {%Pāṇḍava%} troops (description);
before {%Duryodhana%} he repeated his vow (υ). {%Duryodhana%}
rallied his troops. {%Aśvatthāman%} invoked the {%Nārāyaṇa%}
weapon (description). The {%Pāṇḍavas%}, etc. (ϕ), became
exceedingly agitated. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, relying on {%Kṛṣṇa%},
advised {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} to flee away with his {%Pāñcālas%},
and {%Sātyaki%} with the {%Vṛṣṇis%} and {%Andhakas%}; he and his
brothers would ascend a funeral pile (χ). {%Kṛṣṇa%} prevailed
upon the troops to lay down their weapons and alight from
their chariots. {%Bhīmasena%} alone refused to do so, and dissuaded
the others (ψ). {%Arjuna%} said that his vow was that the
{%Gāṇḍīva%} should not be used against the {%Nārāyaṇa%} weapon,
kine, and brahmans. {%Bhīma%} attacked {%Aśvatthāman%}, but was
overwhelmed by the energy of the {%Nārāyaṇa%} weapon
(VII, {@199@}). {%Arjuna%} covered {%Bhīmasena%} with the {%Vāruṇa%}
weapon, {%Arjuna%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%}, alighting from their chariot,
proceeded on foot towards {%Bhīma%} and forcibly brought him
down from his chariot, making him abandon his weapons.
Then the {%Nārāyaṇa%} weapon became neutralized; all the
quarters became clear, etc. The {%Pāṇḍava%} host stood arrayed
once more. {%Duryodhana%} urged {%Aśvatthāman%} to use the
same weapon once more; {%Aśvatthāman%} said that it could
not be used twice; if brought back it would without doubt
slay himself. {%Duryodhana%} then urged him to slay the
enemies with other weapons. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} asked, what then
came to pass (ω); {%Sañjaya%} related: {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} &
{%Aśvatthāman%}, who deprived {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} of his steeds,
driver, and chariot; the {%Pāñcālas%} fled away. {%Sātyaki%} &
{%Aśvatthāman%}, who was worsted by him. {%Duryodhana%}, etc.
(αα), & {%Sātyaki%}, who made them flee away deprived of their
chariots. {%Aśvatthāman%} (upon another chariot) & {%Sātyaki%},
who once more deprived him of his chariot and caused him
to retreat; the {%Pāṇḍavas%} blew their conches, and {%Sātyaki%} slew
300 of {%Vṛṣasena's%} division, etc. (αα). {%Aśvatthāman%} (upon
another chariot) & {%Sātyaki; Aśvatthāman%} repeated his vow
(ββ); {%Sātyaki%} was carried away by his driver. {%Aśvatthāman%}
& {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, who was much afflicted; {%Arjuna%}, etc.
(γγ), & {%Aśvatthāman%}, who slew {%Sudarśana%} (the {%Mālava%}
king), {%Paurava (Bṛhatkṣattra%}), and the young {%Cedi%} prince.
{%Bhīma%} & {%Aśvatthāman; Bhīma%} was carried away by his
steeds; the {%Pāñcālas%} fled away (VII, {@200@}). {%Arjuna%}
({%+ Kṛṣṇa%}) (rallying his troops) & {%Aśvatthāman%} (+ the
{%Kauravas%}); {%Arjuna%} addressed {%Aśvatthāman%} in harsh words
(δδ). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} asked {%Sañjaya%} about the cause of this, as
{%Arjuna%} and {%Aśvatthāman%} loved each other. {%Sañjaya%} said
that it was in consequence of his grief (εε). {%Aśvatthāman%}
[Page512-a+ 63]
became angry with {%Arjuna%} and especially with {%Kṛṣṇa%},
touched water, and made use of the {%Āgneya%} weapon, from
which dire omens in nature appeared, and a great slaughter
in the {%Pāṇḍava%} army resulted; Rā. and Pś. uttered fierce
cries, etc. (description). {%Arjuna%} invoked the {%Brāhma%} weapon:
the darkness was dispelled, etc.; a full {%akṣauhiṇī%} of the
{%Pāṇḍava%} troops had been killed; {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%} were
unwounded; the {%Pāṇḍavas%} rejoiced, the {%Kauravas%} wondered,
{%Aśvatthāman%} was disconsolate, and ran away from the fight;
he met {%Vyāsa%}, and asked him the reason; “neither As., nor
G., Pś., Rā., U., Y., and birds, nor men can baffle this
weapon.” {%Vyāsa%} told him the story of {%Nārāyaṇa%} ({%b%});
{%Nara%} and {%Nārāyaṇa%} are {%Arjuna%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%}; even {%Aśvatthā—%}
{%man%} has been born as a portion of {%Rudra%}, and was [in a former
birth] endued with great wisdom, regarding the universe to
consist only of {%Mahādeva%}, etc., and {%Śiva%} had granted him
numerous boons, and he had, in every {%Yuga%}, adored the
great god in his {%Phallic%} form. {%Kṛṣṇa%} had sprung from
{%Rudra%} himself, and always worshipped him, regarding his
{%Phallic%} emblem as the origin of the universe, and he viewed
the identity of {%Bráhman%} with the universe; D., Si., and
M.-ṛ. adore {%Kṛṣṇa%} in order to attain to {%Mahādeva; Kṛṣṇa%}
is the Creator of everything; the eternal {%Kṛṣṇa%} should be
adored with sacrifices, etc. {%Aśvatthāman%} bowed unto {%Rudra%},
regarded {%Kṛṣṇa%} as worthy of the highest regards, and
became filled with delight, the marks whereof appeared on
his body. Bowing to {%Vyāsa%}, he caused the army to be
withdrawn, and so did also the {%Pāṇḍavas%}. Having fought
for five days…,{%Droṇa%} repaired to {%Brahmaloka%} (VII, {@201@}).
{%Arjuna%} met with {%Vyāsa%} and inquired of him about the
invisible person who aided him in the battle; {%Vyāsa%} said
that it was {%Mahādeva%} himself, and recited a long enumeration
of his attributes (ηη); if {%Mahādeva%} becomes angry, neither
D., nor As., G., Rā., even if they hide themselves in deep
caves, can have peace. In days of yore {%Mahādeva%} destroyed
the sacrifice of {%Dakṣa%}; the {%Sacrifice%} fled away, and D. and
As. fell down and submitted to {%Mahādeva%}, the {%Nāgas%} and Ṛ.
became agitated, etc.; {%Pūṣan%} was eating the {%puroḍāśa%}:
{%Śiva%} tore out his teeth; the gods assigned to {%Rudra%} a
substantial share in sacrifices; he then re-established the
sacrifice. Then {%Vyāsa%} related the destruction of {%Tripura (d%}).
He [{%Śiva%}] is {%Rudra%}, etc. (ιι). Explanation of some of the
names of {%Mahādeva%} (κκ). Blessings upon the reader,
especially the readers of the {%Śatarudriya%} (λλ) (VII, {@202@}).
