{@Kirmīravadhaparvan(°va)@}¦ (“the section relating to
the killing of Kirmīra,” the 31st of the minor parvans of
Mhbhr.; cf. Kirmīravadha). § 316: {%Vidura%} had heard it from
the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and now related it to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}. Departing
from {%Hāstinapura%} and travelling for three days and nights
the {%Pāṇḍavas%} reached the {%Kāmyaka%} wood. At midnight
a man-eating {%rākṣasa, Kirmīra%}, brother of {%Baka%} and friend
of {%Hiḍimba%}, obstructed their path with a lighted brand, and
would avenge himself on {%Bhīma. Kṛṣṇā%} was afraid.
{%Dhaumya%} destroyed his illusion by {%rākṣasa%}-destroying
[Page409-a+ 63]
{%mantras. Arjuna%} stringed his bow {%Gāṇḍīva%}; but {%Bhīma%}, making
him desist, fought with trees, etc., against {%Kirmīra%}, as the
brothers {%Vāli%} and {%Sugrīva%} had done of yore for the sake of the
same woman. At last {%Bhīma%} seized him with his arms and
whirled him about and killed him. Then placing {%Kṛṣṇā%} in their
front they set out for {%Dvaitavana%}. Having cleared the forest
of its pest they began to live there. “Passing through the
forest, I saw the body of the {%rākṣasa%}, and heard the story
from the brahmans” (III, {@11@}).
