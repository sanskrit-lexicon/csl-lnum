{@Brahmadatta-Pūjanī-Saṃvāda(ḥ)@}¦ (“conversation
between Br. and P.”). § 647{%b%}: XII, {@139@}: {%As Bhīṣma%}
had said that from trust great danger arose to kings
{%Yudhiṣthira%} asked: “But how would the king maintain
[Page155-a+ 63]
himself if he were not to trust anybody?” {%Bhīṣma%} related:
A bird named {%Pūjanī%} lived with king {%Brahmadatta%} in his
palace at {%Kāmpilya%}; like [the bird] {%Jīvajīvaka%}, it could
mimic the cries of all animals ({%rutajñā sarvabhūtānāṃ%}), etc.
At one and the same time P. got an offspring and the king
a son. P. used every day to go to the shores of the ocean and
bring a couple of fruits, one for her own child and one for the
prince. One day the prince, when playing with the offspring
of P., killed it, and then came back to his nurse. When
P. had returned to the palace, she wept bitterly, and said
that nobody should live with a kṣattriya or make friends
with him; for so long as it suits their purpose, they behave
with courtesy; but then they throw off the instrument; they
do evil to all, and should never be trusted; even after doing
an injury they try to soothe. P. then pierced the eyes of the
prince, saying that those who avenge an injury never lose
their merit by such conduct. Thinking that the avenger only
squares his account, Br. sought to prevail upon P. to remain;
“even after a deadly injury, affection and mutual trust arise
between two persons residing together (for instance, the {%śvapaca%}
[{%cāṇḍāla%}, PCR.] and the dog); animosity disappears quickly,
like water poured upon the leaf of a lotus; it is Time that
does every act; who therefore injures whom? Like fire con-
suming the fuel, Time consumes all creatures; what thou
hast done, has been forgiven by me, do thou also forgive me.”
P. maintained that the injurer ought to leave his old place
and never to place his trust upon the injured; just as the
fragments of an earthen vessel cannot be reunited; animosity
destroys the very sons and grandsons, and thereby the parties
lose the next world as well; animosity can never die; it lies
hidden like fire in wood, or like the water-fire ({%toyāgniḥ%},
i.e. the Aurva-fire) in the ocean; amongst men that have
injured one another, therefore, mistrust alone can produce
happiness; nor should too much trust be placed upon a person
deserving of trust; one should try to inspire others with
confidence in one's self, but never repose confidence in others
(not even in a wife, son, brother, or friend); the mind of
a person who has once injured another becomes naturally
filled with mistrust if he sees the injured person worshipping
him with gifts and honours. Hostility springs from five causes:
woman, land, [harsh] words, natural incompatibility ({%sāpatna%},
i.e. {%jāti-vairaṃ%}, [as] that between the cat and the mouse,
Nīl.), and injury; if Time be the cause of all acts, why
do friends and kinsmen seek to avenge each other? further,
why did the gods and the Asuras, in days of yore, smite
each other in battle? and what use would there be of
medicines? and how could religious merit be acquired by
persons performing religious acts ({%kasmād dharmo 'sti kartṛṣu)?%}
Men wish for birds either [to kill them] for food or [to
keep them in cages] for sport. Misery arises from various
sources (decrepitude, loss of wealth, association with something
disagreeable, separation from agreeable objects, death {%[badha]%},
immurement {%[bandha]%}, women, natural causes {%[sahajaṃ]%},
[especially the death of] a son; foolish persons say that
there is no misery in others' misery; but one that knows
the flavour of all [sorts of] misery ({%rasajñaḥ sarvaduḥkhasya%}),
feels the misery of others as his own; [we have this] decision
in [our] own practical scriptures, and [according to them]
trust is productive of misery ({%niścayah svārthaśāstreṣu, viśvāsaś%}
{%cāsukhodayaḥ%}; ought we not to read {%°yaś cārtha°?%}), and Uśanas
did formerly quote two verses ({%gāthe%}) [to this effect] to
Prahlāda ({%b%}); those who trust [the word], true or false, of a foe,
are killed by trusting ({%śraddadhānās%}) like [a seeker of] honey
[Page155-b+ 63]
by dry grass; having conceived ({%upagṛhya%}) hostilities [people]
soothe [their foe], then they dash upon him like a full jar upon
stone; if a king does injury to anyone, he should never trust
him again. As Br. objected that by mere mistrust one does
not obtain his desires, but is like a dead person, P. maintained
that it is necessary not to act without an eye to the
consequences (for instance, of sore feet, sore eyes, a wicked
path, want of rain, injurious food); destiny and exertion
are depending upon each other ({%daivaṃ puruṣakāraś ca%}
{%sthitāv anyonyasaṃśrayāt%}); but those that are high-minded
achieve good feats, while eunuchs only pay court to Destiny;
knowledge, courage, cleverness, strength, and patience are
one's natural ({%sahajāni%}) friends; house, precious metals
({%kupyaṃ%}), land ({%kṣetraṃ%}), wife, and friends are secondary
({%upahitāni%}) and may be obtained everywhere; home-keeping
persons ({%gṛhasnehāvabaddhānāṃ%}) of little understanding are
eaten up by a bad wife like the crab by her progeny ({%mā-%}
{%ghamāṃ segavā%}—C. {%śe°—iva%}, 89 = 5222, v. Nīl.); one should
put a distance between oneself and a bad wife, a bad son, a bad
king, a bad friend, a bad alliance ({%ku-sambandhaṃ%}), and a bad
country; she only is a wife who speaks what is agreeable;
he is a son who makes his sire happy; he is a friend in
whom one can trust; that is one's country where one earns
one's living; he is a king of strict rule who does not oppress,
etc. (95—96 = 5229—5230); the king is the root of the triple
aggregate ({%trivargasya%}, i.e. Virtue, Wealth, and Pleasure);
while taking from his subjects a sixth share of their wealth,
he should protect them all; otherwise he is a thief, and
takes upon himself the sins of all his subjects, and ultimately
sinks into Hell ({%nirayaṃ prayāti%}); the king, on the other
hand, who gives protection is said by the Prajāpati {%Manu%}
to have seven attributes ({%guṇān%}): he is a father (by
compassion; the man who does not behave rightly towards
him takes birth [in the next life] as an animal—{%tiryag%}
{%gacchati%}), a mother (by doing good to his subjects—{%sam-%}
{%bhāvayati%}—and by cherishing the poor—{%dīnam apy upapadyate%}),
a preceptor ({%guru%}) (by giving instruction in morality and
virtue—{%dharmopadeśena%}), a protector, fire (by scorching the
wicked—{%aniṣṭān%}), {%Vaiśravaṇa%} (i.e. Kubera) (by making
gifts of wealth to those that are dear to him—{%iṣṭeṣu%}), and
{%Yama%} (by restraining the sinful—{%yamayann asataḥ%}) ({%c%}); that
king, whose subjects grow like a large lotus in a lake, obtains
every reward [here] and meets with honour in Heaven
({%Svargaloke mahīyate%}).—Then P. took leave of Br. and pro-
ceeded to the region she chose.
