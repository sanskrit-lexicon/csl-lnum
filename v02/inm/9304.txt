[{@Sainyaniryāṇaparvan(°va)@}]¦ (“the section relating
to the marching out of the troops,” the 63rd of the minor
parvans of Mhbhr.; cf. Sainyaniryāṇa). § 570: The {%Pāṇḍavas%}
had seven {%akṣauhiṇīs%} led by {%Drupada%}, etc. (α). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
consulted with his brothers about the election of a general-
issimo, who might also withstand {%Bhīṣma. Sahadeva%}, etc.,
proposed {%Virāṭa%}, etc. (β). {%Kṛṣṇa%} named {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%},
who was elected. Then they marched out to {%Kurukṣetra%}
(description), with {%Bhīma%} in the van, etc. (γ). {%Draupadī%}
with her ladies, etc., remained at {%Upaplavya%}. The {%Kekaya%}
princes, etc. (δ) marched behind {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, keeping
him in their centre. In the rear were {%Virāṭa%}, etc. (ε),
40,000 chariots, etc. {%Anādhṛṣṭi%}, etc. (ζ) marched
surrounding {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%}. Entering {%Kurukṣetra%},
they blew their conches, also {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%};
{%Pāñcajanya%} filled them with joy (V, {@152@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
encamped on {%Kurukṣetra. Kṛṣṇa%}, etc. (η) each did some
special work. At the holy {%Hiraṇvatī%} (an excellent {%tīrtha%},
with sacred water, without pointed pebbles and mire),
{%Kṛṣṇa%} caused a moat to be excavated. There were
assembled hundreds upon hundreds of skilled mechanics in
receipt of regular wages, and surgeons and physicians, etc.
Then their allies began to march thither (V, {@152@}). When
{%Kṛṣṇa%} had departed, {%Duryodhana%} urged {%Kaṛna, Duḥśāsana%},
and {%Śakuni%} to make preparations for battle, which was fixed
to commence the next morning (I, {@153@}). At the request of
{%Yudhiṣṭhira, Kṛṣṇa%} related {%Duryodhana's%}, etc., project of
imprisoning him; “neither {%Bhīṣma%} nor {%Droṇa%} said any-
thing on that subject; indeed, all of them follow {%Duryodhana%},
except {%Vidura…%} War is that which should now take
place.” {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} gave order to array the troops, but
then he complained that he should slay his preceptors, etc.
{%Arjuna%} reminded him of what {%Kuntī%} and {%Vidura%} had said
through {%Kṛṣṇa%}, and {%Kṛṣṇa%} affirmed it. The {%Pāṇḍavas%} and
their soldiers passed the night in great happiness (V, {@154@}).
After that night had passed away, {%Duryodhana%} arranged his
eleven {%akṣauhiṇīs%} (description), under {%Kṛpa%}, etc. (θ)
(V, {@155@}). Referring to a contest between the {%brahmans%},
whom also the {%vaiśyas%} and the {%śūdras%} followed, and the
[Page608-b+ 63]
{%kṣatriyas%} among the {%Haihayas (b), Duryodhana%} urged
{%Bhīṣma%} to become their generalissimo. {%Bhīṣma%} said that
he did not see upon earth the warrior that was equal to
him, except {%Arjuna%}; but {%Arjuna%} would never openly fight
with him; {%Bhīṣma%} said he could, in a trice, destroy the
universe with D., As., Rā., and men; but the {%Pāṇḍavas%} he
could not exterminate; but he would slay every day
10,000; and either {%Karṇa%} or {%Bhīṣma%} should fight first.
{%Karṇa%} declared he would not fight before {%Bhīṣma%} was slain;
then he would fight with {%Arjuna%}. Then {%Bhīṣma%} was
solemnly installed, under a bloody shower, etc. Then they
marched out to {%Kurukṣetra%}, and {%Duryodhana%} and {%Karṇa%}
caused the camps to be measured out on a level part of the
plain (V, {@156@}). When {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} heard that {%Bhīṣma%}
had been installed in the command of the {%Kuru%} army, he
summoned his brothers and {%Vāsudeva%}, and selected seven
leaders for his seven {%akṣauhiṇīs: Drupada%}, etc. (ι) (cf. α!),
and above them all {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}; and {%Dhanañjaya%}
(i.e. {%Arjuna%}) of curly hair was made the leader of all those
leaders; and {%Kṛṣṇa%} the leader of {%Arjuna%} and driver of his
steeds. {%Halāyudha%} (i.e. {%Balarāma%}), etc. (κ) came there, and
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (λ) rose from their seats and offered
worship to {%Halāyudha. Halāyudha%} said that a fierce
slaughter was inevitable, that the {%Pāṇḍavas%} would certainly
win because of the help of {%Kṛṣṇa%}, that he had repeatedly
tried to prevail upon {%Kṛṣṇa%} to remain neuter; that he
would himself do; but as he could not be without {%Kṛṣṇa%},
he would repair to the {%tīrthas%} of the {%Sarasvatī%}. Then he set
out for his {%tīrthayātrā%} (V, {@157@}). About this time there
came to the {%Pāṇḍava%} camp {%Bhīṣmaka's (c%}) son {%Rukmin (d%}).
He entered the camp with an {%akṣauhiṇī%} of troops, from
desire of doing what was agreeable to {%Vāsudeva%}. He offered
{%Arjuna%} his assistance, if he was afraid. He would slay
everyone: {%Droṇa%}, etc. (μ). {%Arjuna%}, mentioning his exploits
against the {%G.%}, at {%Khāṇḍava%}, against the {%Nivātakavacas%} and
{%Kālakeyas%}, at {%Virāṭa's%} city, and that he had paid his respects
for battle's sake to {%Rudra%}, etc. (ν), would not say he was
afraid. {%Rakmin%} then went to {%Duryodhana%}, saying the same
words, and was rejected in the same way. Then the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} again consulted, presided over by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
(V, {@158@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} asked {%Sañjaya%} to tell him all that
had happened in the matter of encamping, and complained
that though he understood the defects, he could not with-
stand {%Duryodhana. Sañjaya%} said that he ought not to impute
the fault only to {%Duryodhana%}: “as to our acts, some say
that everything is ordained by God; some that they are the
result of free-will; others that they are the result of those
of our past lives” (V, {@159@}).
