{@Hayagrīva@}<sup>3</sup>,¦ an ancient king. § 628{%b%} (Rājadh.): The
ancient king {%H.%}, after having slain a large number of his foes
in battle, was himself defeated and slain, being once without
a follower at his side. He acquired great fame from the
battles he fought. This was his sacrifice, and having com-
pleted it by yielding up his life-breaths, he is now sporting
in the regions of the gods. He protected his kingdom,
performed sacrifices, was possessed of learning, etc. He
drank soma in the sacrifices, gratified the brahmans, etc.,
therefore he won heaven: XII, {@24@}, 720 ({%rājarṣeḥ%}).
