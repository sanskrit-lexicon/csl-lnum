[{@Vṛtra-vadha(ḥ)@}]¦ (“the killing of Vṛtra”): § 693{%b%}
(Mokṣadh.). {%Bhīṣma%} said: In days of yore, {%Indra%}, accom-
panied by the celestial forces, proceeded in his chariot, and
beheld As: {%Vṛtra%}, stationed before him like a mountain,
500 {%yojanas%} in height and 300 in circumference. {%Indra%} was
struck with palsy in the lower extremities. On the eve of
that great battle between D. and As. there arose loud shouts
from both sides, etc. {%Vṛtra%} felt neither awe nor fear. Then
the encounter commenced; the entire welkin was enveloped
by the combatants of both sides; all the gods with {%Brahmán%},
and Ṛ., Si., G., and Aps. on their chariots had assembled in
order to see the battle. {%Vṛtra%} shot rocks, the gods arrows;
{%Vṛtra%} employed illusion; {%Indra%} was stupefied; {%Vasiṣṭha%}
restored him to his senses by the {%Rathantara%}, pointing out
to him {%Brahmán%}, etc. (α). {%Indra%}, by {%yoga%}, dispelled the
illusions of {%Vṛtra. Bṛhaspati%} (the son of {%Aṅgiras%}) and Ṛ.
repaired to {%Śiva%}, whose energy became a fever and penetrated
{%Vṛtra; Viṣṇu%} entered the thunderbolt of {%Indra; Bṛhaspati%},
{%Vasiṣṭha%}, and Ṛ. urged {%Indra%} to slay {%Vṛtra%}, and so did {%Śiva%},
saying that {%Vṛtra%} was the soul of the universe, capable of
going everywhere; for 60,000 years {%Vṛtra%} had practised
penances in order to obtain strength; {%Brahmán%} had given
him the boons he had solicited: the greatness of {%yogins%}, large
powers of illusions, excess of might, etc.; {%Śiva%} told {%Indra%} to
slay him with {%yoga%}, and imparted to him his own energy.
D. and Ṛ. uttered loud cheers, etc. Suddenly all As. were
afflicted with the loss of memory; in a trice their powers of
illusion also disappeared. Ṛ. and D. praised {%Śakra%} and {%Śiva%}
(XII, {@282@}). Description of the symptoms that appeared on
the body of {%Vṛtra%} when he was overtaken by that fever;
His memory issued out of his mouth in form of a dreadful
jackal. Inauspicious omens. {%Indra%} looked hard at him; {%Vṛtra%}
yawned and uttered superhuman cries; while {%Vṛtra%} was
yawning {%Indra%} hurled his thunderbolt at him and slew him;
[XII, {@287@}, 58 ff. = 10,267 ff.: the thunderbolt cut {%Vṛtra%}
into two halves; {%Vṛtra%} then came to the highest region of
{%Viṣṇu%}, for it was by his devotion to {%Viṣṇu%} that he had
overwhelmed the universe]; then {%Indra%} entered heaven with
that thunderbolt pervaded by {%Viṣṇu%}. Then {%Brahmavadhyā%}
(description) issued out of the body of the slain {%Vṛtra%}.
[Page757-b+ 63]
A little while after, when {%Indra%} was proceeding towards
heaven, she seized him and stuck to him. {%Indra%} entered the
fibres of a lotus stalk and dwelt there for many years. But
{%Brahmavadhyā%} pursued him closely, and deprived him of all
his energy. At last he repaired to {%Brahmán%}, who made her
leave {%Indra%} by apportioning one quarter to {%Agni%} (whence it
should enter him who did not offer oblations of seed, etc. to
{%Agni%}); one quarter to the trees, herbs, and all kinds of grass
(whence it should possess the men who would cut or tear any
of them at {%parvan%}-days); one quarter to the {%Apsarases%}
(whence it should possess that man who would cohabit
with women during their courses); and one quarter to the
waters (whence it should possess that man who would cast
into the waters phlegm and urine and excrements). With
{%Brahmán's%} permission {%Indra%} then performed a horse-sacrifice
and thereby became cleansed, regained his prosperity, and
slew thousands of foes. From the blood of {%Vṛtra%} were born
the {%śikhaṇḍāḥ%} (the crests of cocks (?) or name of a plant,
BR.), which, for this reason, must not be eaten by the twice-
born classes, etc. Blessing upon the reciter (XII, {@283@}).
