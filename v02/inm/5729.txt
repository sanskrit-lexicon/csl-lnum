{@[Khāṇḍavadahanaparvan(°va)]@},¦ the 19th of the minor
parvans, in {%C.%}, including also Mayadarśanaparvan, in all
I, {@222—34@} (cf. Khāṇḍavadāha). § 254: At the instance of
Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Bhīṣma the Pāṇḍavas at Indraprastha
began to bring other kings under their sway. All the
subjects lived happily. Once, in the summer, Arjuna and
Kṛṣṇa sported on the banks of the Yamunā with Draupadī
and Subhadrā, etc. They were then approached by a brahman,
whose complexion was like molten gold (I, {@222@}). It was
Agni. He asked them to help him to consume the forest
of Khāṇḍava and the creatures therein; for Indra always
prevented him from consuming it, because he was a friend of
the Nāga Takṣaka, who dwelt there with his followers and
family.—§§ 255—6, {%a%} (Agniparābhava, q.v.): the antecedents
of the Khāṇḍavad. (I, {@223, 224@}).—§ 256, {%b%}: Arjuna said
that he wanted a stronger bow and inexhaustible arrows, and
a resplendent chariot to ride in, and that Kṛṣṇa needed a
weapon with which he could slay Nāgas and Piśācas (I, {@224@}).
—§ 257: Then Agni thought of Varuṇa ({%b%}), who presented
Arjuna with: (1) the Gāṇḍīva bow ({%c%}); (2) two inexhaustible
[Page406-a+ 63]
quivers; (3) a chariot yoked with horses. Then Agni gave to
Kṛṣṇa: (1) a discus (Sudarśana) ({%d%}). Varuṇa, after this,
gave to Kṛṣṇa: (2) the mace Kaumodakī ({%e%}). They were
then ready to fight, and Agni began to consume the forest
(I, {@225@}).—§ 258: Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa prevented the creatures
from escaping. Even the gods became afraid and applied to
Indra. Indra poured down showers of rain, that were at
first dried up in the sky by the heat of the fire (I, {@226@}).
When more rain was poured down, Arjuna dispelled it with
a shower of his weapons. Takṣaka was not present, having
gone to Kurukṣetra. But his son Aśvasena was there; his
mother, a she-snake, attempted to swallow him, but had her
head cut off by Arjuna; Indra, raising a violent wind,
for a moment deprived Arjuna of his consciousness, during
which time Aśvasena effected his escape, being cursed by
Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna, and Agni (“never shalt thou be famous”).
Indra assailed Arjuna with clouds, which were dispersed by
the Vāyavya weapon, and with a shower of stones, and with
a peak from the Mandara, but in vain. Garutmat (Garuḍa)
and other birds, and Nāgas, who also assailed Kṛṣṇa and
Arjuna, were vanquished; and As., G., Y., Rā., and Nāgas
were defeated by Arjuna, as were the Dai. and Dā. by
Kṛṣṇa with his discus. They were also attacked by Yama
with his death-dealing mace, Kubera with his spiked club,
Varuṇa with his noose and beautiful missile, Skanda with his
long lance, the Aśvins with resplendent plants, Dhātṛ with
his bow, Jaya with a thick club, Tvaṣṭṛ with a huge
mountain, Sūrya with a bright śakti, Mṛtyu with a battle-
axe, Aryaman with a bludgeon furnished with sharp spikes,
Mitra with a discus sharp as a razor, Pūṣan, Bhaga, Savitṛ,
R., V., M., V.-D., and S. (I, {@227@}). With his discus Kṛṣṇa
slaughtered Pś., N., Rā., Dā., As., etc. The gods retired from
the scene. Indra became filled with joy and applauded
Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna. An incorporeal voice addressed him,
saying that Takṣaka was in Kurukṣetra, and that Kṛṣṇa
and Arjuna, being the old ṛṣis and gods Nara and Nārā-
yaṇa, were invincible, and that the destruction of the forest
of Khāṇḍava had been ordained by fate. Then also Indra
went back to heaven. The Vidyādharas, etc., dwelling in
that forest, all became frightened. Agni, drinking the nectar-
like stream of animal fat, became filled with joy. When the
Asura Maya, the brother of Namuci, was about to be slain by
Kṛṣṇa and burnt by Agni, Arjuna rescued him. Agni
burnt the forest for fifteen days, sparing only six of its
dwellers: Aśvasena, Maya, and four śārṅgakas (a sort of
birds, Nīl.) (I, {@228@}).—§ 259 (Śārṅgakopākhyāna, q.v.):
I, {@229@}, 1-{@234@}, 4, (8331—8464).—§ 260: When Agni had
consumed fat, marrow, and flesh in abundance, and burnt the
forest for fifteen days, he became gratified and extinguished
himself. Indra, with M., appeared before Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna,
and granted them a boon. Arjuna asked him to give him all
his weapons (both the Āgneya and the Vāyavya), and Indra
promised to give them when Mahādeva had been pleased
with him. To Kṛṣṇa he granted that his friendship with
Arjuna should be eternal. Then he ascended to heaven with
the celestials. Arjuna, Vāsudeva, and the Dānava Maya,
having wandered a little, sat down on the bank of a river
(I, {@234@}).
