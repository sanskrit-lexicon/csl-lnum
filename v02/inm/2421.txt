devat.): Here {%Baladeva%} beheld a gigantic tree, {%Mahāśaṅkha%},
tall as {%Meru%}, looking like {%Śvetaparvata%}, and resorted to by
many Ṛ.; there dwell Y., Vd., Rā., Pś., and Si., in thousands;
all of them, abandoning other kinds of food, observe vows and
regulations, and take at due seasons the fruits of that tree for
their sustenance, and wander unseen by men: IX, {@37@}, 2137.
