[{@Sanatsujātaparvan(°va)@}]¦ (“the section relating to
Sanatsujāta,” the 60th of the minor parvans of the Mhbhr.;
cf. Sānatsujāta). § 560: As {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} wished to hear
more, {%Vidura%}, as he was born in the {%Śūdra%} order, did not
venture to say more himself, but he thought of that ancient
and eternal {%Ṛṣi%} who, leading a life of perpetual celibacy,
had said that there is no death. The {%Ṛṣi%} came (V, {@41@}),
was questioned by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, and discoursed upon death,
the efficacy of religious acts, etc. (V, {@42—46@}).
