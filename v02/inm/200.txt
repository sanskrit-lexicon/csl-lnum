<is>Janamejaya</is> was installed in the snake-sacrifice, <is>Kṛṣṇa</is>
<is>Dvaipāyana</is> went thither (his birth, growth, studies,
dividing the <is>Vedas</is> into four parts, and his begetting of
<is>Pāṇḍu</is>, etc., are mentioned) with his disciples, and asked by
Janamejaya about the <is>Kurus</is> and <is>Pāṇḍavas</is>, he directed
his disciple <is>Vaiśampāyana</is> to tell their story.

describes its virtues (v. 2320: {%Bhāratānaṃ mahaj janma%}
{%Mahābhāratam ucyate%}); <is>Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana</is> had attained
his object in three years, rising daily and purifying himself
and performing his ascetic devotions he had composed this

one that asks for it does indeed make a present of the whole
earth with her belt of seas. {%Vide%} Ādivaṃśāvatāraṇa.

from the kṣattriya ladies and the brahmans. Description

defeated by the <is>Ādityas</is> and deprived of heaven, the
<is>Asuras</is> began to be born on Earth in such numbers that
the Earth became incapable of supporting herself, even with
the united strength of the <is>Pannagas</is> ({%bhūtasattvaughaḥ%}).
The Earth then applied to <is>Brahmán</is>, who was surrounded
by gods, brahmans, great Ṛṣis, Gandharvas, and Apsarases.
Brahmán appointed the gods, Gandharvas and Apsarases, to
be born on Earth in order to ease her of her burthen
by destroying the Asuras. They agreed, and going to
<is>Vaikuṇṭha</is> they also prevailed upon <is>Nārāyaṇa</is> to become
incarnate.
