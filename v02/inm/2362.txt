§ 10 (Parvas.): I, {@2@}, 346.—§ 609: Requested by {%Janame-%}
{%jaya%} (α), {%Vaiśampāyana%} related {%Duryodhana's%} grief at {%Karṇa's%}
slaughter, his resolution to continue the battle, his making
{%Śalya%} the commander of the army; that {%Śalya%}, having made
a great carnage, was slain by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} at midnight; that
{%Duryodhana%} fled away from the field, penetrated into a lake,
and in the afternoon was summoned and slain by {%Bhīmasena%},
who had caused the lake to be encompassed by many warriors;
that {%Aśvatthāman%}, etc. (β), slaughtered the {%Pāñcāla%} troops in
the night; that {%Sañjaya%}, next morning, having set out from
the camp, entered the city; the grief of the citizens upon
hearing {%Duryodhana's%} fall; that {%Sañjaya%} informed {%Dhṛta-%}
{%rāṣṭra%} (γ) (“on the side of the {%Pāṇḍavas%} 7 are alive, amongst
the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%} 3”) (δ); {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%}, etc. (ε), grief;
that {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} ordered {%Vidura%} to let the ladies and
{%Gāndhārī%} retire, and was comforted by {%Vidura%} (IX, {@1@});
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} lament and how he asked {%Sañjaya%} about the
battle (ζ) (IX, {@2@}). {%Sañjaya%} begins his narration.—§ 610:
The fear of the {%Kurus%} after the fall of {%Karṇa%}, and the
state of the {%Kuru%} army (η); {%Duryodhana's%} resolution to
resist the victors (θ); {%Bhīma%} and {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} caused
[Page190-b+ 63]
a great carnage; {%Arjuna%} proceeded towards the car-division;
{%Nakula%}, etc. (ι), & {%Śakuni%}; 25,000 foot-soldiers & {%Arjuna%};
they were slain by {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna (b%}) and {%Bhīma%}; the {%Kuru%}
army broke and fled away; {%Cekitāna%}, etc. (κ), having slain
a large number, blew their conchs; {%Arjuna%} attacked the
rest; they fled; {%Duryodhana%} & the {%Pāṇḍavas; Duryo-%}
{%dhana%} rallied his troops (λ); {%Duryodhana%} (+ all his troops)
& the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (headed by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}) (IX, {@3@}). {%Kṛpa%}
urged {%Duryodhana%} to make peace (μ) (IX, {@4@}); {%Duryodhana%}
refused (ν). The troops were filled with enthusiasm; they
took up their quarters about two yojanas distant, and bathed
in the {%Sarasvatī%} of red waters on the sacred and beautiful
tableland at the foot of {%Himavat%} (IX, {@5@}); there they passed
the night: {%Śalya%}, etc. (ξ), and urged {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to continue
the battle. {%Duryodhana%} addressed {%Aśvatthāman%} (description)
(ο), according to whose proposal {%Śalya%} was made genera-
lissimo (π) (IX, {@6@}); {%Śalya%} promised to slay the foes (ρ).
{%Śalya%} was anointed; the troops became cheerful (σ). {%Śalya%}
resolved to slay or be slain (τ). No one any longer felt any
grief on account of {%Karṇa%}; they slept that night happily
and became very cheerful. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked {%Kṛṣṇa%} his
advice (υ); {%Kṛṣṇa%} praised {%Śalya (Ārtāyani%}), saying that he
was equal to {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (ϕ), and superior to {%Śikhaṇḍin%},
etc. (χ); he thought only {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} was a match for
{%Śalya%}, and urged him to slay him. After {%Kṛṣṇa%} had gone,
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} dismissed all his brothers and the {%Somakas%} and
slept happily that night, and so did the {%Pāñcālas%} and the
{%Pāṇḍavas%}, delighted with {%Karṇa's%} fall (IX, {@7@}).—§ 611:
THE BATTLE OF THE FORENOON OF THE EIGHTEENTH DAY.
After that night had passed away, the {%Kuru%} army, urged by
{%Duryodhana%}, prepared for battle; the leaders, {%Kṛpa%}, etc. (α),
resolved to fight unitedly (“or be stained with the five great
sins and all the minor sins”). Then, with {%Śalya%} at their
head, they quickly proceeded against the foes. Similarly,
the {%Pāṇḍavas%}. Asked by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} about {%Śalya's%}
slaughter by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and {%Duryodhana's%} by {%Bhīmasena%},
{%Sañjaya%} related: {%Śalya%} proceeded with horses of the {%Sindhu%}
breed yoked unto his chariot, at the head of the array, accom-
panied by the {%Madrakas%} and the sons of {%Karṇa%}; enumeration of
warriors on the left (β), on the right (γ), in the rear (δ), in the
centre (ε); {%Śakuni%} and {%Ulūka%} surrounded by a large force of
cavalry, etc. The mighty bowmen amongst the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
divided themselves into three bodies, and rushed against the
{%Kurus; Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, etc. (ζ), against the army of {%Śalya%};
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} with his troops against {%Śalya%} alone; {%Arjuna%}
against {%Kṛtavarman%} and the {%Saṃśaptakas; Bhīmasena%}, etc. (η),
against {%Kṛpa; Nakula%} and {%Sahadeva%} against {%Śakuni%} and
{%Ulūka%}. Requested by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya%} enumerated the
relative strength of the two armies (θ) (IX, {@8@}). The
commencement of the battle (description); a terrible slaughter
on both sides. {%Arjuna%} and {%Bhīmasena%} stupefied their foes;
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, etc. (ι), & {%Śalya; Nakula%} and {%Sahadeva%}
proceeded with speed; the {%Kurus%} fled away (IX, {@9@}). {%Śalya%}
{%& Yudhiṣṭhira%} (+ the {%Pāṇḍava%} host); {%Nakula & Karṇa's%} son
{%Citrasena%}, whom he slew; {%Nakula & Citrasena's%} brothers
{%Satyasena%} and {%Suṣeṇa; Nakula%} slew {%Satyasena%}, mounted
the chariot of {%Sutasoma%}, and slew {%Suṣeṇa%}. The {%Kurus%}
were rallied by {%Śalya%}; a great slaughter took place on both
sides. {%Sātyaki%}, etc. (κ), roared like lions, etc. The
{%Kurus%} surrounded {%Śalya%}; thither came {%Arjuna%}, having
slaughtered the {%Saṃśaptakas%}, and the {%Pāṇḍavas%} headed by
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} (IX, {@10@}). {%Śalya%} fought with great heroism
against the troops of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}; portents appeared on
[Page191-a+ 63]
earth and in the skies. {%Śalya & Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (λ);
many were slain; the {%Pāṇḍava%} army repaired to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%};
{%Kṛtavarman%}, etc. (μ), & {%Bhīmasena%}, etc.; {%Kṛtavarman &%}
{%Bhīmasena; Kṛpa & Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Śakuni &%} the {%Draupa-%}
{%deyas; Aśvatthāman &%} the twins; {%Duryodhana & Kṛṣṇa%} and
{%Arjuna%}; the {%Bhoja%} chief slew the brown steeds of {%Bhīmasena%};
{%Śalya%} slew the steeds of {%Sahadeva%}, who then slew {%Śalya's%} son;
{%Kṛpa & Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Aśvatthāman &%} the {%Draupadeyas%};
once more the steeds of {%Bhīmasena%} were slain; he crushed
the steeds and chariot of {%Kṛtavarman%}, who fled away; {%Śalya &%}
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (ν); {%Bhīma%} (with his mace, with which he
had challenged {%Kubera%} and slain Gh. on Gandhamādana) &
{%Śalya%} (IX, {@11@}); “save {%Śalya%} or {%Rāma%} (the delighter of the
{%Yadus%}), none else can venture to encounter {%Bhīma%}; save
{%Bhīma%}, none can venture to encounter {%Śalya”; Kṛpa%} taking
up {%Śalya%} on his own chariot, bore him away; {%Bhīma%} had also
been made senseless. The {%Kurus%} (headed by {%Duryodhana%}) &
the {%Pāṇḍavas; Duryodhana & Cekitāna; Kṛpa%}, etc. (ξ), &
{%Yudhiṣṭhira; Duryodhana & Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Aśvatthāman%}
(with 3,000 chariots, despatched by {%Duryodhana%}) & {%Arjuna%};
{%Śalya + Candrasena + Drumasena & Yudhiṣṭhira%} + 25 {%Cedis%},
etc. (ο); {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} was worsted (IX, {@12@}). {%Sātyaki%} and
{%Bhīmasena%}, etc. (ο) ({%+ Yudhiṣṭhira) & Śalya%}; Si., etc., were
delighted; {%Duryodhana%} regarded the {%Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas%}, and
{%Sṛñjayas%} as already slain; the {%Pāṇḍavas & Śalya%}, who agitated
the whole {%Pāṇḍava%} army; D. and G. wondered; the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
with {%Bhīmasena%} at their head and led by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} did not
fly (IX, {@13@}). {%Arjuna & Aśvatthāman%} and the {%Trigartas; Arjuna%}
destroyed 2,000 chariots; {%Aśvatthāman%} & the {%Pāñcāla Suratha%},
whom he slew; {%Aśvatthāman%} and the {%Saṃśaptakas & Arjuna%}
(IX, {@14@}). {%Duryodhana & Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Śikhaṇḍin%} + the
{%Prabhadrakas & Kṛtavarman%} and {%Kṛpa; Śalya &%} the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
(with {%Bhīma%}, etc. (π), and {%Sātyaki%}); {%Nakula + Yudhiṣṭhira%}
{%& Śalya; Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (ρ), {%& Śalya; Śalya & Bhīmasena%}
{%+ Sātyaki%} (whom he deprived of his chariot); {%Sātyaki%} (on
another chariot) & {%Śalya%} (IX, {@15@}). The {%Pāṇḍavas%} (in the
very sight of {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%}, and though checked by
{%Bhīmasena%}) were afflicted by the {%Kurus%} (headed by {%Śalya%}).
{%Arjuna & Kṛpa%} and {%Kṛtavarman; Sahadeva & Śakuni; Nakula%}
cast glances on {%Śalya%} from the side; the {%Draupadeyas%} checked
numerous kings; {%Śikhaṇḍin & Aśvatthāman; Bhīmasena &%}
{%Duryodhana; Yudhiṣṭhira & Śalya; Śalya%} alone fought with
the whole {%Pāṇḍava%} army; {%Śalya & Bhīma%}; the {%Pāṇḍavas%} fled,
disregarding the cries of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, who, summoning all
his brothers and {%Kṛṣṇa%}, declared that after {%Bhīṣma%},
etc. (σ), had been slain, {%Śalya%} only remained as his
share; the sons of {%Mādrī%} should be the protectors of
his wheels; {%Sātyaki%} would protect his right wheel and
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} his left, {%Arjuna%} his rear, {%Bhīma%} fight
in his front. The {%Pāṇḍava%} troops rejoiced, especially
the {%Pāñcālas%}, etc. (τ); {%Yudhiṣṭhira & Śalya; Bhīma &%}
{%Duryodhana; Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, etc. (υ), & {%Śakuni%}, etc.;
{%Duryodhana%} was borne away by his steeds; {%Aśvatthāman%},
etc. (ϕ), followed him in order to rescue him; the {%Kaurava%}
troops became terrified; {%Arjuna%} began to slay them; {%Śalya%}
was worsted by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}; the army of {%Duryodhana%}
broke; {%Aśvatthāman%}, taking {%Śalya%} up on his own chariot,
fled away; {%Śalya%} (on another chariot) & {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (IX,
{@16@}) + {%Sātyaki%}, etc. (χ); the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, etc. (ψ), & {%Śalya%}; the
{%Kurus%} surrounded {%Śalya%} at the command of {%Duryodhana%};
{%Kṛpa%} slew {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} charioteer, and {%Śalya%} his steeds;
{%Bhīmasena%} slew {%Śalya's%} charioteer and steeds and cut off his
armour; {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, etc. (ω), & {%Śalya; Yudhiṣṭhira%}
[Page191-b+ 63]
slew {%Śalya%} with a celestial dart (created by {%Tvaṣṭṛ%} for the
use of {%Īśāna%}, and always worshipped by the {%Pāṇḍavas%} with
perfumes and garlands and excellent seats and the best
kinds of viands and drinks). {%Śalya's%} younger brother &
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, who slew him; the {%Kurus%} broke; {%Sātyaki%}
{%& Kṛtavarman%}, whom {%Kṛpa%} carried away on his chariot;
{%Duryodhana%} alone withstood the {%Pāṇḍava%} leaders (αα);
{%Kṛtavarman%} (on another chariot) + {%Kṛpa & Yudhiṣṭhira%};
{%Kṛtavarman%} was carried away by {%Aśvatthāman%} upon the
latter's chariot; {%Kṛpa & Yudhiṣṭhira%}. The {%Pārthas%} blew
their conchs and applauded {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (IX, {@17@}). The
followers of {%Śalya%} (1,700 {%Madrakas%}) resolved to avenge him;
{%Duryodhana%} commanded them not to proceed to battle; they,
however, attacked {%Yudhiṣṭhira; Arjuna%}, etc. (ββ), & the
{%Madrakas%}, whom they began to slaughter; {%Duryodhana%} in
vain tried to prevent them from fighting; then, urged by
{%Śakuni%}, he proceeded to the rescue of the {%Madrakas%}. The
{%Pāṇḍavas%} arranged themselves in the form called {%Madhyama%}
and slew the {%Madrakas%}; meteors, etc., were seen; the {%Pārthas%}
encountered a body of horse advancing towards them; the
{%Kuru%} army fled away (IX, {@18@}). Also the sons of {%Dhṛta-%}
{%rāṣṭra%} almost all turned away from the fight at noon;
their fear was like to that after the fall of {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (γγ);
the {%Pāñcālas%} and the {%Pāṇḍavas%} pursued them, and congratulated
one another (δδ). The {%Sṛñjayas%} pursued the {%Kurus; Arjuna%}
& the chariot-division; {%Nakula%}, etc. (εε), & {%Śakuni. Duryodhana%}
rallied 21,000 foot-soldiers, resisted by {%Bhīmasena%} and {%Dhṛṣ-%}
{%ṭadyumna; Bhīma%} slew them; {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} troops in vain
tried to transgress {%Duryodhana. Duryodhana%} rallied a small
force by a spirited address (ζζ); the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, especially
{%Arjuna%}, rushed against them; {%Nakula%}, etc. (ηη), against {%Śakuni%}
(IX, {@19@}). The {%Mleccha%} king {%Śālva%} (on an elephant, sprung
from a noble breed, and always worshipped by {%Duryodhana%})
attacked the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (+ {%Somakas%} and {%Sṛñjayas%}), who fled;
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} (in order to vanquish the elephant) & {%Śālva%};
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} had his chariot, steeds, and charioteer destroyed
by the elephant; {%Bhīma%}, etc. (θθ), & {%Śālva%} (+ the elephant);
the {%Pāñcālas%}, etc. (ιι), lamented; {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} slew the
elephant with his mace, and {%Sātyaki%} slew {%Śālva%} (IX, {@20@}).
{%Kṛtavarman%}, rallying a portion of the {%Kuru%} army, resisted
the {%Pāṇḍavas; Sātyaki%} & king {%Kṣemakīrti%}, whom he slew;
{%Kṛtavarman & Sātyaki%}; the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, the {%Pāñcālas%}, etc.,
became spectators; {%Kṛpa%} carried {%Kṛtavarman%} away upon his
chariot; the whole army of {%Duryodhana%} fled except {%Duryodhana%},
who assailed all the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, etc. (κκ); then {%Kṛtavarman%} came
(on another chariot) (IX, {@21@}). {%Duryodhana%} alone resisted
the {%Pāṇḍavas%}; the {%Kuru%} army once more rallied and fought;
{%Duryodhana & Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (λλ); {%Aśvatthāman & Bhīma-%}
{%sena; Śakuni & Yudhiṣṭhira%}, who was carried away by
{%Sahadeva%} on his chariot; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (on another chariot) &
{%Śakuni%}; Si. and Cā. applauded; {%Ulūka & Nakula; Kṛta-%}
{%varman & Sātyaki; Duryodhana & Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Kṛpa &%}
the {%Draupadeyas%} (IX, {@22@}). The {%Kurus%} were broken by the
{%Pāṇḍavas%}, but rallied by the sons of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra; Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira & Kṛpa%} and {%Kṛtavarman%} (who was carried away by
{%Aśvatthāman%}); {%Duryodhana%} despatched 700 chariots against
{%Yudhiṣṭhira; Śikhaṇḍin%}, etc., came to aid {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}; an
awful battle ensued; the 700 were slain; the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and
{%Pāñcālas%} resisted; terrifying omens in nature were seen.
{%Śakuni%} exhorted the others to fight in front; he would
himself slay the {%Pāṇḍavas%} from behind; the {%Madrakas%}
rejoiced, but were slain; {%Śakuni%} with 10,000 horsemen
assailed the {%Pāṇḍava%} army in the rear; the force of the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
[Page192-a+ 63]
broke down. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} urged {%Sahadeva%} to slay {%Śakuni%},
aided by the {%Draupadeyas; Yudhiṣṭhira%}, with the {%Pāñcālas%},
would himself destroy the chariot-force. {%Sahadeva%} (with 700
elephants, 5,000 horses, and 3,000 foot-soldiers) + the
{%Draupadeyas & Śakuni%}, who, with 6,000 horses, went away;
similarly, the {%Pāṇḍava%} force, which was reduced to 6,000
horses; the {%Draupadeyas%} proceeded to {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Sahadeva%}
to {%Yudhiṣṭhira; Śakuni & Dhṛṣṭadyumna's%} division; after
a terrible battle the {%Pāṇḍavas%} encompassed {%Śakuni%} (IX, {@23@}).
{%Śakuni%} exhorted the remainder of his following, 700 horses,
and urged {%Duryodhana%} to attack the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (μμ); the
remnant of the {%Kuru%} army attacked the {%Pāṇḍavas; Arjuna%}
(desiring to exterminate the {%Kurus%}) addressed {%Kṛṣṇa%},
recounting the loss sustained by the {%Kurus%} (νν), and
attacked the remnant of the {%Kuru%} army, and caused a great
slaughter (IX, {@24@}). {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, etc. (ξξ), & the
chariot-force; {%Duryodhana%} escaped on horseback to {%Śakuni%};
3,000 elephants encompassed the {%Pāṇḍava%} brothers, and
were slain by {%Arjuna%} and {%Bhīma%}, etc. (οο). {%Aśvatthāman%},
etc. (ππ), enquired about {%Duryodhana%}, pierced through
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna's%} force, and proceeded to {%Śakuni%}. The
{%Pāṇḍavas%}, headed by {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, assailed the {%Kurus%}.
{%Sañjaya%} (having joined the five leaders and posted his men,
who had been afflicted by {%Arjuna%}, by {%Kṛpa%}) {%& Dhṛṣṭadyumna%};
{%Sātyaki & Sañjaya%}, who was made captive; {%Bhīma%} and {%Arjuna%}
destroyed the elephants; {%Aśvatthāman%}, etc., seeking {%Duryo-%}
{%dhana%}, proceeded to {%Śakuni%} (IX, {@25@}). Eleven sons of
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra: Durmarṣaṇa%}, etc. (ρρ), {%& Bhīmasena%}, who
slew them. {%Bhīmasena%} then slew 500 chariot-warriors, 10,000
foot, 700 elephants, and 800 horses (IX, {@26@}). {%Duryodhana%}
and {%Sudarśa%} (the only sons of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} yet unslain) were
in the midst of the cavalry. {%Kṛṣṇa%} urged {%Arjuna%} to destroy
the remnant of {%Duryodhana's%} troops (σσ); {%Arjuna%} assented (ττ);
“only 500 horses form the remnant of the troops of {%Śakuni%}
{%…%}; there remain also {%Aśvatthāman%}, etc. (υυ).”
{%Bhīmasena%}, etc. (ϕϕ), & {%Duryodhana + Śakuni; Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%}
son {%Sudarśana & Bhīmasena; Suśarman%} and {%Śakuni & Arjuna%};
{%Duryodhana%} (on horseback) & {%Sahadeva. Arjuna%} & the
{%Trigartas; Arjuna%} slew {%Satyakarman, Satyeṣu%}, and the
{%Prasthala%} ruler {%Suśarman%}, and the latter's thirty-five sons,
etc., and then proceeded against the remnant of the {%Bharata%}
host. {%Bhīma%} slew {%Sudarśana%} (Dhārtarāṣṭra), and completed
the destruction of the {%Kaurava%} army (IX, {@27@}). {%Śakuni &%}
{%Sahadeva; Ulūka & Bhīmasena; Sahadeva%} sat down on his

who slew him (IX, {@28@}).
