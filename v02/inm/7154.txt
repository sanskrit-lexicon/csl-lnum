{@Mārjāra-mūṣika-saṃvāda(ḥ)@}¦ (“the discourse
between a cat and a mouse”). § 646{%b%} (Āpaddh.): There
was a large banyan in the midst of a forest, with various
kinds of birds, etc. A wise mouse, {%Palita%}, lived at the foot
of that tree, having made a hole there with 100 outlets.
On the branches lived a cat {%Lomaśa%}. A {%Cāṇḍāla%} came and
built a hut, setting his traps of leather strings every evening
after sunset. One day he caught the cat. {%Palita%} began to
eat the flesh in the trap, but beheld the mongoose {%Harito%}
and the owl {%Candraka%}. He resolved upon saving the cat
though an enemy, in order to escape from them; having
made peace with the cat, he crouched beneath it; the
mongoose and owl left the spot; the mouse began to cut
the strings slowly, notwithstanding the cat's impatience.
At morning the {%Cāṇḍāla Parigha%} appeared (description),
accompanied by a pack of dogs. Then the mouse quickly cut
the remaining string; the cat got upon the banyan, {%Palita%}
entered his hole. The hunter took up his net and left the
spot. {%Palita%} would not conclude friendship with the cat,
and entered another hole.
