{@Kāśyapa@},¦ a ṛṣi and prajāpati, son of Marīci. § 27 (cf.
Āstīkap.): Sauti related: Kadrū and Vinatā, the daughters
of Prajāpati, obtained from their husband {%K%}. the boon that
Kadrū would have 1,000 snakes as her offspring, and Vinatā
two sons, who would surpass the 1,000 sons of Kadrū. Then
{%K%}. went to the forest. After a long time Kadrū brought
forth 1,000 eggs and Vinatā two. After 500 years the 1,000
eggs of Kadrū burst, but the twins of Vinatā did not yet
appear. Vinatā then broke one of the eggs, and out came
Aruṇa (who afterwards became the charioteer of the Sun
({%Sūrya%})). His lower extremities were yet undeveloped, and
he cursed his mother, saying that she should serve as a slave,
but be delivered by her other son, if she would wait 500 years
[Page367-b+ 63]
patiently without breaking the egg. After the expiration of
the 500 years Garuḍa came out of the egg (I, {@16@}): I, {@16@},
