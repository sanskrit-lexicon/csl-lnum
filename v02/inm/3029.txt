[{@Dakṣa-yajña-vināśa(ḥ)@}]¦ (“the destruction of
Dakṣa's sacrifice”). § 695{%b%} (Mokṣadh.): Vaiśampāyana(!)
said: In days of yore {%Dakṣa%} made arrangements for
performing a sacrifice on the top of {%Himavat%} in that sacred
region inhabited by Ṛ. and Si., G. and Aps., where the
{%Gaṅgā%} issues out of the mountains. The gods, etc. (α), came
there. Ṛ. {%Dadhīca%} in wrath and grief said that this was no
sacrifice, since {%Rudra%} (Śiva) was not adored in it, etc.; he,
the great {%yogin%}, saw into the future; he beheld {%Śiva%} seated
with {%Nārada%} and {%Umā. Dakṣa%} said he knew the eleven
{%Rudras%} with lances and matted locks, but he did not know
who this {%Maheśvara%} was. {%Dakṣa%} said that he would
perform the sacrifice unto Viṣṇu. Umā felt grief. {%Śiva%}
said that it is to him as the Lord of Sacrifices that the chanters
utter their praises in sacrifices, etc. (β). Then he created
from his mouth a terrible being (description), and {%Umā%}
herself, assuming the terrible form of {%Mahākālī%}, proceeded in
the company of that being, that was the living embodiment
of {%Śiva's%} wrath and resembled {%Śiva%} himself, and came to be
called {%Vīrabhadra%}. He then created from the pores of his
body a large number of spirit-chiefs named {%Raumyas%}. These
{%Rudras%} attacked the sacrifice (description; Ṛ., D., and men
looked pale) and began to set fire to everything, and tore off
the head of the sacrifice. D. and {%Brahmán%} and {%Dakṣa%},
informed by {%Vīrabhadra%}, hymned {%Śiva%} (γ), who, asked
by {%Dakṣa%}, granted to him the boon that his sacrificial
articles should be of use to him. Then Dakṣa knelt
down and uttered his 1008 names (v. <is>Dakṣa-prokta-</is>
<is>Śiva-sahasranāmastotra</is>).
