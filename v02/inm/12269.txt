{@Vṛddhakanyā@}¦ (“old virgin”). § 615 (Baladevatīrtha-
yātrā): IX, {@51@}, †2978.—§ 615{%u%} (do.): The ṛṣi {%Kuṇi-Garga%}
by penances created a fair daughter from his mind and then
went to heaven. She worshipped the {%Pitṛs%} and the gods
with fasts and practised penances in that solitary forest not
wishing to marry, as she did not see a husband worthy of
her. When she could no longer move, she set her heart
upon departing for the other world. {%Nārada%} told her that
she had no regions of blessedness to obtain, not having
cleansed herself by the rite of marriage. She then went to
a concourse of {%ṛṣis%}, and said that she would give half her
penances to him who would accept her hand in marriage.
{%Gālava's%} son, the ṛṣi {%Prākśṛṅgavat%}, accepted her hand on
condition that he should live with her only one night. On
that night she became a young lady of the finest complexion,
etc., and {%Gālava's%} son became very happy. At morn she
said: “he that will, with rapt attention, pass one night in
this tīrtha after having gratified the gods with oblations of
water, shall obtain the merit of the vow of {%brahmacarya%} for
58 years,” and then she departed for heaven. He soon
followed her, moved by sorrow: IX, {@52@}, 3003.
