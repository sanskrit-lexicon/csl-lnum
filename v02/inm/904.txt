{@Astradarśana@}¦ (“the show of arms”). § 208 (Sambhav.):
I, {@134@}: When the princes had become accomplished in arms
{%Droṇa%} addressed {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} in the presence of {%Kṛpa%},
{%Somadatta, Bāhlīka, Bhīṣma, Vyāsa%}, and {%Vidura%}, asking
him to let them show their proficiency. {%Vidura%} then let
{%Droṇa%} measure out a place, and {%Kuntī, Gāndhārī%}, etc. (“like
celestial ladies ascending {%Meru%}”), and the citizens came out
to behold the princes' skill. {%Droṇa%} and {%Aśvatthāman%}
appeared like the Moon ({%Aṃśumat%}) accompanied by the
planet Mars ({%Aṅgāraka%}). The spectators, seeing the prowess
of the princes, fancied they were beholding the city of the
{%Gandharvas. Vidura%} described all the feats of the princes
to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, and {%Kuntī%} to {%Gāndhārī%} (I, {@134@}). A combat
with maces between {%Duryodhana%} and {%Bhīma%} divided the
spectators into two parties, until {%Droṇa%} caused {%Aśvatthāman%}
to separate them. The exploits of {%Arjuna (b%}) were quite
wonderful. {%Droṇa%} stood surrounded by the five {%Pārthas%}
like the Moon in conjunction with the five-starred {%Sāvitra%}
(i.e. {%Hasta%}), and {%Duryodhana%}, mace in hand, surrounded by his
100 brothers and {%Aśvatthāman%}, was like {%Purandara%} (i.e. {%Indra%})
encircled by the hosts of gods on the occasion of the victory
over the {%Dānavas%} (I, {@135@}). {%Karṇa (c%}) enters and challenges
{%Arjuna%}. The {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%} stood by {%Karṇa%}, while {%Droṇa%},
{%Kṛpa%}, and {%Bhīṣma%} remained with {%Arjuna. Kuntī%} swooned
away, and was restored to consciousness by {%Vidura%}, who
caused sandal paste and water to be sprinkled on her person.
{%Kṛpa%} rejects {%Karṇa%}; but {%Duryodhana%} then installed {%Karṇa%}
as king of {%Aṅga%} (I, {@136@}). The sun went down; {%Duryodhana%}
led {%Karṇa%} out of the arena, and the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, accompanied
by {%Droṇa, Kṛpa%}, and {%Bhīṣma%}, returned to their abodes
(I, {@137@}).
