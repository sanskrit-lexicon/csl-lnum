[{@Ānuśāsanikaparvan@}]¦ (“the section relating to in-
struction,” the 91st of the minor parvans of Mahābhārata;
cf. Anuśāsanika). § 719: {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} despondency at the
slaughter of his kinsmen on the field of {%Kurukṣetra%}; he
enquired how he might be cleansed of his sins; {%Bhīṣma%}
comforted him by telling him that the soul is not the cause
of our acts, citing the ancient story <is>Gautamī-lubdhaka-</is>
<is>vyāla-Mṛtyu-kāla-saṃvāda</is> ({%b%}), “This evil has neither
been of thy own creation, nor of {%Duryodhana's%}, but of
{%Kāla's%}.” {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} became consoled (XIII, {@1@}).—§ 720:
[Page043-a+ 63]
Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} if any householder had ever succeeded
in conquering {%Mṛtyu%} by virtue, {%Bhīṣma%} recited the ancient
story <is>Sudarśanopākhyāna</is> ({%b%}), “To a householder there
is no higher divinity than the guest; the blessings of an
honoured guest are more efficacious than the merit of
100 sacrifices. Whenever a deserving guest seeks the
hospitality of an householder and is not honoured by him,
he takes away [with him] all the virtues of the latter,
giving him his sins [in return].” Blessing upon the reader
(XIII, {@2@}).—§ 721: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked how the {%Kṣattriya%}
{%Viśvāmitra%} became a brahman, mentioning his destroying of
the 100 sons of {%Vasiṣṭha%}, etc. (α), and comparing the
instance of {%Mataṅga%}, who was born as a {%Caṇḍāla%} and could
not attain to brahmanhood (XIII, {@3@}). {%Bhīṣma%} related how in
olden times {%Viśvāmitra%} attained to the position of a {%brahman%}
and B.-ṛ, i.e. <is>Viśvāmitropākhyāna</is> ({%b%}), (XIII, {@4@}).—§ 722:
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} wished to know the merits of compassion and
the characteristics of devout men. {%Bhīṣma%} recited the
ancient story of the discourse between {%Indra%} and the parrot
(in the territories of the {%Kāśi%} king) who did not desert the
blasted tree wherein it had been born, though the tree had
withered, being pierced by a fowler with a poisoned arrow.
The parrot, by his penances, knew {%Indra%} (who came in the
shape of a brahman), and, being granted a boon, made {%Indra%}
revive the tree; and after death he came to the region of
{%Indra%} (XIII, {@5@}).—§ 723: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} enquired which of
the two, Exertion and Destiny, is more powerful. {%Bhīṣma%}
related the ancient story of the conversation of {%Vasiṣṭha%}
and {%Brahmán%}, in which {%Brahmán%} showed the necessity of
exertion, notwithstanding the force of destiny, under reference
to the example of the gods, etc. (α); {%Janamejaya%}, who followed
in the footsteps of {%Indra%}, was checked and put down by the
gods on account of his having killed a brahman woman; the
{%viprarṣi Vaiśampāyana%} was put down by the gods for killing
a brahman by ignorance and a child (XIII, {@6@}).—§ 724:
Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} related the various fruits
of various good acts. The {%Kuru%} princes became filled with
wonder at his doctrine, as narrated by Ṛ. of old (XIII, {@7@}).
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} enquired who should be honoured and who
liked, etc.; {%Bhīṣma's%} answer about the duty of honouring
good brahmans (XIII, {@8@}).—§ 725: {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} enquiry
about the misery that awaits those who refuse to make gifts
to brahmans after having promised to give them. {%Bhīṣma%}
set forth the various kinds of misery that await such men,
citing the old narrative of the discourse between a jackal and
an ape: While both were human beings they were intimate
friends; after death one of them became a jackal and the
other an ape, the former because he had not given to a
brahman what he had promised to give, the latter because he
used to appropriate the fruits belonging to brahmans. {%Bhīṣma%}
had heard this from his preceptor and from {%Kṛṣṇa%} (XIII, {@9@}).
—§ 726: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} wished to know whether any fault is
incurred by one who gives instruction to a person belonging
to a low caste. {%Bhīṣma%} recited what he had heard certain
Ṛ. say in days of yore: instruction should not be imparted
to one that belongs to a low or mean caste. He related
the following instance that occurred in days of old: There
was a sacred hermitage on the {%Himavat%}, inhabited by
Si., Cā., {%Vālakhilyas%}, etc. (description). A {%Śūdra%} asked the
head of the college ({%kulapati%}) to initiate him into a life of
renunciation, but he was refused. He then, at some distance,
made a hut, etc., for himself, and began to live according to
rigid vows, made sacrifices to the gods, etc. (description).
[Page043-b+ 63]
A Ṛ. used to come to him, and, at his request, promised to
assist him in {%Pitṛ-yajña%}. As the {%Śūdra%} placed the [stool
called] {%bṛsī%} towards the south with its head turned towards
the west, Ṛ. told him to place the {%bṛsī%} with its head turned
towards the east, and to sit with his face turned towards the
north, and gave him all directions about the {%śrāddha%} as laid
down in the ordinances, and after the rites had been accom-
plished Ṛ. returned to his own abode. After a long time
the {%Śūdra%} ascetic met with his death in those woods, and in
his next life took birth in the family of a great king; the
Ṛ. in his next life took birth in the family of a priest, and
became well versed in the {%Atharvaveda%}, etc. (α); the re-
born {%Śūdra%} was installed king after his father's death. He
appointed the reborn Ṛ. as his priest, and ruled his kingdom
righteously; but every day, when he saw his priest, he
smiled or laughed. The priest made him swear to tell him
the truth, and he was then informed by him about their former
births, where the penances of Ṛ. had all been frustrated by
the instruction he had given to the {%Śūdra%}. In order that he
might not obtain a still lower birth in his next life, he
caused him to relinquish his present office as priest, make
gifts, and observe vows, repairing to many sacred places,
and at last, his soul having become purified, living in that
very asylum where he had lived in his former birth,
practising very severe penances; thus he succeeded in
attaining to the highest success (XIII, {@10@}).—§ 727:
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} enquired after the nature of the man or the
woman in whom the goddess of Prosperity always dwells.
{%Bhīṣma%} related the conversation between {%Rukmiṇī%} (the
mother of {%Pradyumna%} with the {%Makara%} banner) and the
goddess {%Śrī%}, whom she once asked this question in the
presence of {%Devakī's%} son (XIII, {@11@}).—§ 728: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
enquired which of the two, man or woman, derives the
greater pleasure from sexual union. {%Bhīṣma%} told the old
story of the discourse between {%Bhaṅgāsvana%} and {%Śakra%},
i.e. <is>Bhaṅgāsvanopākhyāna</is> ({%b%}), (XIII, {@12@}).—§ 729:
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked how one should act in order to live happily
both here and hereafter; {%Bhīṣma's%} answer indicating the
chief duties of commission and omission (XIII, {@13@}).—§ 730:
Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} discoursed about the
different names of {%Mahādeva%} and his puissance, but soon
caused {%Kṛṣṇa%} to take up the topic before the conclave of
Ṛ. with {%Vyāsa%}, just as Ṛ. {%Taṇḍin%}, the offspring of {%Brahmán%},
had in days of yore told the 1,000 names of {%Mahādeva%}
before {%Brahmán%} in {%Brahmaloka%}. “After twelve years
had expired from the time when {%Pradyumna%} (the son of
{%Rukmiṇī%}) slew the {%Asura Śambara%} in days of yore, my
spouse {%Jāmbavatī%} (seeing the sons of {%Rukmiṇī—Pradyumna%},
{%Cārudeṣṇa%}, etc.) asked me to grant her a heroic son, saying:
‘By worshipping {%Mahādeva%} for twelve years and emaciating
thyself in observing vows, thou hast begotten the sons {%Cāru-%}
{%deṣṇa%}, etc., with {%Rukmiṇī%} (α).’ She prayed that {%Brahmán%},
etc. (β), would protect me; I took leave of {%Āhuka%}, etc. (γ),
and {%Garuḍa%} bore me to {%Himavat%}, where I dismissed him;
I there saw the asylum (description) of {%Upamanyu Vaiyāghra-%}
{%padya%}, reverenced by D., G., and K., adorned with {%Gaṅgā%},
etc. {%Upamanyu%} directed me to devote myself to penances
and gratify {%Śiva%}, here where D. and Ṛ. had in days of yore
gratified him, who took his birth as Dā. {%Hiraṇyakaśipu (b%}),
who was the father of {%Mandāra%} ({%c%}), irresistible even to {%Viṣṇu's%}
discus {%Sudarśana (d); Śiva%} had further granted boons to the
{%Dānavas%} (or {%Asuras%}) {%Vidyutprabha (e), Śatamukha (f%}), and
to {%Brahmán%}, etc. (δ); the sacrifice {%Saptakapāla%}, etc. (ζ).
[Page044-a+ 63]
Having narrated his former relations to {%Mahādeva, Upamanyu%}
({%g%}) there pointed out to me Si., Ṛ., V.-D., Y., G., Aps.,
etc., and said that in the sixth month from that time
I should behold {%Mahādeva%} and obtain twenty-four boons
from him and {%Umā%}. He gave me certain {%mantras%}, by reciting
which I was sure to behold {%Śaṅkara%}. On the eighth day
I underwent the {%dīkṣā%}, etc. (description); for one month
I lived on fruits, etc.; then I beheld {%Mahādeva%} (description)
and {%Umā%} in a cloud (description), surrounded by 1,100
{%Rudras%}, etc., praised by Ā., V., V.-D., A., {%Indra%}, etc. (ω),
uttered the {%Rathantara Sāman%} in the presence of {%Bhava%}
(Śiva). Innumerable masters of {%Yoga%}, etc. (αα), were
bowing down to him; {%Sanatkumāra%}, etc. (ββ), were beheld
by me standing there in their bodily forms; Lp., etc.
(γγ), were seen to bow down to {%Śiva%}; G. and Aps. sang
and hymned him; V.-D., etc. (δδ), were adoring him in
thought, word, and deed; {%Brahmán, Śakra%}, etc., looked at
me; I, however, had not the power to look at {%Mahādeva%}.
I saluted {%Mahādeva%}: ‘Thou art,’ etc. (εε). {%Śiva%} roared like
a lion; the innumerable brahmans there present, etc. (ζζ),
bowed down to {%Śiva. Śiva%}, looking at {%Umā, Indra%}, and
myself, told me to ask for eight boons” (XIII, {@14@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%}
went on to enumerate the eight boons, including hundreds
upon hundreds of children and (granted by {%Umā%} in the name
of {%Śiva%}) a son {%Śāmba%}. “{%Umā%} also granted me eight boons”
(including 100 sons), “and said that I should have 16,000
wives, etc.; and that 7,000 guests would daily feed at my
palace. Then {%Śiva%} and {%Umā%} disappeared with their {%gaṇas%}.
All this I related to {%Upamanyu%}” (XIII, {@15@}). {%Upamanyu%}
said: There was in the {%Kṛta%} age a Ṛ. {%Taṇḍi%} who devoutly
adored the god [Śiva] for 10,000 years. He succeeded
in beholding {%Mahādeva%} and praised him (ηη), and further
said: Neither {%Brahmán%}, etc. (θθ), know thee. {%Śiva%} said
that {%Taṇḍi%} should be imperishable and eternal, etc., and
his son become the author of {%Sūtras%}, etc., and granted him
a boon. {%Taṇḍi%} said: Let my devotion to thee be steady.
Then the god disappeared. Then {%Taṇḍi%} came to my (i.e.
Upamanyu's) asylum and told me all that had happened to
him. Dost thou hear all those celebrated names [of Mahā-
deva] that {%Taṇḍi%} said unto me. {%Brahmán%} had at one time
enumerated 10,000 names of {%Mahādeva%}; in the scriptures
1,000 names of him occur. They are not known to all, but
were uttered in days of yore by {%Brahmán%} for the purpose
of adoring {%Śiva%}. Having acquired them by the favour of
{%Brahmán, Taṇḍi%} communicated them to me (XIII, {@16@}).
{%Kṛṣṇa%} said: “B.-ṛ. {%Upamanyu%} said: I shall adore [Śiva]
with names uttered by {%Brahmán%}; Ṛ., in the {%Vedas%} and
{%Vedāṅgas%}, applied by {%Taṇḍi%}, etc. [i.e. <is>Mahādeva-sahasra-</is>
<is>nāma-stotra</is>].” Blessing upon the reader; “Dā., Y.,
Rā., Pś., {%Yātudhānas%}, and Gh. can do no injury to him”
(XIII, {@17@}). {%Vyāsa%} told {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to gratify {%Śiva%} with
this hymn consisting of 1,008 names; {%Vyāsa%} had himself
recited it in former days, when engaged in penances on {%Meru%}
in order to obtain a son, and he had obtained the fulfilment
of all his wishes. After this {%Kapila%}, etc. (ιι), obtained
boons from {%Śiva%}. Then {%[Rāma] Jāmadagnya%}, etc. (κκ),
narrated to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} the boons they had been granted by
{%Śiva. Vaiśampāyana%} continued: Hearing these marvellous
feats of {%Mahādeva%} related by the ascetics, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
became amazed. Then {%Kṛṣṇa%} said to {%Yudhiṣṭhira: Upa-%}
{%manyu%} said to me: Unrighteous men, stained by {%Rajas%}
and {%Tamas%}, do not succeed in attaining to {%Īśāna%} (Śiva);
even if a person lives in the enjoyment of every pleasure
[Page044-b+ 63]
and luxury, yet he comes to be regarded as the equal of
pure-minded forest recluses if he is devoted to the Supreme
Deity; if {%Rudra%} is pleased with a person, he can confer
upon him the position of either {%Brahmán%} or {%Keśava%} or
{%Śakra%} with all the deities under him, or the sovereignty
of the three worlds; a person who devastates the whole
universe does not become stained with sin if he adores and
worships {%Śiva…%} Then {%Kṛṣṇa%} said to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}:
{%Āditya%}, etc. (λλ), have sprung from that creator of all
creatures (Śiva); indeed, that subtle {%Brahmán%} is the cause
of life. Blessing upon the reader (XIII, {@18@}). [§ 730,
i.e. XIII, {@14—18@}, is called {%Meghavāhanopākhyāna%}.]—§ 731:
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} enquired after the purport of the scriptural
injunction to husband and wife about the joint performance
of all duties. {%Bhīṣma%} related the old narrative of the
discourse between {%Aṣṭāvakra%} and {%Diśā%}, i.e. <is>Aṣṭāvakra-</is>
<is>Dik-saṃvāda</is> ({%b%}), (XIII, {@19—21@}).—§ 732: Asked by
{%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} discoursed on the question who is
worthy of receiving gifts, etc., quoting Ṛ. {%Mārkaṇḍeya%}, etc.
(α), (XIII, {@22@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} discussed
the ordinances regulating the actions to be perpetrated towards
the deities and the {%Pitṛs%} on the occasions of {%śrāddhas%}: “One
should carefully perform all acts relating to the deities in the
forenoon, and all acts relating to the {%Pitṛs%} in the afternoon;
that gift that is made untimely, etc., is appropriated by
Rā.”; the brahmans that must not be invited to {%śrāddhas%},
and those that should be invited, etc.; {%Jātakarman%}, etc.
(XIII, {@23@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} discussed
the circumstances under which a person may become guilty
of brahmanicide without actually slaying a brahman (XIII,
{@24@}).—§ 733: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} about the holy places
on earth, {%Bhīṣma%} repeated the enumeration of them ({%a%})
made by {%Aṅgiras%} to {%Gautama%}, who put this same question,
especially mentioning the result of bathing in {%Candrabhāgā%},
etc. ({%b%}), in {%Puṣkara%}, etc. ({%c%}), in {%Hiraṇyabindu%}, etc. ({%d%}),
in {%Indratoyā%}, etc. ({%e%}), in {%Gaṅgādvāra%}, etc. ({%f%}), at {%Sapta-%}
{%gaṅga%}, etc. ({%g%}), at {%Kanyākūpa%}, etc. ({%h%}), in {%Devikā%}, etc. ({%i%}),
{%Mahāgaṅgā%}, etc. ({%j), Vaimānika%}, etc. ({%k%}), in {%Śarastamba%}, etc. ({%l%}),
{%Citrakūṭa%}, etc. ({%m), Mataṅgavāpī%}, etc. ({%n), Gaṅgāhrada%},
etc. ({%o), Gaṅgā-Yamunayos tīrthaṃ%}, etc. ({%p), Marudgaṇa%},
etc. ({%q), Utpātaka%}, etc. ({%r), Aśmapṛṣṭha%}, etc. ({%s), Viśālā%},
etc. ({%t), Punarāvartanandā%}, etc. ({%u), Rāmahrada%}, etc. ({%v%}),
{%Narmadā%}, etc. ({%w), Cāṇḍālikāśrama%} (B. {%Āñjali°%}), etc. ({%x%}),
{%Ujjānaka%}, etc. ({%y), Kālodaka%}, etc. ({%z%}). For the purpose
of repairing to all the {%tīrthas%} in the world, one should
mentally think of those amongst them that are wholly or
almost inaccessible. {%Aṅgiras%} had obtained this discourse
from {%Kaśyapa%}. Blessing upon the reader (XIII, {@25@}).—
§ 734: {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: Though equal unto {%Bṛhaspati%}
in intelligence, {%Brahmán%} in forgiveness, {%Indra%} in progress,
and {%Sūrya%} in energy, {%Bhīṣma%} (the son of {%Gaṅgā%}) had
been overthrown in battle by {%Arjuna%}. Accompanied by his
brothers, etc., {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked him these questions. He
was lying on a bed of arrows in expectation of the time of
death. Many M.-ṛ. had come there to see him: {%Atri%}, etc. (α).
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} with his brothers duly worshipped those Ṛ.,
who then sat down and conversed about {%Bhīṣma%} (who
became delighted), and then, taking leave of {%Bhīṣma%} and
the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, made themselves invisible. The {%Pāṇḍavas%}
then waited upon {%Bhīṣma%}, and seeing the quarters of the
sky blazing forth with splendour on account of the penances
of the {%Ṛṣis%}, they became filled with wonder, and talked it
over with {%Bhīṣma. Vaiśampāyana%} continued: After that
[Page045-a+ 63]
conversation was over, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} touched {%Bhīṣma's%} feet
with his head, and then resumed his questions relating to
morality and righteousness. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked which
countries, retreats, mountains, and rivers are foremost in
point of sanctity. {%Bhīṣma%} related the old narrative of
a conversation between a brahman who was a {%śiloñcha-vṛtti%}
(subsisting upon gleanings) (or {%śilavṛtti%}) householder and
a {%siddha%} (crowned with ascetic success) Ṛ., who roamed
over the earth and once had passed the night in the house
of the {%śilavṛtti%}, who, when they had conversed on subjects
connected with the {%Vedas%} and {%Upaniṣads%}, asked him this
very question, and was instructed by him about the superior
sanctity of {%Gaṅgā%}. Then the {%siddha%} ascended the firmament,
and the {%śilavṛtti%} sought the protection of {%Gaṅgā%} and attained
to great success. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc., were filled with
delight. Blessing upon the reader (XIII, {@26@}).—§ 735:
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked how a {%Kṣattriya, Vaiśya%}, or {%Śūdra%} may
acquire the position of a brahman. {%Bhīṣma%} said that the
brahmanhood cannot be acquired except by birth, relating
an old story of a conversation between {%Mataṅga%} and a she-
ass, etc., i.e. {%Indra-Mataṅga-saṃvāda (b%}), (XIII, {@27—29@}).—
§ 736: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} mentioned that in former times the
position of a brahman was acquired by {%Viśvāmitra%}, and
asked how king {%Vītahavya%} in ancient times succeeded in
obtaining brahmanhood. {%Bhīṣma%} told the <is>Vītahavyo-</is>
<is>pākhyāna</is> ({%b%}), (XIII, {@30@}).—§ 737: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
as to who are worthy of reverent homage, {%Bhīṣma%} repeated
the old narrative of the discourse between {%Nārada%} and
{%Vāsudeva%}, who asked him the above question. {%Nārada%}
answered: “I worship them who constantly worship {%Varuṇa%},
etc.” ({%a%}), (XIII, {@31@}).—§ 738: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} about
the merits of those persons who grant protection to living
creatures, {%Bhīṣma%} told the <is>Śyenakapotākhyāna </is>({%b%}),
(XIII, {@32@}).—§ 739: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} which act is
the most important of all those that have been laid down for
a king, {%Bhīṣma%} said it was the worship of {%brahmans%}; they
are older than P., D., men, U., and Rā., and incapable of
being vanquished by D., P., G., Rā., As., or Pś.; it is owing
to the absence of {%brahmans%} that the {%Kṣattriya%} tribes, the
{%Śakas%}, etc. (α), have become degraded into the state of
{%Śūdras%}; the great Ṛ. have said that brahmanicide is
a heinous sin (XIII, {@33@}); they have {%Soma%} for their king;
“this was said to me by {%Nārada%}”; {%Āditya%}, etc. (β), enter
the body of the brahman and take what the brahman eats;
in the house where {%brahmans%} do not eat, P. refuse to eat;
examples of {%brahmans%} (γ) who have conquered {%Kṣattriyas%};
“in this connection the old story of the conversation
between {%Vāsudeva%} and the {%Earth%},” who instructed the former,
is told; examples of discomfiture arising from acts hurtful
to the {%brahmans%} (δ), (XIII, {@34@}). {%Bhīṣma's%} characterisation
of {%brahmans%}; the {%Mekalas%}, etc. (ε), and numerous other
{%kṣattriya%} tribes have become degraded to the state of
{%Śūdras%} through the wrath of the {%brahmans%}; having dis-
regarded the {%brahmans%}, As. have been obliged to take refuge
in the depths of the ocean; through the favour of the {%brahmans%}
D. have become denizens of heaven; comparisons with
{%brahmans%} (ζ): the {%brahmans%} are incapable of being subjugated
(XIII, {@35@}).—§ 740: {%Bhīṣma%} told the old history of the
discourse between {%Śakra%} (in the guise of an ascetic—
description—on an ugly car) and As. {%Śambara%}, who ascribed
his success to his never cherishing any ill-feeling towards the
{%brahmans%}, referring to the encounter between D. and As. in
days of old; {%Śambara's%} father had obtained instruction from
[Page045-b+ 63]
{%Candramas%} ({%Soma%}, the Moon) as to how the {%brahmans%}
attain to success. {%Śakra%} began to worship the {%brahmans%},
and therefore succeeded in obtaining the supremacy of
the gods (XIII, {@36@}).—§ 741: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%},
{%Bhīṣma%} discussed the comparative eligibility of {%brahmans%} for
receiving presents; “one pays off the debt one owes to
the gods by performing sacrifices, to P. by procreating
children, to the {%brahmans%} by making presents unto them,
and to the guests by feeding them” (XIII, {@37@}).—§ 742:
Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} about the disposition of women (who
are said to be the root of all evil and exceedingly frail),
{%Bhīṣma%} told the old story of the discourse between D.-ṛ.
{%Nārada%} and the courtezan Aps. {%Iañcacūḍā%}, in ancient times,
in the region of {%Brahmán%} ({%Brāhmīṃ%}, so PCR.), (XIII, {@38@}).
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} observed that women are in possession of the
illusive power of As. {%Śambara%}, etc. (α), and the political
knowledge of {%Śukra%} and {%Bṛhaspati%}; “it seems to me that
{%Bṛhaspati%} and other great thinkers evolved the science of
politics from observation of the understanding of women”
(XIII, {@39@}).—§ 743: {%Bhīṣma%} approved of what {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
had said: “There is no creature more sinful than woman;
she is the illusion that Dai. {%Maya%} created, etc.; I am told
that all persons of the human race in course of natural progress
attain to the state of gods; this circumstance alarmed the gods;
they repaired to {%Brahmán%}, who created women by an {%Atharvan%}
rite; in a previous creation women were all virtuous; but
those that sprang from this creation by {%Brahmán%} with
the aid of an illusion became sinful; {%Brahmán%} bestowed the
desire of enjoying all kinds of carnal pleasures upon them.”
{%Bhīṣma%} repeated the old story of how, in days of yore,
{%Vipula%} had succeeded in restraining his preceptor's spouse,
i.e. <is>Vipulopākhyāna</is> ({%b%}), (XIII, {@40—43@}).—§ 744: Asked
by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} explained upon what person one
should bestow one's daughter in marriage; the different
forms of marriage (α); various ordinances about marriage,
quoting {%Prajāpati%} and {%Manu%} and the {%Maruts%} and the {%Ṛṣis%};
what constitutes or completes the union of marriage; the
passing and acceptance of a dower do not constitute marriage.
{%Bhīṣma%} referred to the opinion of {%Bāhlīka%} and his own conduct
in liberating {%Ambā%}, whom he had abducted for his brother
{%Vicitravīrya%}, having defeated the {%Māgadhas%}, etc. (β), quoting
prince {%Satyavat%} (XIII, {@44@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%}
expounded how a girl's kinsmen should act after having received
a dower if the giver goes away without marrying and does not
return for some time, comparing the instance of {%Sāvitrī%} and
quoting {%Sukratu%} (the grandson of the {%Videha%} king {%Janaka%});
the unrighteous dereliction of eternal usage is regarded as
the practice of the {%Asuras%}. Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} upon what
authority the wealth of men is inherited by others when they
happen to have daughters, {%Bhīṣma%} explained the different
rules of succession, and recited some verses sung in days
of yore by {%Yama%} about the man who sells his son or bestows
his daughter for a dower (he has to sink into seven terrible
hells named {%Kāla%}); the {%Ārṣa%} marriage is also a sale; “even
a human being with whom one has no relationship of blood
should not form the subject of sale” (XIII, {@45@}); a verse of
[Dakṣa] {%Prācetasa%}; how women should be treated; “those
houses that are cursed by women meet with destruction and
ruin as if scorched by some {%Atharvan%} rite”; {%Manu%}, on the
eve of his departure for heaven, entrusted women to the care
and protection of men; a verse sung by a princess of the
house of the {%Videha%} king {%Janaka%} on the duties of women
(XIII, {@46@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} discussed
[Page046-a+ 63]
the comparative eligibility of different kinds of sons to the
father's inheritance, quoting {%Manu%} and Ṛ., and M.-ṛ.
{%Kaśyapa%} (B. {%Kā°%}) {%Mārīca%}; “if a brahman, led by lust,
acts in a different way, he shall come to be regarded as
a {%Cāṇḍāla%} among brahmans” (XIII, {@47@}). Asked by
{%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} discussed the duties of persons born
in the mixed castes; in the beginning {%Prajāpati%} created
the four castes for the sake of sacrifice; the son begotten by
a {%brahman%} upon a {%Śūdra%} wife is called {%Pāraśava%} (etymology);
a {%Kṣattriya's%} son with a {%Śūdra%} wife is called an {%Ugra%},
etc. (γ); only the duties of the four principal castes have
been laid down in the scriptures; as regards the others,
the scriptures are entirely silent. Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%},
{%Bhīṣma%} discussed the signs by which the origin of men
of impure birth may be known (XIII, {@48@}). Asked by
{%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} discussed the different kinds of
sons: {%Niruktaja%}, etc. (δ), (XIII, {@49@}).—§ 745: Asked by
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} about compassion, etc., {%Bhīṣma%} told the
ancient story of a conversation between {%Nahuṣa%} and
M.-ṛ. {%Cyavana%}, i.e. <is>Cyavanopākhyāna</is> ({%b%}), including
<is>Cyavana-Kuśika-saṃvāda</is> (XIII, {@50—56@}).—§ 746:
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} became stupefied with grief at the thought of
the millions of men he had slaughtered; he feared that the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} would have to sink in hell, their heads hanging
downwards, and desired to practise severe penances. {%Bhīṣma%}
expounded the different rewards of different kinds of acts.
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} desired to attain the end that is reserved
to heroes, and no longer expressed any disgust at leading
a householder's mode of life, and all the {%Pāṇḍavas%} with
{%Draupadī%} approved of his words (XIII, {@57@}). Asked by
{%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} spoke of the rewards attached to
the planting of trees and the digging of wells and tanks;
D., men, G., P., U., and Rā., etc., all resort to a tank
full of water as their refuge; the same and Ṛ. all have
recourse to trees (XIII, {@58@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%},
{%Bhīṣma%} discussed what gift is distinguished before all other
gifts (XIII, {@59@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} discussed
which gift is more meritorious, that bestowed on one who
asks for it or that given to an unsoliciting person (XIII, {@60@}).
Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} explained where one meets
with the rewards attached to gifts and sacrifices, adducing
the instances of king {%Śibi%} and {%Manu%} (XIII, {@61@}). Asked by
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} what is the best of all gifts, {%Bhīṣma%} declared
it to be earth (called, therefore, {%Priyadattā%}); {%Mṛtyu%}, etc.
(α), are incapable of touching the person that makes a gift
of earth; the verse hearing which {%[Rāma] Jāmadagnya%} gave
away the whole earth to {%Kaśyapa%} is quoted; a gift of
earth is a high expiation for the sin of those who betake
themselves to {%Atharvan%} rites in order to do injuries to
others; Ā., etc. (β), applaud the man who makes
a gift of earth; he further told the old narrative of
a discourse between {%Bṛhaspati%} and {%Indra%}: having adored
{%Viṣṇu%} in 100 sacrifices, {%Indra%} put this same question to
{%Bṛhaspati%}, and was instructed by him; “that man who does
not keep a promise of a gift of earth, or who recalls it, is
tied with the noose of {%Varuṇa%} at the command of Death;
those men have never to go to {%Yama%} who honour and
worship brahmans, etc.”; that king who makes gifts of
earth sports in bliss in heaven, adored by D. and G., and
is approached by 100 Aps., etc. {%Indra%} gave the whole
earth to {%Bṛhaspati%}; if these verses are recited at a {%śrāddha%}
neither Rā. nor As. can succeed in appropriating any
share of the offerings made (XIII, {@62@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣ-%}
[Page046-b+ 63]
{%ṭhira%} as to what gifts kings should make, what gifts
immediately gratify the brahmans, what fruits attach to
them, what gifts are productive of rewards both here and
hereafter, {%Bhīṣma%} related the answer he had received from
{%Nārada%} when he put the same question to him: a gift of food
made to even a {%Cāṇḍāla%} or a dog is never lost; in a former
{%Kalpa (purā kalpe) Prajāpati%} said that food is {%amṛta%}, etc.;
{%Agni%} and {%Soma%} in the body create and maintain the vital
seed; thus the sun and wind ({%Pavanaḥ%}) and the vital seed
spring and act from food; description of the regions of
heaven reserved to those that make gifts of food (XIII, {@63@}).
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} enquired after the conjunctions of the planets
and stars in relation to gifts. {%Bhīṣma%} repeated the ancient
narrative of the discourse between {%Devakī%} and Ṛ. {%Nārada%} at
{%Dvārakā%}, where {%Nārada%} answered this very question. {%Devakī%}
in her turn told it to her daughters-in-law (XIII, {@64@}).
Various merits of various kinds of gifts, {%Bhīṣma%} referring to
{%Atri%}, etc. (γ); ghee is said to gratify {%Bṛhaspati%}, etc. (δ), (XIII,
{@65@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} commented on the
gift of sandals and shoes, and of sesame, and land, and kine,
and food; sesame seeds were created by {%Brahmán%} as the best
food of the {%Pitṛs%}, etc.; {%Āpastamba%}. etc. (ε), have all ascended
to heaven by means of making gifts of sesame seeds. Once the
gods, desirous of performing a sacrifice on the earth, repaired
to {%Brahmán%} on the {%Himavat%} and obtained from him a clod of
earth (which the {%munis%} should always adore); there came
{%Agastya%}, etc. (ζ); the gods attached one-sixth of the merit
arising from their sacrifice to the gift of earth; in days of
yore king {%Rantideva%} performed a grand sacrifice, in which an
immense number of kine were slaughtered; from the juice of
their skins the river {%Carmaṇvatī%} was formed; king {%Rantideva%},
in days of yore, ascended to heaven on account of his having
given gifts of food; the cow should never be given away for
slaughter; what kine should not be given to brahmans; he
referred to {%Parāśara%}; the seasons when gifts of food produce
particular merits (XIII, {@66@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣhṭhira%},
{%Bhīṣma%} dealt with the merits that attach to gifts of
drink, quoting {%Sāvitrī%} and {%Lomaśa%} and {%Manu%}, and mentioning
{%Śibi; Soma%}, etc. (η), has sprung from water; D. have {%amṛta%}
for their food, N. have {%Sudhā%}, P. have {%Svadhā%} (XIII, {@67@}).
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked about the merits that attach to gifts of
sesame and lamps for lighting darkness, as also of food and
robes; {%Bhīṣma%} told the narrative of the conversation between
a brahman and {%Yama%}, in ancient times, in the large town
of {%Parṇaśālā%} (inhabited by brahmans) between {%Yamunā%} and
{%Gaṅgā%}, at the foot of the {%Yamunā%} hills; one day {%Yama%}
commanded a messenger of his (description) to bring the
person named {%Śarmin%} of {%Agastya's%} race from this town
({%Agastyaṃ gotrataḥ%}), not confounding him with another of
the same {%gotra%}; he should be worshipped with respect. The
messenger did the very reverse; {%Yama%} ordered this man to
be taken back and {%Śarmin%} to be brought; the former was,
however, first instructed by {%Yama%} regarding gifts. Then
the messenger conveyed him back and fetched {%Śarmin%};
{%Yama%}, having given him the same instructions, dismissed
him to be taken back to his abode. The giver of a lamp
is regarded as benefiting the {%Pitṛs%} and {%Yama%}; it enhances
the power of vision of D., P., and one's self; citing {%Manu%}
about a gift of gems (XIII, {@68@}). {%Bhīṣma%}, at {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%}
solicitation, reverted to the topic of the merits of gifts, with
especial reference to the gift of earth; a cow should never be
given to a person that is not righteous (XIII, {@69@}). The tale
of the calamity that befell king {%Nṛga%}, who had unwittingly
[Page047-a+ 63]
taken a cow belonging to a brahman and given it away to
another brahman. Formerly, when {%Dvāravatī%} was founded
(read with B. {%niviśantyām%}), a huge lizard was seen (or met
with?) in a well; {%Kṛṣṇa%} took it out and learnt that it was
king {%Nṛga%}, who in days of old had performed many sacrifices
and repeatedly made gifts of hundreds upon hundreds of
thousands of kine to the brahmans; a brahman's cow had
accidentally come among {%Nṛga's%} and been given to another
brahman, whose weak child it nourished; neither of them
would take the most exorbitant gifts in exchange; after death,
when he came to the region of the {%Pitṛs, Yama%} let him choose
as his punishment for this little sin to become a lizard for
1,000 years, till he was rescued by {%Vāsudeva%}. Then {%Nṛga%}
mounted a celestial car and proceeded to heaven; a verse
of {%Kṛṣṇa's%} is quoted (XIII, {@70@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked
{%Bhīṣma%} to further detail the merits attainable by gifts
of kine. {%Bhīṣma%} told the old story of Ṛ. {%Uddālaki%} and
his son {%Nāciketa%}, whom he had cursed to go and see {%Yama%},
because {%Nāciketa%} had not found the articles (enumeration) he
was sent for, as they had been washed away by the current.
{%Nāciketa%} fell down, deprived of life; {%Uddālaki%} indulged in
lamentations; when the night came, {%Nāciketa%}, drenched with
his father's tears, revived, and in the midst of the {%Ṛṣis%}
told that he had been honoured in {%Yama's%} delightful palace,
which extended over 1,000 {%yojanas%}; “{%Yama%} said that I was
not dead, but had only come to see {%Yama%} in compliance
with the words of my father”; {%Yama%}, at his request,
had caused him to be mounted on a vehicle and showed
him all those delightful regions that are reserved for the
righteous (description), who make gifts in the world of men,
especially gifts of kine, etc. (considerations of propriety or
otherwise); in the absence of kine, a person by making gifts
of a substitute of kine (e.g. a cow made of ghee) wins the
merit of making gifts of kine; gifts of kine on {%kāmyāṣṭamī%},
etc.; “I then took leave of {%Yama%} and have now come back”
(XIII, {@71@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked about the regions of kine,
which are the residence of givers of kine. {%Bhīṣma%} related
the old tale of the conversation between {%Brahmán%} and {%Indra%},
who, seeing that the residents of the regions of kine surpassed
the denizens of heaven, asked {%Brahmán%} about them (XIII,
{@72@}). The comments of {%Brahmán%} to {%Indra%} on the subject of
kine, reference being made to {%Ṛṣis%}, etc. (XIII, {@73@}). Asked
by {%Indra, Brahmán%} spoke about the end of him who consciously
steals a cow or sells one from motives of cupidity. {%Bhīṣma%}
explained how {%Brahmán's%} discourse had been handed down
from {%Indra%} to {%Bhīṣma: Brahmán > Indra > Daśaratha > Rāma%}
[Dāśarathi] > {%Lakṣmaṇa >%} the {%Ṛṣis%} (while dwelling in the
woods) > from generation to generation > {%Bhīṣma's%} preceptor
> {%Bhīṣma%}. Blessing upon the reader (XIII, {@74@}). Asked
by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} explained the rewards that attach
to the observance of different kinds of vows; many millions
of Ṛ. are residing in {%Brahmaloka%} (XIII, {@75@}). Asked by
{%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} commented upon the ordinances that
regulate gifts of kine, quoting the instruction given by
{%Bṛhaspati%} to king {%Māndhātṛ%}; “kine have that in them that
partakes of the nature of both {%Sūrya%} and {%Soma%}”; application
of the words {%bhavitavyā%}, etc. (θ); all the three [cow-givers],
etc., and he who is well conversant with the {%Mahābhārata%}
attain to the regions of {%Viṣṇu%} and {%Soma%}; names of kings
who have attained to regions of great felicity as the reward
of such gifts of kine as they made according to the
instructions of {%Bṛhaspati: Uśīnara%}, etc. (ι).—{%Vaiśampāyana%}
said: King {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} did all that {%Bhīṣma%} wished; he
[Page047-b+ 63]
from that time began always to make gifts of kine and to
support himself on grains of barley and on cow-dung as his
food and drink, and he began to sleep from that day on
the bare earth, and gave up the practice of harnessing
kine to his vehicles, and used cars drawn by horses (XIII,
{@76@}). {%Vaiśampāyana%} continued: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%},
{%Bhīṣma%} once more went into detail on the merits attaching
to the gift of kine: a {%Kapilā%} cow is the best of all kine;
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked why; {%Bhīṣma%} said he had heard old
men tell the following story: In days of yore {%Brahmán%}
commanded {%Dakṣa%} to create living creatures; {%Dakṣa%}, in
the first instance, created food; he drank {%amṛta%}, a fragrant
eructation came out, and gave birth to the cow {%Surabhi%},
whose daughters came to be regarded as the mothers of the
world; they were all {%Kapilās%}; some froth from the calves
fell upon the head of {%Mahādeva%}, who, filled with wrath,
turned his third eye towards them, which produced various
complexions in them; some escaped to the region of {%Soma%}
and retained their colour. {%Dakṣa%} informed {%Śiva%} that this
froth was {%amṛta%} and not impure; {%Candramas%} (the Moon),
after drinking the {%amṛta%}, pours it out again; but it is
not, on that account, regarded as impure. {%Dakṣa%} then
presented {%Mahādeva%} with a bull and certain kine; {%Mahā-%}
{%deva%} was gratified and made that bull his vehicle, and after
the form of that bull adopted the device on his standard; it
was on that occasion also that the gods, uniting together,
made {%Mahādeva%} the lord of animals. Cows yield {%Soma%} in the
form of milk. Blessing upon the reader.—{%Vaiśampāyana%}
continued: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and his brother began to make gifts
of both bulls and cows of different colours to brahmans,
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} performing many sacrifices (XIII, {@78@}). {%Bhīṣma%}
said: In days of yore, king {%Saudāsa%} of {%Ikṣvāku's%} race
asked his {%purohita%} Ṛ. {%Vasiṣṭha%} what is most sacred and
most productive of merit; {%Vasiṣṭha%} enlarged upon the
mystery relating to kine; {%svāhā%} and {%vaṣaṭ%} are for ever
established in kine; what is meant by {%Gomatī%} (XIII, {@78@}).
Continuation of {%Vasiṣṭha's%} discourse on the pre-eminent
sanctity of kine; the diverse merits attaching to gifts of
different kinds of kine: {%Brahmaloka%}, etc. (κ), (XIII, {@79@}).
{%Vasiṣṭha%} commented on the purificatory {%mantras%} having
reference to kine; “those who make gifts of 1,000 kine,
departing from this world, proceed to the region of G. and
Aps., where there are many palatial mansions made of gold,
and {%Vasor dhārā%} (i.e. Mandākinī, Nīl.);… by giving
away a {%Kapilā%} cow, etc., one succeeds in entering the palace
of {%Yama%} that is so difficult to enter.”—{%Bhīṣma%} said:
{%Saudāsa%}, honouring these words of Ṛ. {%Vasiṣṭha%}, made gifts
of a very large number of kine unto the brahmans, and
attained to many worlds of felicity in the next life (XIII,
{@80@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked what is the most sacred of all
sacred things in the world, and which is the highest of
all sanctifying objects. {%Bhīṣma%} said: Kine are the most
excellent of all objects, etc.; {%Māndhātṛ%}, etc. (λ), always
used to give away kine in thousands, and have attained to
such regions as are unattainable even by the gods; he quoted
a discourse delivered of old. {%Śuka%} (having finished his morning
observances) asked Ṛ. {%Vyāsa%} what is the foremost of all
sacrifices, and was instructed by him, who praised kine and
described the region of kine which the blessed only attain;
Aps. always entertain them there; those regions that have
for their lords {%Pūṣan%} and the {%Maruts%} are attained to by givers
of kine; they attain to wealth like that of {%Varuṇa%} himself;
one should daily recite these {%mantras%} (μ) declared by {%Prajāpati%}
[Page048-a+ 63]
himself. [In this section {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} has repeatedly been
addressed instead of {%Śuka%}.] The man who, for a month,
subsists upon the gruel of barley picked up every day from
cow-dung, becomes free of sins as grave as the slaughter
of a brahman: after their defeat at the hands of Dai., the
gods practised this penance, owing to which they regained
their position; the efficaciousness of the {%Gomatī mantras.—%}
{%Bhīṣma%} said: From that time {%Śuka%} began to worship kine
every day (XIII, {@81@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked how it is that
the dung of the cow is possessed of {%Śrī. Bhīṣma%} told
the old story of the conversation between the kine and
{%Śrī%}, who once in a beautiful form entered a herd of cows,
saying: “The {%Daityas%}, forsaken by me, have been lost
for ever; the gods {%Indra%}, etc. (ν), having obtained me,
are sporting in joy and will do so for ever; Ṛ. and
D. only when they are favoured by me become crowned
with success”; she wished to reside in the kine;
they refused her, saying she was fickle and restless. {%Śrī%}
said: “D., Dā., G., Pś., U., Rā., and men succeed in
obtaining me only after the severest austerities”; they agreed
that she should live in their urine and dung (XIII, {@82@}).
{%Bhīṣma%} continued his discourse on kine, repeating the old
tale of the discourse between {%Brahmán%} and {%Indra%}, after
Dai. had been defeated and all creatures grew in prosperity;
then once Ṛ., G., K., U., Rā., D., As., the birds, and the
{%Prajāpatis%} all adored {%Brahmán; Nārada%}, etc. (ξ), sang, etc.
(ο); {%Indra%} asked him about the region of kine; {%Brahmán%}
said that {%Indra%} had always disregarded kine, and commented
to him on the superiority of kine. He explained to him why
kine have descended to earth: In days of yore, when in the
{%Deva-yuga%} the {%Dānavas%} became lords of the three worlds,
{%Aditi%} underwent the severest austerities (standing upon one
leg for many years) and begot {%Viṣṇu%}; seeing {%Aditi%} perform
penances, {%Surabhī%}, the daughter of {%Dakṣa%}, also underwent
austerities on {%Kailāsa%} (resorted to by D. and G.), in {%yoga%},
standing upon one leg for 11,000 years; “D., Ṛ., and M.-U.
became scorched and repaired thither with me (Brahmán); as
she did not herself ask a favour, I granted her the boon of
immortality, and that she should dwell in {%Goloka%}, while her
offspring, engaged in doing good acts, would reside in the world
of men (description of {%Goloka%}).” {%Bhīṣma%} continued: From
that time {%Śakra%} began to worship kine every day. Blessing
upon the reader, etc. (XIII, {@83@}).—§ 747: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
asked why gold, in the {%Śrutis%}, is declared to be even superior
to kine as a {%dakṣiṇā%}, and what gold is, etc. {%Bhīṣma%} related
the circumstances connected with the origin of gold: “When
my father {%Śāntanu%} was dead, I went to {%Gaṅgādvāra%} to
perform his {%śrāddha; Gaṅgā%} came and rendered me great
help (description); a handsome arm, adorned with {%aṅgadas%},
etc., rose up piercing the ground; the P. did not come in
their visible forms to take the cake; I, therefore, dis-
regarding the hand, offered the whole cake on blades of
{%kuśa%}-grass, according to rule; then the arm of my father
vanished. In that night the {%Pitṛs%} appeared to me in
a dream, pleased by my adherence to the rules, whereby
I had honoured the authority of the scriptures, etc. (α);
I had made gifts of earth and kine; now I should make gifts
of gold. Listen now to this old story, that extends the
period of life for him who listens to it; it was first recited to
{%Rāma Jāmadagnya%}, who in former days exterminated the
{%Kṣattriyas%} twenty-one times; by performing a horse-sacrifice
he became free from sin, but he still failed to attain to perfect
lightness of heart; he repaired to Ṛ. and D., then to
[Page048-b+ 63]
{%Vasiṣṭha%}, etc. (β); they told him that in days of yore {%Agni%}
burnt all the world; from his seed sprang gold; he should
make gifts of gold; {%Vasiṣṭha%} in especial commented on gold:
it is the essence of {%Agni%} and {%Soma%}, etc. (γ); such is the
teaching of the {%Smṛtis%}; in churning the entire universe
a mass of energy (i.e. gold) was found; hence gold is
superior; D., G., U., Rā., men, and Pś. keep it with care;
{%Agni%} is all the deities in one, and {%Agni%} is the essence of
gold. I formerly heard this in the {%Purāṇa%}; it represents the
speech of {%Prajāpati%} himself.” Then he related <is>Suvarṇot-</is>
<is>patti</is> ({%b%}), (XIII, {@84—85@}).—§ 748: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
(who refers to § 747{%b%}), {%Bhīṣma%} related <is>Tārakavadho-</is>
<is>pākhyāna</is> ({%b%}), (XIII, {@86@}).—§ 749: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
(who perhaps refers to § 641 = XII, {@60@} ff.), {%Bhīṣma%} ex-
plained the ordinances respecting the {%śrāddha%}. D., As., men,
G., Pś., K., every one should always worship P. P. are
worshipped before the gods. The merits and demerits of the
different lunar days for performing the {%śrāddha%}: 1st-13th
days of the bright fortnight are auspicious; all the young men
in the family of him who performs it on the 14th day meet
with death, and he himself becomes entangled in war; the day
of the new moon and 10th-13th days of the dark fortnight
are auspicious; the dark fortnight is better than the bright
one, the afternoon better than the forenoon (XIII, {@87@}).
Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} explained what, if presented
to P., becomes inexhaustible and eternal, and the periods for
which different offerings presented at {%śrāddhas%} gratify the P.,
quoting some verses [originally] sung by P. and communicated
to him by {%Sanatkumāra%}, recommending {%pāyasa%} with ghee on
the 13th day [of the dark fortnight, PCR.] under {%Maghāḥ%}
during the Sun's southward course, and, under the same con-
stellation, meat of goat, etc., and {%śrāddhas%} at {%Gayā (b%}), (XIII,
{@88@}); the different merits acquired by persons by performing
optional ({%kāmyāni) śrāddhas%} under various {%nakṣatras%}, and
which were [first] explained by {%Yama%} to {%Śaśabindu%}: by per-
forming such a {%śrāddha%} under the {%Kṛttikās%}, “a man acquires
the merit of a sacrifice after establishing the sacred fire, and
ascends to heaven with his children” (PCR.), etc. (α). Having
listened to these ordinances about the {%śrāddha, Śaśabindu%}
acted accordingly, and easily subjugated and ruled the earth
(XIII, {@89@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} explained
to what kinds of brahmans the offerings made at {%śrāddhas%}
should be given away, quoting the {%Vaikhānasa Ṛṣis%}
(XIII, {@90@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} by whom the {%śrāddha%}
was first conceived, etc., in the time when the world was
only peopled by the descendants of {%Bhṛgu%} and {%Aṅgiras%}
({%Bhṛgv-Aṅgirasake kāle%}), etc., {%Bhīṣma%} said: {%Brahmán >%}
{%Atri > Dattātreya > Nimi > Śrīmat%}. After 1,000 years
{%Śrīmat%} died, having undergone the severest austerities;
{%Nimi%}, filled with grief, collected various agreeable objects
on the 14th day of the moon, and the next morning he con-
ceived the <is>idea</is> of a {%śrāddha%}; on the day of the new moon
he invited a number of respected brahmans, <is>gave food to</is>
seven such brahmans, and made an offering of cakes of rice
to his dead son, uttering his name and family ({%nāma-gotraṃ%}).
He then became filled with regret, having done an act that was
not laid down in the scriptures [that a father had done with
reference to his son what sons ought to do with reference to
their fathers, PCR.]; he thought of {%Atri%}, who came and
comforted him, saying that this sacrifice in honour of the
{%Pitṛs%} had been laid down and its rites regulated by {%Brahmán%}
himself in days of yore: one should pour out libations to
{%Agni%}, etc. (β); the gods named {%Pitṛs%} [and] {%Uṣṇapas%} [so
[Page049-a+ 63]
B. and C.; cf. BR., v. {%Ūṣmapa%}] were created by {%Svayambhū%}
(i.e. Brahmán) and consist of seven classes ({%saptakaḥ pitṛ-%}
{%vaṃśas tu%}): when they are honoured by a {%śrāddha%}, they become
freed from sin; the {%Viśvedevas%} [sixty-four (γ) are enumerated],
having {%Agni%} for their mouth, they are eternal (? {%Kālasya gati-%}
{%gocarāḥ%}; C. {%°syāga°%}; “eternal and conversant with all that
occurs in time,” PCR.). Articles that should not be offered
at {%śrāddhas%}. From the place of a {%śrāddha%} a {%Cāṇḍāla%} and
a {%Śvapaca%} should be excluded, as also one who wears yellow
clothes ({%Kāṣāyavāsāḥ%}), a leper, an outcast ({%patitaḥ%}), etc.
Having said this to Ṛ. {%Nimi, Atri%} went back to the celestial
palace of {%Pitāmaha%} (Brahmán) (XIII, {@91@}). After {%Nimi%} had
acted in this way, M.-ṛ. performed a {%śrāddha%}. The {%Pitṛs%} and
gods became afflicted with indigestion in consequence of the
offerings ({%nivāpa%}) made by persons of the four castes. They
repaired to {%Soma%}, and thence to {%Svayambhū%} (on the summit
of {%Meru%}), and thence to {%Agni. Agni%} told them to eat those
offerings together with him. It is for this reason that in
making offerings at {%śrāddhas%} a share is first offered to {%Agni%};
then also the {%Brahma-Rākṣasas%} cannot do any injury to the
{%śrāddha%}; but the {%Rakṣases%} fly away from it (v. 4383—4).
The cake should first be offered to the [deceased] father,
then to the grandfather, then to the great-grandfather; at
each cake the {%Sāvitrī%} should be uttered ({%Somāyeti ca vaktavyaṃ%}
{%tathā pitṛmateti ca%}); a woman of another {%gotra (anyavaṃśajā%}),
etc., should not assist at a {%śrāddha%}; while crossing a river,
one should offer oblations of water to one's P., and also on
the day of the new moon ({%māsardhhe kṛṣṇapakṣasya%}); this
gives prosperity, etc.; {%Brahmán%}, etc. (δ), are great masters
of {%yoga%} and [numbered among] P. (XIII, {@92@}).—§ 750:
Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} said that brahmans who are
observant of vows not mentioned in the {%Vedas%} may eat at
{%śrāddhas%} without incurring sin; but not so those who are
observant of vows mentioned in the {%Vedas%}. Penance is not
really identifiable with fast; one should not torment one's
own body; renunciation is the best of penances; the brahman
should eat {%Vighasa%} or {%Aṃṛta%} (i.e. food that remains after the
guests, etc., have eaten); one should only eat morning and
evening at the prescribed hours, etc.; such men obtain
felicity in the abode of {%Brahmán%} in the company of Aps. and
G. If the giver happens to be unrighteous, the receiver
sinks into hell. In this connection an old tale of a con-
versation between {%Vṛṣādarbhi%} and the seven {%Ṛṣis%} is told:
<is>Bisastainyopākhyāna</is> ({%b%}) (XIII, {@93@}).—§ 751: {%Bhīṣma%}
said: In this connection the old story of the oaths on the
occasion of a {%tīrthayātrā%} [i.e. <is>Śapathavidhi</is>] is told ({%b%})
(XIII, {@94@}).—§ 752: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} by whom the
custom of giving umbrellas and sandals at {%śrāddhas%} was
introduced, {%Bhīṣma%} related the story of the discourse between
{%Jamadagni%} and {%Sūrya%} [i.e. <is>Chattropānahotpatti</is>] ({%b%}).
“Do thou, therefore, give away umbrellas and shoes to
brahmans. He who gives away a white umbrella with 100
ribs to a brahman attains to eternal felicity after death in
{%Śakra-loka%}, being respected by brahmans, Aps., and D.” (XIII,
{@95—96@}).—§ 753: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} about the duties
of a householder, {%Bhīṣma%} recited the old story of {%Vāsudeva%}
(Kṛṣṇa) and the goddess {%Pṛthivī%} (Earth), who instructed
{%Vāsudeva%} on this very topic: Ṛ., D., P., and men should be
worshipped…; he should perform an {%Agnī-Ṣoma%},
{%Vaiśvadeva%}, and {%Dhānvantarya%} offering, and separately an
offering to {%Prajānāṃ pati%}; and {%bali%} to {%Yama%}, etc. (α); he
should daily perform a {%śrāddha%} (description); he should take
his food last of all ({%śiṣṭāśī%}); he should with {%madhuparka%}
[Page049-b+ 63]
honour a king, {%ṛtvij, guru%}, father-in-law, and {%snātaka%}; in the
evening and morning he should place food on the ground for
dogs, {%śvapacas%}, and birds: this is called the {%Vaiśvadeva%} offering.
{%Vāsudeva%} acted accordingly (XIII, {@97@}).—§ 754: Asked by
{%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%}, in order to explain the gift of lamps,
flowers, and incense, told the old story of the discourse
between the Prajāpati {%Manu Svāyambhuva%} and the learned and
noble brahman {%Suvarṇa%} (so called from his golden complexion)
on the golden mountain {%Meru%}. Asked by {%Suvarṇa%} about the
above-named topic, {%Manu%} related the old history of the
discourse between {%Śukra Bhārgava%} and the {%Asura%} king {%Bali%}
{%Vairocana%}, who ruled the three worlds. Asked by {%Bali%} about
this very topic, {%Śukra%} discoursed on the plants (having {%Soma%}
for their lord), of which some are {%amṛta%} (and agreeable to the
gods, etc.) and some poison; some are acceptable to As., some
to the gods, Rā., U., Y., men, P.; garlands of water flowers
should be offered to G., N., and Y.; plants with red flowers
and keen scent and having thorns have been laid down in the
{%Atharvans%} as fit for incantation in order to injure foes, etc.;
D. become gratified with the scent of flowers, Y. and Rā.
with their sight, N. with their touch, men with all three.
Among incenses, all exudations (except that of the {%Boswellia%}
{%serrata%}) are agreeable to the gods; that of {%Aquilaria Agallocha%}
to Y., Rā., and N.; that of {%Boswellia serrata%}, etc., to Dai.,
etc. [For avoiding] {%Andhatamas%} (B. {%°aṃ ta°%}; a certain hell,
Nīl.), darkness, and the sun's southward course, one should
give lights during the sun's northward course (Nīl. and the
note of PCR., p. 477); D. are resplendent, Rā. dark; hence
one should always give lights, etc.; thereby a man attains
to the same world as the celestial lights ({%jyotiṣāṃ sālokyaṃ%}).
The merits of {%bali%}-offerings made to D., Y., U., men, {%Bhūtas%},
and {%Rā%}. Y., Rā., Pn., D., P., etc., are supported by the food
offered by the householder; the {%bali%} offered to Y. and Rā.
should be rich in blood and meat, wines and spirits, etc.; {%balis%}
with lotuses and {%utpalas%} are agreeable to N.; sesame seeds
with sugar to the {%Bhūtas%}. He who eats without first serving
brahmans and gods and guests and children, should be known
as a Rā. Thus said {%Kāvya Bhārgava%} to {%Bali%}; then {%Manu >%}
{%Suvarṇa > Nārada > Bhīṣma%} (XIII, {@98@}).—§ 755: {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%} (referring to § 754) once more questioned {%Bhīṣma%} on
this subject; {%Bhīṣma%} told the old story of the discourse
between {%Nahuṣa%} and {%Agastya%} and {%Bhṛgu%} [i.e. <is>Nahuṣopā-</is>
<is>khyāna</is>] ({%b%}) (XIII, {@99—100@}).—§ 756: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
where those men go who steal articles belonging to brahmans,
{%Bhīṣma%} related the old conversation between a {%Cāṇḍāla%} and
a {%Kṣattriya (Kṣattrabandhoḥ%}), who wondered that the old
{%Cāṇḍāla%}, whose body was besmeared with the dust raised by
dogs and asses, without minding that dust, was anxious to
wash off the small drops of milk that had fallen upon his
body; the {%Cāṇḍāla%} related that formerly some kine belonging
to a brahman were stolen, and some milk from them fell upon
some {%Soma%} plants that grew by the roadside; the king who
performed the sacrifice with this {%Soma%}, the brahmans who
drank its juice, those who had assisted at the sacrifice, and
those who drank milk, etc., in the palace of this king, had to
fall into hell, as also the sons and grandsons of those who had
stolen them, and the queen, although she treated the animals
with great care. The {%Cāṇḍāla%} himself, who had lived in the
observance of {%brahmacarya%} in that place, and whose alms
had been sprinkled with the milk of the kine, had in this
life become a {%Cāṇḍāla%}. It is for this reason that the {%Soma%}
plants become unsaleable, and the persons who sell and
who purchase them both sink into the {%Raurava-%}hell, when
[Page050-a+ 63]
they repair to the region of {%Yama%}, etc. “Behold also this
miserable dog!” In a former life the {%Cāṇḍāla%} was born
in a noble family, but out of pride he ate the meat
attached to the vertebral column of animals, and thence
he had attained to his present state; in consequence of some
meritorious act in a former life, he had retained the memory
of his previous existences. Asked by the {%Cāṇḍāla%}, the
{%kṣattriya%} told him (in order to obtain emancipation ({%mokṣa%})
from his state of a {%Cāṇḍāla%}) to give up his life for the sake
of a brahman. This the {%Cāṇḍāla%} did in a battle for protecting
a brahman's wealth, and attained to a desirable end (XIII,
{@101@}).—§ 757: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} whether there is
a difference of position among righteous men after death,
{%Bhīṣma%} related the old narrative of the conversation
between the muni {%Gautama%} and {%Indra%} [i.e. <is>Hastikūṭa</is>] ({%b%})
(XIII, {@102@}).—(†) § 758: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} what
constitutes the highest penance, {%Bhīṣma%} said that there is no
penance superior to abstention from food, and told the old
story of the conversation between king {%Bhagīratha%} and
{%Brahmán. Bhagīratha%} had transcended the world of the
gods, that of kine, and that of the {%Ṛṣis%}; beholding this,
{%Brahmán%} asked him how he had attained to that region,
where neither gods, nor G., nor men succeed in coming
without having practised the severest austerities; {%Bhagīratha%}
enumerated his sacrifices, his penances on the {%Jāhnavī%} (Gaṅgā),
etc. (α); those on the banks of {%Sarayū%}, etc. (β), he gave
away millions of kine to the brahmans. “It is not through
the merits of those acts that I have attained to this region,
but through the vow of fast, which had been known to
{%Indra%}, who had kept it secret, but which {%Bhārgava Uśanas%} had
learnt through penance († v. 5945); all brahmans and Ṛ.
gratified me, saying that I should repair to {%Brahmaloka%}.”
{%Bhagīratha%} was honoured by {%Brahmán%} (XIII, {@103@}).—§ 759:
Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} discussed the reason why,
a man's period of life being said to extend over 100 years,
one becomes short-lived or long-lived; one should awake at
the {%Brāhma muhūrta%} [i.e. at the hour when the sun is just
below the horizon, PCR.]; Ṛ. by adoring the two twilights
became long-lived; one should avoid atheism ({%nāstikyaṃ%}),
calumniating the {%Vedas%}, censuring the gods, etc.; one
should also wash one's feet before sitting down to recite
the {%Vedas%} or to eat any food; one should perform the {%homas%}
for propitiating the gods ({%śāntihomān%}) and recite the {%Sāvitra%}
mantras ({%Sāvitrāṇi ca dhārayet%}; i.e. {%mantraviśeṣān%}, Nīl.);
persons conversant with ancient history cite a {%gāthā%} sung by
{%Yama%} in days of old (about running—{%prādravati%}, B.—or
studying with uncleansed mouth); “he who studies at
forbidden times, loses his {%Veda%} and shortens his life”
(v. 5026—8); nor should one eat at the {%śrāddha%} of an enemy;
the spots of the hand named {%Brāhma tīrtha%}, etc. (α); having
drunk water thrice, etc., one should worship the P. and
gods according to the ordinances of the {%Vedas%} (v. 5065);
a brahman should perform [the {%ācamana%}] ({%samupaspṛśet%}) in
all the purificatory acts with the {%Brāhma tīrtha%} (v. 5066);
one should never perform any act in honour of P. in the night-
time (v. 5075); one should wash his head before performing
any act in honour of P. or gods (v. 5081); one should never
perform [a {%śrāddha%}] under the constellation of one's nativity,
nor under the two {%Proṣṭhapadas%}, nor under {%Āgneya%} (i.e.
{%Kṛttikāḥ%}, Nīl.), nor under fierce [{%nakṣatras%}, such as {%Aśleṣā%},
etc., PCR.], nor under those that are hostile ({%pratyariṃ%}), or
those mentioned [i.e. forbidden] in the {%Jyotiṣa%} (v. 5082—3);
a woman of the same {%pravara (samārṣāṃ%}), etc., should be
[Page050-b+ 64]
avoided [in wedding] (v. 5086); one should accomplish all
acts ordained in the {%Veda%} or by the {%Brāhmaṇas%} (v. 5092);
one should study the {%Dhanurveda%} and the {%Veda%} (v. 5100);
“you should know the science of reasoning ({%Yuktiśāstraṃ%}),
the science of words ({%Śabdaśāstraṃ%}), the {%Gāndharvaśāstra%},
and the [64] {%Kalās%}, [and] one should always hear the {%Purāṇa%}
and {%itihāsas%} and the narratives that exist ({%ākhyānāni yāni%}
{%ca%}), and the biographies ({%caritaṃ%}) of high-minded persons”
(v. 5102—3); good conduct ({%ācāraḥ%}) is superior to all lore
({%āgamānāṃ%}); this fame-producing, etc., [discourse] has been
uttered by {%Brahmán%} out of compassion on all creatures
(v. 5112) (XIII, {@104@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%}
expounded how the eldest brother should behave towards his
younger brothers and the younger ones towards the eldest;
“the {%upādhyāya%} is superior to 10 {%ācāryas%}; the father to 10
{%upādhyāyas%}; the mother to 10 fathers or [even] to the whole
earth; there is no {%guru%} equal to the mother” (v. 5126—7)
(XIII, {@105@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} if only brahmans and
{%kṣattriyas%} should observe fasts (the very {%Mlecchas%} observe
them), {%Bhīṣma%} related what Ṛ. {%Aṅgiras%} had said to him in
answer [essentially in the negative] to this same question,
indicating the merits of fast on different days and different
months (β), by which fasts the merit of different sacrifices (γ)
are acquired, or the abode of the Aps., or {%Brahmaloka%} attained;
there is no penance superior to fast: by fasts the gods became
denizens of heaven, and Ṛ. attained to the highest success
({%siddhim%}); witness {%Viśvāmitra%}, and {%Cyavana%}, etc. (δ), who
attained to heaven through fasts. In former days {%Aṅgiras%}
declared so to M.-ṛ. †* (XIII, {@106@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, saying
that sacrifices are incapable of being performed by people
that are poor, as they require a large store of diverse
kinds of articles, wherefore the merit attaching to them
can only be acquired by kings and princes, asked {%Bhīṣma%}
about acts fraught with merit equal to that of sacrifices and
capable of being performed by persons destitute of means.
{%Bhīṣma%} related the ordinances about fasts that were
promulgated by {%Aṅgiras%}; the regions attainable by them (ε)
and the sacrifices they are equal to (ζ) (XIII, {@107@}). Asked
by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} about that which is the foremost of all
{%tīrthas, Bhīṣma%} mentioned and described {%Mānasa tīrtha%} [in
the figurative sense of the soul]; but also the {%tīrthas%} of the
earth are possessed of merit; by reciting the name of a {%tīrtha%},
by bathing there, and by gladdening P. there, one casts off
one's sins and goes to heaven (v. 5365) (XIII, {@108@}). Asked
by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} as to what is the highest, etc., kind of fast,
{%Bhīṣma%} said: [A = “that man who fasts on the 12th day
of the moon in the month so called”; B = “and, for the
whole day and night, worships {%Kṛṣṇa%} as Keśava, etc.”;
C = “obtains the merits of the horse sacrifice, etc.”; D =
“and freedom from sin, etc.”]

The result of adoring {%Kṛṣhṇa%} as {%Puṇḍarīkākṣa%}, etc. (η).
At the conclusion of one's vow, one should feed a number
of brahmans or make gifts of ghee to them. {%Viṣṇu%} has
said that there is no fast superior to that (XIII, {@109@}).
{%Vaiśampāyana%} said: Approaching {%Bhīṣma%}, who was lying
on his bed of arrows, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked how one does
acquire beauty, etc. {%Bhīṣma%} said that a {%Candravrata%}
should be commenced in {%Mārgaśīrṣa%}, when the moon comes
in conjunction with {%Mūla%}:
<C n="1"/>(1) {%Mūla%} [19] <C n="2"/>being in his feet,

[The figures in brackets indicate the number in the ecliptic;
{%Abhijit%} [22] is wanting.] Then gifts of ghee to learned
brahmans; one becomes as accomplished ({%paripūrṇāṅgaḥ%}) as
the full moon (XIII, {@110@}).—§ 760: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked,
what regulates rebirth, etc. {%Bhīṣma%} directed him to ask
{%Bṛhaspati%}, as none else was capable of explaining the matter.
{%Vaiśampāyana%} said: While they were thus speaking {%Bṛhaspati%}
came from heaven; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} with {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, etc.,
honoured him; then {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked him, what is
truly the friend of mortal creatures, and what follows man
to the next world. {%Bṛhaspati%} said: Righteousness.
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked, how righteousness can accompany the
dead body. {%Bṛhaspati%} said that the soul ({%jīva%}) obtains a
new body according to its merit, {%Yama%}, etc. (α), being the
witnesses, etc. Deities dwelling in the body, viz. earth, etc.
(β). After birth {%Jīva%} receives woe and death from the
messengers of {%Yama%}; if imbued with unrighteousness, {%Jīva%} has
to go to the dominions of {%Yama%}, and after suffering great misery
there, he has to undergo rebirth as an animal, or as some
other kind of being, as declared in the {%Vedas%} and the scriptures
({%śāstre%}) with the histories ({%setihāse%}). In the regions of {%Yama%}
there are places worthy of being the abodes even of the deities,
and which are equal to {%Brahmaloka%}, but also such as are
worse than [those of animals]. Different forms in which
{%Jīva%} has to take birth in consequence of different acts (e.g.
as a {%Brahma-Rākṣasa%}; as {%Mlecchas%}). [The periods that
elapse before one recovers human existence are here generally
very short, some few months or years.] “I heard all this
in days of old from {%Brahmán%} himself in the midst of the
[Page051-b+ 63]
{%surarṣis%}” (XIII, {@111@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bṛhaspati%}
explained by what acts people, having committed sin,
attain to an auspicious end in this world and in heaven,
especially recommending gifts of food (praised by D., Ṛ., P.,
and men), citing {%Rantideva (b%}) (XIII, {@112@}). Asked by
{%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bṛhaspati%} discoursed on the six doors of
righteousness (abstention from injury, the observance of the
Vedic ritual, meditation, restraining the senses, penances,
and obedience to preceptors), saying that the man who
practises the religion of universal compassion achieves the
highest good, etc. {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: Then {%Bṛhaspati%}
ascended to heaven. [XIII, {@111—113@} are called {%Saṃsāra-%}
{%cakra%}] (XIII, {@113@}).—§ 761: {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: After
this {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, addressing {%Bhīṣma%} (lying on his bed of
arrows), said: R., D., and brahmans, led by the authority
of the {%Vedas%}, praise the religion of compassion; but how
does a man who has injured others in word, thought, and
deed, succeed in freeing himself from misery? {%Bhīṣma%}
recommended abstention from meat; meat, moreover, enslaves
the mind by taste (XIII, {@114@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (referring to
§ 749) wondered how, when abstention from injury is the
highest religion, persons should make offerings of meat
in {%śrāddhas%} in honour of P. {%Bhīṣma%} referred to the
innumerable discourses on this topic that had taken place
between Ṛ., and strongly recommended abstention from
honey and meat, referring to the seven Ṛ. ({%Saptarṣayaḥ%}),
etc. (α), and quoting {%Manu%}, etc. (β); he who eats flesh of
animals slain by others incurs the sin that attaches to the
slaughter; he who purchases flesh slays living creatures
through his wealth (the eater's demerit is, however, not so
great as the slayer's); by eating flesh left from sacrifices
[to D. and P.; v. especially {%Agastya%}] and of animals
that have been slain for feeding brahmans, one incurs
a small fault. In old time persons who wanted to attain
to regions of merit hereafter, performed sacrifices with
seeds. Especially in the month of {%Kārttika%} or in its bright
fortnight one should abstain from [honey and] meat, which
many ancient kings have done: {%Nābhāga%}, etc. (γ);
those who abstain from flesh for months or fortnights
continuously, have {%Brahmaloka%} reserved to them. (It is
by truthfulness that {%Hariścandra%} roves through heaven like
a second {%Candramas%}.) Also the kings {%Śyenacitra%}, etc. (δ), did
not eat flesh during the month of {%Kārttika%}, and, therefore,
attained to {%Brahmaloka%}, adored by G. and surrounded by
1,000 beautiful damsels. The eaters of meat go to Hell;
he who practises the religion of abstention from meat or
teaches it to others will never have to go to Hell, even if
he be exceedingly wicked in other respects* (XIII, {@115@}).
Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} what can be eaten, etc., {%Bhīṣma%}
discoursed on what is flesh, and continued the preceding
discourse, again mentioning {%Agastya%}; snakes, etc. (ε), never
hurt him who is devoted to compassion; those who are
covetous of meat are cooked in the hell called {%Kumbhipāka%};
etymology of the word {%māṃsa%} (flesh) (XIII, {@116@}).—§ 762:
Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} what end those attain to who give
up their lives in battle, though to give up life is difficult for
men, whether they are in prosperity or adversity, {%Bhīṣma%}
explained the old narrative of the conversation, in former
times, between {%Vyāsa%} and a worm: <is>Kīṭopākhyāna</is> ({%b%})
(XIII, {@117—119@}).—§ 763: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} about the
relative superiority of knowledge, penances, and gifts, {%Bhīṣma%}
told the old narrative of the conversation between {%Maitreya%}
and {%Vyāsa%}: <is>Maitreya-bhikṣā</is> ({%b%}) (XIII, {@120—122@}).—
[Page052-a+ 63]
§ 764: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} about the behaviour of good
and chaste women, {%Bhīṣma%} said: Once {%Sumanā Kaikeyī%} in
{%Devaloka%} asked the omniscient {%Śāṇḍilī%} by what course of acts
she had attained to heaven (description). {%Śāṇḍilī%} said that
it was not by wearing yellow robes or barks of trees, or by
shaving her head, or by means of matted hair, that she had
attained to this state, but by never saying any disagreeable
word to her husband; by always worshipping D., P., and
brahmans; by always obeying her mother-in-law and father-
in-law, etc. (enumeration). By adhering to this path of duty
a woman is honoured in heaven like a second {%Arundhatī%}.
Then {%Śāṇḍilī%} disappeared* (XIII, {@123@}).—§ 765: Asked by
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} which is of superior efficacy, gentleness or gifts,
{%Bhīṣma%} said that some become gratified by gentleness, others
by gifts, and related the ancient narrative of how a brahman,
who had been seized in a forest by a Rā., was released [on
account of his gentleness], after answering the question put to
him by the Rā., “Why am I pale of hue and so lean?” [a long
and very curious enumeration of causes that may render a
man pale and lean]. Rā. worshipped that brahman, and
making him his friend and bestowing wealth upon him, let
him off (XIII, {@124@}).—§ 766: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked about the
following “mysteries”: how a poor man, desirous of
achieving his own good, should act; what is the best of all
gifts, and what should be given under various circumstances;
and who are truly deserving of honour and worship.
{%Vaiśampāyana%} said: Thus questioned by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%},
{%Bhīṣma%} explained those high mysteries. {%Bhīṣma%} said:
{%Vyāsa%} explained them to me in days of yore; it is
a mystery to the very gods; {%Yama%}, by vows and {%yoga%}, had
acquired the knowledge thereof as the fruit of his penances;
what pleases each god, etc. (α). The scale of sinfulness in
the giver is this: 1 [territorial] chief = 10 courtezans;
1 courtezan = 10 drinkers of alcohol; 1 drinker = 10 oilmen;
1 oilman = 10 butchers; a king is reckoned to be half more
[sinful as a giver] than these all; hence, one should not
accept gifts from such. In the {%śrāddha%} ritual the mysteries
of D., P., and R. have been declared. Once a celestial
messenger, sent by the {%Aśvins%}, came to the court of {%Indra%}
(where men, P., and D. assembled together), and, remaining
invisible, asked {%Indra%} why sexual intercourse is interdicted
to the man who performs a {%śrāddha%} and to him who eats
a {%śrāddha%}, and to whom each of the three rice-balls offered
separately at a {%śrāddha%} should be sacrificed. D. (seated
towards the east) and P. applauded him. P. said: Lest
the P. of that man should have to lie for a whole month
on his vital seed; the first rice-ball > the water > the
moon > the other gods and P.; the second should be eaten
by the spouse; P. confer a son on him who is desirous of
a son; the third is thrown into the fire; P. grant all wishes.
The {%ṛtvij%} at a {%śrāddha%} becomes the P. of the {%yajamāna%},
and, therefore, should abstain for that day from sexual
intercourse. Ṛ. {%Vidyutprabha%} asked what the atonement
is for slaying worms, ants, snakes, sheep, deer, birds, etc.
{%Indra%} answered: “Thinking of {%Kurukṣetra%}, etc.” (β)
(specification); {%Vidyutprabha%} recommended another rite
(specification), and a “mystery” discovered by Ṛ., which
he had heard from {%Bṛhaspati%} in the presence of {%Śiva%}
(standing on one foot on a mountain, etc.). Asked by {%Indra%},
{%Bṛhaspati%} discoursed on the wicked persons who make water
facing the sun [Sūrya], etc. (γ). The D., M., and Ṛ., as to
what gifts at a {%śrāddha%} become inexhaustible. P. said: By
setting free dark-coloured bulls, by gifts of sesame seeds and
[Page052-b+ 63]
water on the day of new moon, and of lamps in the season of
rains, men free themselves from the debt to P. Asked by
{%Vṛddhagārgya%}, P. said: If a blue bull [upon being set free]
raises water with its tail, P. become gratified by that [water]
for 60,000 years; if the mud from a river bank is attached to
its horns, P. go to {%Somaloka%}; by giving lamps in the season
of rain, one shines like the moon; those who on the day
of new moon make gifts of sesame seeds and water, mixed
with honey, using a vessel of {%uḍumbara%} ({%Ficus glomerata%},
PCR. copper), have duly performed a {%śrāddha%} with its
mysteries, and get cheerful and healthy children (XIII,
{@125@}). Asked by {%Indra%} how he becomes gratified, {%Viṣṇu%}
said that he hates the destruction of brahmans; that he is
gratified by the worship of brahmans, with those who
worship and make offerings in the circle besmeared with
cow-dung (because it was with his circular disc that the Dai.
were slain), those who reverence their own feet (because it
was with his two feet that the world was covered); those
who behold a boar that has just emerged from water and on
his head carries a quantity of mud from the bank (reminding
of the form of a boar in which {%Viṣṇu%} slew {%Hiraṇyākṣa%}), or
a brahman that is a dwarf in stature ({%Viṣṇu%} having conquered
king {%Bali%} as a dwarf), have never to meet with any evil (the
explanations were given as answer to {%Indra%}). The man who
every day worships the {%aśvattha (Ficus religiosa%}) and {%gorocana%}
and the cow is considered to worship the whole universe
with D., As., and men; “staying within such, I, in my own
form, accept the worship that is offered to them; the worship
of other kind I never accept.” {%Baladeva%} points out the
importance of touching a cow, ghee, etc., at early dawn. The
gods point to the importance of using an {%uḍumbara%} vessel in
presenting offerings to D. and P. {%Dharma%} said that the
offerings in honour of D. and P. should never be given to
a brahman who has accepted service under the king, or who
rings the bell, etc.; from the house of a person from whom
a guest returns unsatisfied, P., D., and the sacred fires all
return disappointed. {%Agni%} declared that P. of one who raises
his foot to kick a cow or a brahman or a fire become filled
with fear; that D. become highly dissatisfied, and that he
himself has to be roasted in hell ({%narake pacyate%}) for 100
ages; fire refuses to accept his libations. {%Viśvāmitra%} said:
He who offers rice boiled in sugared milk to P., facing
the south, at noon, in the first “elephant shade” ({%gajacchā-%}
{%yāyāṃ pūrvasyāṃ%}, v. BR.), when in the month of {%Bhādrapada%}
[the conjunction of the moon with] {%Maghā%} takes place in the
dark fortnight, has [thereby] performed a great {%śrāddha%}
[every year] for thirteen years [in succession]. The cows
said: († v. 6042—5) that man becomes-free from his sins
who adores a cow, saying: “…in {%Brahmapura%} (the
city of Brahmán), in days of yore, thou wast present with
thy calf at the sacrifice of {%Indra%}; thou who stoodst in
{%Viṣṇupada%} and in the path of {%Agni (? Vibhāvasoḥ%}), all the
gods with {%Nārada%} call thee {%Sarvasahā%}”; he attains to the
regions ({%lokān%}) of {%Indra%}, etc. Then the seven Ṛ. circum-
ambulated {%Brahmán%}, and {%Vasiṣṭha%} asked how poor righteous
men may acquire the merits attaching to sacrifices. {%Brahmán%}
answered: If one, in the bright fortnight of the month of
{%Pauṣa%}, when {%Rohiṇī%} is in conjunction, purifying himself by
a bath, lies under the cope of heaven, clad in a single
garment, with faith and concentrated attention, and drinks
the rays of the moon, one acquires the merits of great
sacrifices. This is a high mystery (XIII, {@126@}). {%Vibhāvasu%}
recommended to offer a handful of water and {%akṣatāḥ%} (rice-
[Page053-a+ 63]
grain) with ghee to the moon on the day of the full moon,
and warns against cutting a tree or chewing a tooth-brush on
the day of the new moon, lest the {%Moon%}, P., and D. should be
offended. {%Śrī%} said that D. and P. fly away from that house
in which vessels, etc., lie scattered, and in which women are
beaten. {%Aṅgiras%} said that the offspring of that man increases
who every night for a full year stands under a {%karañjaka%} tree
with a lamp and the roots of the {%Suvarcala%} plant. {%Gārgya%}
recommended, for example, that one should always repeat
the names of the {%Puṣkara%} lakes; while the merit of even
100 sacrifices is exhausted, the merit resulting from the
performance of the duties that he has mentioned becomes
inexhaustible; a woman during her season or one whose
mother is a leper must not assist at sacred rites, or D.
will not eat the libations and P. not become gratified for
thirteen years; at a {%śrāddha%} one should also recite the
{%Bhārata. Dhaumya%} warned against broken utensils (which
mean {%Kali%} himself), broken bedsteads (which mean loss of
wealth), and trees in the house (under whose roots snakes
and scorpions find shelter); when a cock or a dog is in sight,
the gods do not eat the offerings made to them. {%Jamadagni%}
said that a man whose heart is not pure is sure to go to hell,
even if he performs a horse-sacrifice or 100 {%Vājapeyas%}; by
giving only a {%prastha%} of powdered barley with a pure heart
to a brahman, a very poor brahman attained to {%Brahmaloka%}
(XIII, {@127@}). {%Vāyu%} said that he who, during the four months
of the rainy season, offers sesames and water, etc., acquires all
the merit resulting from 100 sacrifices in which animals are
offered up to the gods. When a {%Śūdra%} ignites the sacred
fires, or women are allowed to assist at rites, one is reborn as
a {%Śūdra%}, and P. and D. are never gratified with him; as an
expiation, one should for three days pour into the sacred fire
libations of the urine of the cow mixed with cow-dung, milk,
and ghee; after a year the gods once more accept the offerings
of such a man, and P. become gratified (XIII, {@128@}). {%Lomaśa%}
warned against cohabiting with the wives of other people or
a barren woman, and against appropriating what belongs
to a brahman, or D. and P. will refuse one's offerings, etc.
On the 12th lunar day and the day of full moon, one
should every month make gifts of ghee and {%akṣata%} to
brahmans; thereby {%Soma%} and the Ocean increases, and {%Indra%}
confers one-fourth of the merit of a horse-sacrifice, and {%Soma%}
grants the fruition of one's wishes. He who, during this
{%Kaliyuga%}, at dawn, in white robes, makes gifts of a vessel
of sesame seeds to brahmans, and of water with sesame seeds
and honey to P., and who gives lamps and {%kṛśara%}, acquires,
according to the ordinance of {%Indra%}, the merit of giving cows
and land (which merit is eternal) and of an {%Agniṣṭoma%}.
This is the ancient ordinance of Ṛ., applauded by P. and D.
in heaven and {%Pitṛloka%} (XIII, {@129@}). {%Bhīṣma%} said: Ṛ., P.,
and D. then asked {%Arundhatī%} (equal to [her husband]
{%Vasiṣṭha%}; not in C.) about the mysteries of {%dharma%} [not
in C.]. {%Arundhatī%} said that {%dharma%} should never be
communicated to him who is bereft of faith, full of pride,
guilty of having slain a brahman, or who violates the bed of
his preceptor. She recommended hospitality as better than
giving hundreds of thousands of cows in {%Puṣkara%}, etc.;
he who at dawn sprinkles a cow's horns with {%kuśa-%}grass,
and causes the water to drip down upon his own head, acquires
the merit of bathing in all the {%tīrthas%} of the three worlds
(resorted to by Si. and Cā.). D. and P. applauded her.
{%Brahmán%} granted her that her penances would continually
increase. {%Yama%} related the sayings of {%Citragupta%}: On days
[Page053-b+ 63]
of the full moon and the new moon one's acts are conveyed to
the Sun; when a mortal goes into {%Pretaloka%} (the regions of
the dead), {%Vibhāvasu%} (the Sun) bears witness to all his acts;
especially in {%Jyeṣṭha-Puṣkara%} one should give a {%kapilā%} cow
to a learned brahman, on {%Kaumudī%} [the day of full moon in
the month of {%Kārttika%}]; such a man is considered to have given
100 cows with a bull, a gift which is productive of eternal
merit. They that are of little understanding become afflicted
with hunger and thirst in the regions of the dead, burning in
pain, and there is no escape for them (they who make gifts
of water, on the other hand, drink of a large river full of
excellent water), and have to enter into a thick darkness (but
{%Soma, Sūrya%}, and {%Agni%} always give light to him who has
given lamps in this world, and he blazes forth like a second
{%Sūrya%}). One should also give a pair of sandals to a deserving
brahman, and an umbrella (thereby comfortable shade is
obtained in the next world). {%Sūrya's%} hair stood on end;
applauding the sayings of {%Citragupta%}, he said to D. and P.
that these five should always be avoided: the slayer of a
brahman, the slayer of a cow, he who is addicted to sexual
intercourse with other people's wives, he who is bereft of faith,
and he who derives his living from the misbehaviour of his
wife; such persons suffer ({%pacyante%}) in hell like worms eating
pus and blood, and are avoided by P., D., {%Snātakas%}, etc. (XIII,
{@130@}). Asked by D., P., and Ṛ., the {%Pramathas%} said that men
who are rendered impure by sexual intercourse without having
previously purified themselves ({%ucchiṣṭāḥ%}), men who insult their
superiors, who eat different kinds of meat, and sleep at the foot
of a tree, he who keeps flesh under his pillow while lying down
to sleep, who places the head where his feet should be placed
(in lying down or sleeping), and who throws phlegm, etc., into
the water: “these men deserve to be slain and eaten up by
us.” Means of protection against them are: {%Gorocanā%}, [the
root of] {%vacā%} [so B.], ghee with {%akṣata%}, abstaining from meat,
ever-burning fire, the skin or teeth of a wolf, a hill-tortoise,
[the sacrificial] smoke, a cat, a tawny or black goat; those
articles are destructive of Rā. (XIII, {@131@}). {%Brahmán%} caused
D. together with {%Indra%} and P. to let the elephant {%Reṇuka%} in
{%Rasātala%} go and question the {%Diggajas%} (the elephants who
sustain the earth) about the mysteries of {%dharma%}. Asked by
{%Reṇuka%}, the {%Diggajas%} recommended a {%śrāddha%}, with gifts of
treacle and rice, on the 8th day of the dark fortnight of
{%Kārttika%}, under the conjunction of the moon with {%Āśleṣā%},
uttering certain {%mantras%} (mentioning “{%Baladeva%} and other
{%Nāgas%},” and “{%Nārāyaṇa%} when he raised the submerged
earth”), and making {%bali%} offerings of blue cloth and fragrant
unguents upon an anthill strewn with {%gajendra%} flowers at sunset.
Thereby those beings in the nether regions that bear the
weight of the upper regions become pleased, and the {%Diggajas%}
do not feel the weight of upholding the earth. By observing
this rule for a whole year, and fasting, the four castes acquire
great merit; it is equal to hospitality for 100 years to all the
elephants in the three worlds. D., P., and Ṛ. applauded
{%Reṇuka%} (XIII, {@132@}). {%Śiva%} recommended to give food to cows
every day for a month, contenting oneself with one meal
a day; he who gives food to cows even for a single day,
receives one-fourth of the merit of all his meritorious acts;
cows uphold the three worlds with D., As., and men; {%Śiva%} had
praised them in the {%Kṛta%} age; at the solicitation of {%Brahmán%}
a bull stands in his banner, and he always sports with
cows; only believers should be instructed in these mysteries
(XIII, {@133@}). {%Skanda%} recommended to smear one's body for
three days with earth from the horns of a dark-coloured bull
[Page054-a+ 63]
and then to perform one's ablutions; to offer cooked food
with honey, in an {%uḍumbara%} vessel, as {%bali%} to the moon on the
evening of the day of full-moon, which offer is accepted by
Sā., etc. (γ), and where by {%Soma%} and the Ocean increase*
(spoken by {%Viṣṇu%}). {%Bhīṣma%} said that these mysteries
(respected by D. and promulgated by {%Vyāsa%}) are even
superior to the whole earth († v. 6198), and should not be
imparted to any unbeliever, etc. (XIII, {@134@}).—§ 767:
Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} enumerated those persons from
which a brahman, a {%kṣattriya%}, a {%vaiśya%}, and a {%śūdra%} may take
his food, etc. (XIII, {@135@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%}
expounded the expiations which purify a brahman of the
sin he incurs by accepting forbidden food (especially offered
to D. and P.); without having performed his ablutions,
a brahman should not say his evening prayers, etc.; for this
reason the {%śrāddha%} has been ordained to be performed in
the afternoon (XIII, {@136@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} which
is better, charity ({%dāna%}) or devotion ({%tapas), Bhīṣma%}
enumerated the pious princes who have attained to heaven
({%lokāḥ%}) (α). “These and many other men (householders) have
attained to heaven by charity and penances, and return again
and again. As night approaches, I shall explain to thee in the
morning whatever doubts may arise in thy mind” (XIII, {@137@}).
Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (who refers to XIII, {@137@}), {%Bhīṣma%}
discoursed on the five kinds of gifts: from desire of merit,
from desire of profit, from fear, from free choice, and from
pity; {%Brahmán%} has said that one should always make gifts
according to one's power (XIII, {@138@}).—§ 768: {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%}, complaining of the distress of the time, asked {%Bhīṣma%}
to discourse on religion and profit in the presence of {%Kṛṣṇa%}
and all the kings. {%Vaiśampāyana%} said that {%Bhīṣma%} recited
the discourses on the puissance of {%Viṣṇu%} in days of yore (and
the doubt of {%Rudra%} and his spouse). Once {%Kṛṣṇa%} observed
a vow for twelve years in order to obtain a son; {%Nārada%}, etc.
(α), came there with Si., etc. (description of their seats); fire
issued from the mouth of {%Kṛṣṇa%} and consumed the summit
of the mountain with all its living creatures, then it came
back and touched his feet; he cast a benignant look upon the
mountain, which once more became adorned and peopled as
before. Asked by Ṛ., {%Kṛṣṇa%} explained that, in consequence
of his penances, his soul became transformed into fire and
repaired to {%Brahmán%} (who told it that half of the energy of
{%Śiva%} would take birth as {%Kṛṣṇa's%} son), and then went back;
“I now ask you to tell me something that is highly
wonderful, which you have heard of or seen on earth or in
heaven.” Ṛ. glorified {%Kṛṣṇa%}, and asked by them, {%Nārada%}
described the wonderful incident on {%Himavat%}, “which
was witnessed by Ṛ. on their {%tīrthayātrā%}” (XIII, {@139@}).
{%Bhīṣma%} said: Then Ṛ. {%Nārada%}, the friend of {%Kṛṣṇa%},
told the following story of the discourse between {%Śiva%}
and {%Umā%}: <is>Umā-Maheśvara-saṃvāda</is> ({%b%}) (XIII, {@140-@}
{@148@}). {%Bhīṣma%} said: {%Kṛṣṇa%} paid honour to R., who
praised {%Kṛṣṇa%}, approving of what {%Śiva%} had said of him, and
saying that they had told him [about the discourse of {%Śiva%}
with {%Umā%}], only to please him, since he had asked them;
but “there is nothing in the three worlds that is unknown
to thee.” Ṛ. took leave of {%Kṛṣṇa%}, promising him that he
would soon get an excellent son. {%Kṛṣṇa%} returned to
{%Dvārakā. Rukmiṇī%}, after the tenth month, bore a son who
is identified with {%Kāma%}, which exists in every creature and
moves within the hearts of both gods and {%Asuras%}. Praise of
{%Kṛṣṇa = Viṣṇu Trivikrama%} = the thirty-three gods with
{%Indra = Adideva%} (the first god), etc. {%Bhīṣma%} congratulated
[Page054-b+ 63]
the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, especially {%Arjuna%}, and pitied {%Duryodhana%};
many Dai. and Dā. have been slain by {%Kṛṣṇa%}, witness {%Śiva's%}
utterances ({%purāṇaṃ%}) on {%Himavat%} to Ṛ.; the greatness, etc.,
of {%Arjuna%} can only come up to one-third of that of {%Kṛṣṇa-%}
{%Bhīṣma%} consoled {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (it is Time = {%Kṛṣṇa%} who has
slain the warriors), citing {%Vyāsa%} and {%Nārada. Nārada%} and
{%Vyāsa%} have told me that “{%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna (triyugau%})
practised penances in {%Badarī%} for 10,000 years”; he mentioned
his slaying of {%Kaṃsa%}; the destruction of the {%Kurus%} is due
to {%Duryodhana%}, etc. (ε). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} remained silent; the
kings with {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, and Ṛ. with {%Nārada%}, applauded
{%Bhīṣma%} and worshipped {%Kṛṣṇa%}. When {%Bhīṣma%} had rested
and become refreshed, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} once more asked him
(XIII, {@148@}).—§ 769: {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
asked {%Bhīṣma%}: who is the one god, which the foremost
of all religions, and by what prayer does one become freed
from the bonds of birth and transmigration ({%janmasaṃsāra-%}
{%bandhanāt). Bhīṣma%} answered: “Always uttering the 1,000
names of the eternal {%Viṣṇu Puruṣottama%}, the great
{%Brahmán%}, etc., which were sung by the Ṛ.” (v. 6949 wants
in B.: {%Viṣṇor nāmasahasrasya Vedavyāso mahān ṛṣiḥ|%}
{%Chando 'nuṣṭup tathā Devo Bhagavān Devakīsutaḥ%}). Then
he enumerated <is>Viṣṇu's</is> ({%= Keśava's%} v. 7057 = {%Vāsudeva's%}
v. 7061, 7066, etc. = {%Kṛṣṇa's%} v. 7071) 1,000 <is>names</is>.*
“The moveable and immoveable world with D., As., G., Y.,
U., and Rā., is under the away of {%Kṛṣṇa%}; R., P., D., etc.,
have sprung from {%Nārāyaṇa%}; the {%Yoga%}, the {%Sāṅkhya%}, the
crafts ({%śilpāḥ%}), the {%Vedas%}, the {%Śāstras%}, etc., have sprung
from {%Janārdana%}; one should recite this hymn in praise of
{%Viṣṇu%}, composed ({%kīrttitaṃ%}) by {%Vyāsa%}” (XIII, {@149@}).—
§ 770: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} about the [mantra] which
gives righteousness and success on setting out on a journey,
or on entering [a new building], or at the commencement of
any undertaking, or in sacrifices to D. and P., etc., {%Bhīṣma%}
recited a {%mantra%} promulgated by {%Vyāsa%} and ordained by
{%Sāvitrī%}, and which purifies from all sins, and which was recited
in days of yore by the foremost Ṛ. († v. 7088—9): Salutations
({%namaḥ%}) to {%Vasiṣṭha%}, etc. (α); the eleven {%Rudras%} (the lords
of the three worlds) are: {%Ajaikapād%}, etc. (β); in {%Śatarudra%}
they are 100; {%Aṃśa%}, etc. (γ), are the twelve {%Ādityas%}, the
sons of {%Kaśyapa%} according to the {%Śruti; Dhara%}, etc. (δ), are
the eight {%Vasus; Nāsatya%} and {%Dasra%} are the two {%Aśvins%}, the
sons of {%Mārttaṇḍa%}, who came out of the nose of {%Sañjñā%};
{%Mṛtyu, Kāla%}, V.-D., P. (endowed with forms), Mu., and Si.
(devoted to penances and emancipation) are the invisible
witnesses of all the good and bad acts of all beings, giving
the regions of felicity ({%lokān etān%}) created by {%Prajāpati%} to
those that praise them, and residing in all the worlds;
by praising these 33 [i.e. 11 + 12 + 8 + 2] gods (the
lords of all hosts of beings) [and] {%Nandīśvara%}, etc. (ε), one
is cleansed of all sins; the Ṛ. [called] {%Mānavas%} are {%Yava-%}
{%krīta%}, etc. (ζ); blazing like {%Rudra, Anala%}, and the {%Vasus%},
they rejoice in heaven with the gods after having performed
good deeds on earth; the seven {%gurus%} of {%Indra%} [i.e.
presumably Yavakrīta—Bala Āṅgirasa] live in the East,
and by praising them one enjoys felicity in {%Indraloka%};
{%Unmuou%}, etc. (η), are the seven {%ṛtvijs%} of {%Dharmarāja%} [i.e.
Yama], and live in the South; {%Dṛḍheyu%}, etc. (δ), are the
{%ṛtvijs%} of {%Varuṇa%}, and dwell in the West; {%Atri%}, etc. (ι), are
the seven {%gurus%} of {%Kubera%}, and dwell in the North; there
are seven other Mu. in all the quarters, bestowers of fame, etc.;
{%Dharma%}, etc. (κ), are upholders of the earth; {%Rāma, Vyāsa%},
{%Droṇa's%} son {%Aśvatthāman%}, and {%Lomaśa%}; these are the celestial
[Page055-a+ 63]
{%munis%}, distributed into seven groups [of] seven; they are the
creators of peace [{%śānti-%}) and good ({%-svasti-%}) and the regents
of the quarters ({%diśāṃ pālāḥ%}); one should turn his face in that
direction in which one of these Ṛ. live, and take refuge with
him; they are the creators of all creatures and the purifiers
of the worlds [this is the order in B., where v. 7121: {%Rāmo%}
{%Vyāsas…%} is placed before v. 7120: {%Śānti-svastikarā%}
{%loke…%}]; {%Saṃvartta%}, etc. (including {%Sāṃkhya%} and
{%Yoga%}) (λ), have practised severe penances and are celebrated
over the three worlds; there are others resembling {%Rudra%},
in {%Brahmaloka%}, through whom the sonless obtains a son, and
the poor obtains wealth; one should also praise {%Pṛthu%}, etc.
(μ), [and] {%Sāṅkhya%} and {%Yoga, Havya%} and {%Kavya%}, and Supreme
{%Bráhman%}; one should praise them morning and evening;
then there is no fear from fire or thieves, nor from Pś. and Rā.,
etc.; P. eat that man's {%kavya%}, and the gods his {%havya%} (so B.),
who recites [these names: {%Sāvitrī%}, v. 7146, 7149, 7158;
{%mahad bráhma Sāvitrīguṇakīrtanaṃ%}, v. 7150; {%Sāvitrīṃ para-%}
{%māṃ gatiṃ%}, v. 7155; {%Sāvitrī bráhma śāśvatī%}, v. 7161] at his
rites for D. and P.; they contribute to the peace ({%śāntim%})
of all the four castes; when setting out on a journey, etc.,
on every occasion one should recite them; it is a great
mystery of Ṛ., etc. This ancient tale contains the opinion of
the accomplished ({%siddhasya) Parāśara%}, and in former days was
recited to {%Indra%}; [it is] the veritable eternal {%Bráhman%}, the
heart of all creatures and the eternal {%śruti%}; all [the princes] of
the race of {%Sūrya%} and of {%Soma%}, i.e. the {%Rāghavas%} and the {%Kurus%},
always recite it after having purified themselves ({%śucayaḥ%});
there is rescue from every calamity in always reciting [the
names of] D., seven Ṛ. ({%Saptarṣīṇāṃ%}), and {%Dhruva%}; [† v.
7157—8 are each of 38 syllables; † v. 7159—60 are each of
2×28 syllables]: the old B.-ṛ. {%Kāśyapa%}, etc. (ν), have
worshipped them; [being] the opinion of {%Bhāradvāja%} they were
obtained by the sons of {%Ṛcīka%}; having acquired them again
from {%Vasiṣṭha, Śakra%} and the {%Vasus%} vanquished all Dā.;
the man who makes a present of 100 cows with their horns
covered with gold to a learned brahman, and he who causes
the excellent {%Bhārata%} story to be always recited, these two
acquire [equal] merit; the benefits obtained by praising
{%Bhṛgu%}, etc. (ξ) (XIII, {@151@}).—§ 771: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
what course of conduct towards the various classes of persons
is regarded faultless, {%Bhīṣma%} eulogised the brahmans, who are
attentive to P., D., and guests; who eat the first portions of
{%havya%} and {%kavya%}; who by their very eating rescue the three
worlds from great fear; whose wealth consists in all the
{%śikṣās%} and the {%śruti%}; whose wrath yet burns in the {%Daṇḍaka%}
wood, etc. (XIII, {@152@}).—§ 772: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
what is the reward attached to the worship of brahmans,
{%Bhīṣma%} told the old narrative of a conversation between
{%Pavana%} (the Wind) and {%Arjuna%} [Kārtavīrya]: <is>Pavanārjuna-</is>
<is>saṃvāda</is> ({%b%}) (XIII, {@153—158@}).—§ 773: Asked by
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} about the prosperity resulting from the worship
of the brahmans, {%Bhīṣma%}, saying that the time of his death
is not distant, and that he has recited all the duties mentioned
in the {%Purāṇas%}, referred him to {%Kṛṣṇa (b%}) (XIII, {@159@}).
Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} what prosperity results from the
worship of the brahmans, {%Kṛṣṇa%} related what he in former
times in {%Dvāravatī%} had answered his son {%Pradyumna%}, who
was greatly excited by [some] brahmans and put this same
question to him; they have {%Soma%} for their king. He related
the visit of {%Durvāsas (c%}) (XIII, {@160@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
about the knowledge he had acquired from {%Durvāsas, Kṛṣṇa%}
said that he would recite that {%Śatarudrīya%} which he repeats
[Page055-b+ 63]
every morning, and which was composed by {%Prajāpati%} at
the end of his penances. Then he praised {%Śiva (d%}) (XIII,
{@161—162@}).—§ 774: {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: After {%Kṛṣṇa%}
had said these words, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} once more asked {%Bhīṣma%}
which of the two, perception ({%pratyakṣaṃ%}) or the scriptures
({%āgamaḥ%}), should be [regarded as] authoritative for arriving
at a conclusion ({%kāraṇaṃ bhavet). Bhīṣma%} answered that
to affirm that perception is the only authority (as some
persons do) is foolish; that knowledge which is derived
from reasoning can scarcely be said to be knowledge.—
Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} as to [which of these four is most
authoritative, viz.] perception ({%pratyakṣaṃ%}), inference
({%lokataḥ siddhir%}, i.e. {%anumānaṃ%}, Nīl.), the teaching of the
scriptures ({%lokaś cāgamapūrvakaḥ%}), and the various kinds of
good men's practice ({%śiṣṭācāro bahuvidhaḥ%}), he declared that as
the might of unrighteous persons causes doubts to attach to
perception, inference, and good conduct, good people who
let themselves be led by the scriptures, and who are ever
contented, should be resorted to for the solution of doubts.—
As {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} remarked that, the {%veda, pratyakṣa%}, and {%ācāra%}
being all three {%pramāṇa%} (authority) [as to what is {%dharma%},
i.e. righteousness], the one {%dharma%} would become threefold,
{%Bhīṣma%} answered that {%dharma%} is really one, though capable
of being viewed from three different points; he should not
engage in such [unfruitful] speculations, but simply follow
his instructions like a blind man, knowing that righteousness
consists in abstention from injury, truth, absence of wrath,
and liberality, and that conduct towards the brahmans that
has been observed by his sires and grandsires. The fool
who would deny that to be authority that [has always been
accepted as] authority, does not deserve to become an authority,
for he creates [only] fright.—Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%}
said that those who hate righteousness have their hearts
overwhelmed with passion and darkness and go to hell; those
who observe righteousness go to heaven. The brahmans,
who are the eldest sons of {%Brahmán%}, represent righteousness,
and, therefore, they are worshipped by the righteous as a ripe
fruit by a hungry man.—Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%}
indicated the acts that are characteristic of wicked and good
men (curious enumeration): the good never talk while eating,
and never go to sleep with wet hands; two times have been
appointed by the deities for taking food, viz. morning and
evening; in the meantime, one should not eat anything;
when following this rule, one is said to observe a fast; one
who never approaches his spouse at any other time save
after her courses, is said to observe the vow of {%brahmacarya%};
{%amṛta%}, brahmans, and kine are regarded as equal; one does
not incur any fault by eating the meat of animals slain in
sacrifices with {%mantras%} from the {%Yajurveda%}; the flesh of the
backbone, or that of animals not slain in sacrifices, is as the
flesh of one's own son; one should eat in privacy; well-
cooked frumenty, {%yāvaka%} (B. {%yavāgāṃ%}), {%kṛsara%} (C. {%°śa°%}), and
{%havis%} [should be used in] the {%Aṣṭakās%} of gods and P. and
[in] worshipping the planets; one should not shave without
calling down a blessing upon oneself; if one sneezes, he
should be blessed ({%“śataṃ jīva,”%} Nīl.) by those present;
having committed a sin, one should confess it in the presence
of those that are good; they would then destroy it; one
should achieve righteousness in private, not make a show
of righteousness; those are traders in righteousness who
draw profit from it; one should lay up for oneself a treasure
in the world to come, consisting in gifts made [here]
to deserving persons (XIII, {@163@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} observed
[Page056-a+ 63]
that the acquisition of wealth very often seems to be
independent of exertion and learning, etc.; {%Bhīṣma%} said
that when one, notwithstanding great exertion, fails to earn
wealth, he should practise severe austerities, make gifts,
abstain from cruelty, etc.; then happiness will be obtained
[in the next life]; unless seeds be sown, no crops appear;
even in the case of insects and ants, their acts [of this and
past lives] and Nature are the cause of happiness and woe
[i.e., the explanation of what seems unintelligible to
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} is to be sought for in the actions in past lives]
(XIII, {@164@}); to put faith in righteousness is the mark of
wisdom; Time [which is the supreme disposer of all things]
can never make righteousness the cause of misery, and
unrighteousness is incapable of touching righteousness, which
is protected by time; righteousness is fraught with victory
(XIII, {@165@}).—§ 775: {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: Desirous of
obtaining such goods as are destructive of sins, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
questioned {%Bhīṣma%}, who was lying on a bed of arrows.
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} said: What is beneficial for a person in
this world? how can one be freed of all one's sins?
{%Vaiśampāyana%} said: In this connection {%Bhīṣma%} recited the
names of the gods to {%Yudhiṣṭhira. Bhīṣma%} said: These
names of the gods and Ṛ., if recited morning, noon, and
evening, become purifiers of sins; then one has never to
become blind or deaf, etc., and never takes birth as an animal
or in the mixed castes, nor goes to Hell; the names of the
gods and Ṛ., etc., rivers, mountains, etc.; {%Brahmán%}, etc. (α);
the Aps. (β); learned brahmans in the eastern region (γ), in
the southern region (δ), in the western region (ε), in the
north (ζ); the principal kings (ν) (to be recited at sunset
and sunrise) (XIII, {@166@}).—§ 776: {%Janamejaya%} said: When
{%Bhīṣma%} was lying on a bed of arrows, and the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
were sitting around him, my great-grandfather {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
heard these expositions of mysteries, etc.; what else did
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} do? {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: When {%Bhīṣma%}
became silent, all the kings became silent; then {%Vyāsa%}, saying
that {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc., had now been restored to their own
nature, asked {%Bhīṣma%} to give {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} leave to return
to the city, which he did, giving {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} some final
exhortations, and friendly asking him to return when the
hour came for his death. Then {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} with his
relatives and followers set out for {%Hāstinapura%}, and entered
the city with {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Gāndhārī%}, Ṛ., the citizens, the
inhabitants of the country, and his counsellors (XIII, {@167@}).
