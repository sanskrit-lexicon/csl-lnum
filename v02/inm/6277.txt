{@Kurukṣetrakathana(ṃ)@}¦ (“relation of Kurukṣetra”).
§ 615{%kk%} (Baladevat.): The Ṛ. said to {%Bala-Rāma%}: This
{%Samantapañcaka%} is said to be the eternal northern altar of
{%Prajāpati%}; there, in days of yore, the gods performed a great
sacrifice. The R.-ṛ. {%Kuru%} had cultivated this field for many
years; hence it came to be called {%Kurukeṣetra%} (“the field of
Kuru”). Requested by {%Bala-Rāma%}, the Ṛ. related: In days
of yore {%Kuru%} was engaged in perseveringly tilling this field;
requested by {%Indra%}, he said: “Those that will die upon
this plain, shall proceed to regions of bliss after being
cleansed of their sins.” {%Śakra%}, ridiculing this, went back
to heaven. This happened repeatedly. {%Indra%} summoned the
gods, who asked him to stop {%Kuru%} by granting him a boon;
“if men, by only dying there, were to come to heaven,
without having performed sacrifices to us, our very existence
would be endangered.” {%Indra%} then came, and they agreed
that {%Kuru%} should not toil any more; but those that would
die there, having abstained from food, with all their senses
awake, and those that would perish there in battle, should
go straight to heaven. It was sanctioned by all the principal
gods, headed by {%Brahmán%}, that on earth there should
be no more sacred spot than this; those men that per-
formed austere penances here would all, after laying down
their bodies, go to {%Brahmán's%} abode; those who gave away
their wealth here would soon have their wealth doubled;
those who would reside constantly here would never have to
behold the region of {%Yama%}; those kings that would perform
great sacrifices here would reside as long in heaven as earth
would last. {%Indra%} had himself composed a verse here and
sang it: “The very dust of {%Kurukṣetra…%} shall cleanse
persons of wicked acts and carry them to heaven.” The
principal gods, {%brahmans%}, kings as {%Nṛga%}, etc., having
performed costly sacrifices here, have, after abandoning their
bodies, proceeded to heaven. The space between {%Tarantuka%}
and {%Arantuka%} and the lakes of {%Rāma (Rāmahradānāṃ%}) and
{%Macakruka%} (C. {%°kra°%}), this {%Kurukṣetra-Samantapañcaka%} is
called the northern altar of {%Prajāpati%}. All that {%Śakra%} said
was approved by {%Brahmán, Viṣṇu%}, and {%Maheśvara%} (IX, {@53@}).
