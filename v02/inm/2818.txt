{@Śukotpatti(ḥ)@}¦ (“origin of Śuka”). § 712 (Mokṣadh.):
XII, {@324—325@} (12158—12214). Questioned by Yudhiṣṭhira
about {%Śuka%}, whose mind became bent on Bráhman when
he was a mere boy, Bhīṣma answered: The Ṛ. did not make
merit depend upon age, etc., but upon the study of the
Vedas and upon tapas; the merit of 1,000 horse-sacrifices or
100 {%vājapeyas%} cannot come up to even (1/16) of the merit that
arises from {%yoga%}. Once on the summit of {%Meru, Mahādeva%}
sported with his followers and {%Pārvatī%}, while {%Vyāsa%}, devoted
to yoga and dhāraṇā, practised austerities for 100 years for
the sake of obtaining a son, subsisting on air alone, adoring
{%Mahādeva%}. Thither went Ṛ., B.-ṛ., Lp., S., V., Ā., R., {%Sūrya%},
{%Candramas, Indra%}, M., the {%Oceans%}, the {%Rivers%}, A., D., G.,
{%Nārada, Parvata, Viśvāvasu%}, Si., and Aps. This has been told
to me by {%Mārkaṇḍeya. Śiva%} granted him that he would
have a son like to {%Fire, Wind, Earth, Water%}, and {%Space%}, and
devoted to {%Bráhman%} (XII, {@324@}). {%Vyāsa%} was one day
employed in rubbing his sticks to make a fire, when he
beheld the Aps. {%Ghṛtācī%}, and fell in love with her. When
[Page220-a+ 63]
she approached, transformed into a she-parrot, he dropped
his seed, which became a son, who, from this circumstance,
came to be called by the name of {%Śuka. Gaṅgā%} came and
bathed him in her waters; G. sung, and Aps. danced, etc.
{%Viśvāvasu, Tumburu, Nā., Hāhā%}, and {%Hūhū%} eulogized the
birth of {%Śuka%}; there came Lp. with {%Śakra%}, D., D.-ṛ., and B.-ṛ.;
{%Māruta%} showered celestial flowers; {%Śiva%}, together with {%Pārvatī%},
invested {%Śuka%} with the sacred thread; {%Śakra%} gave him a
celestial {%kamaṇḍalu%} and celestial robes, etc. As soon as {%Śuka%}
was born, the Vedas, including the mysteries and abstracts
({%sarahasyāḥ sasaṅgrahāḥ%}), came to dwell in him, just as they
dwelt in his father. {%Śuka%} selected {%Bṛhaspati%} for his pre-
ceptor, remembering the universal practice. Having studied
the Vedas, the tradition ({%itihāsaṃ%}), and the state policy
({%rājaśāstrāṇi), Śuka%} returned home, after paying his pre-
ceptor the tuition fee. Adopting the vow of a brahmacārin
he practised the hardest penances, even in his childhood.
Taking no pleasure in the three modes of life (the domestic,
etc.), he only kept in view the law of emancipation
({%mokṣadharmānudarśinaḥ%}) (XII, {@325@}). (For continuation
v. {%Śukakṛti%}.)
