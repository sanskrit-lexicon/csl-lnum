{@Citrāṅgadopākhyāna(ṃ)@},¦ “episode relating to Cit-
rāṅgada.” § 166 (cf. Satyavatīlābhop.): I, {@101@}. Two
sons were born of {%Satyavatī, Citrāṅgada%} and {%Vicitravīrya%}.
Before the last had attained to majority, {%Śāntanu%} died and
ascended to heaven, {%Bhīṣma%} placed {%Citrāṅgada%} on the
throne. {%Citrāṅgada%} considered nobody his equal, not even
the gods and {%Asuras%}. Therefore the king of the {%Gandharvas%}
bearing the same name fought a three years' battle with him at
{%Kurukṣetra%} on the banks of the {%Sarasvatī%}, where {%Citrāṅgada%}
was slain; then the {%Gandharva%} ascended to heaven. {%Bhīṣma%}
installed {%Vicitravīrya%}, yet in his minority, on the throne
of the {%Kurus%} and ruled for him. (For continuation
v. Vicitravīryop.)
