[{@Chattropānahotpatti@}]¦ (“the origin of giving umbrellas
and sandals at {%śrāddhas%}”). § 752{%b%} (Ānuśāsanik.): {%Bhīṣma%}
said: In ancient times {%Jamadagni Bhārgava%} was practising
with his bow; [his wife] {%Reṇukā%} used to pick up the arrows
and bring them back to him. One day, at noontide, when
the Sun was in {%Jyeṣṭhāmūla, Reṇukā%}, her head and feet
being scorched by the heat of the Sun, rested for a moment
under a tree, whereafter {%Jamadagni%} threatened to shoot the
Sun. The Sun, in the guise of a brahman, approached him
and reminded him that the Sun produces food, etc. (XIII,
{@95@}). [Further] questioned by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} said: As
{%Jamadagni%} did not desist from his anger, the brahman reminded
him that the Sun is always in motion and cannot therefore be
pierced; {%Jamadagni%}, knowing {%Sūrya%}, said that the Sun stays
at midday for a moment. Then {%Sūrya%} sought his protection,
and {%Jamadagni%} comforted him, saying “he who would slay
one who asks for protection would transcend the simplicity that
exists in brahmans, etc. (α).” {%Sūrya%} presented him with
an umbrella and a pair of sandals, saying, “from this day the
gift of these articles in all religious rites shall be established
as an indispensable usage.” (XIII, {@96@}).
