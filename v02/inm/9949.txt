{@Sītā-Rāvaṇasaṃvāda@}¦ (“discourse between Sītā and
Rāvaṇa”). § 533 (cf. Rāmopākhyānap.). While {%Sītā%} in
{%Laṅkā%} was grieving for {%Rāma%} and was waited on by {%Rākṣasīs%},
{%Rāvaṇa%}, afflicted by the shafts of {%Kāma%}, asked her to accept
him as her lord, but was rejected. {%Sītā%} continued to dwell
there, treated with tenderness by {%Trijaṭā%} (III, {@281@}).
