{@[Rājasūyikaparvan(°va)]@}¦ (“the section relating to the
Rājasūya sacrifice,” the 25th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.).
(Cf. Rājasūyikaṃ parva.) § 286: Under {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} rule
the people were very happy, and great riches filled the
treasury. Then {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} resolved upon the celebration
of the {%rājasūya. Kṛṣṇa%} came there, having appointed
{%Ānakadundubhi%} to the command of the army. Then
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, sitting with {%Dhaumya, Kṛṣṇa-Dvaipāyana%}, his
brothers, etc., asked {%Kṛṣṇa%} to install himself in that sacrifice
or to permit the {%Pāṇḍavas%} to be installed in it. {%Kṛṣṇa%} said
that {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} ought to perform it and employ himself
(i.e. {%Kṛṣṇa%}) in some office. Then {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} caused his
minister ({%mantrin) Sahadeva%} to get the articles together that
{%Dhaumya%} might order as required for the sacrifice, and to
let {%Indrasena%} and {%Viśoka%} and {%Puru%}, with {%Arjuna%} for his
charioteer, engage in collecting food. {%Dvaipāyana%} himself
became the {%brahman%} and appointed learned brahmans as
{%ṛtvijes; Susāman%} (“the bull of the {%Dhanañjayas%}”) became
the {%sāmaga, Yājñavalkya%} the {%adhvaryu, Paila%} (the son of
{%Vasu%}) the {%hotṛ%} accompanied by {%Dhaumya%}, and their disciples
and sons the {%hotragas%} (see BR.) who uttered benedictions, etc.
Then {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} caused {%Sahadeva%} to dispatch messengers,
who invited men of the four castes. Then the brahmans
installed ({%dīkṣayāñ cakrire) Yudhiṣṭhira%} in the {%rājasūya%}
sacrifice, the guests arrived, the artificers erected habitations,
etc. Then {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} despatched {%Nakula%} to {%Hāstinapura%} in
order to fetch {%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Vidura%},
{%Kṛpa%}, etc. (II, {@33@}). Enumeration of kings who came to
{%Yudhiṣṭhira's rājasūya%} (II, {@34@}).—§ 288: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
saluted {%Kṛṣṇa-Dvaipāyana%}, etc. (α), and appointed {%Duḥśāsana%}
to attend to the food, etc., {%Aśvatthāman%} to the brahmans,
{%Sañjaya%} to the kings, {%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa%} to see what was
done and what left undone, {%Kṛpa%} to attend to the diamonds,
etc., and the dakṣiṇās; {%Vidura%} became the disburser,
{%Duryodhana%} the receiver of the tributes ({%arhaṇāni), Kṛṣṇa%}
washed the feet of the brahmans. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} performed
the sacrifice with six fires (II, {@35@}).—§ 292 (cf. Śiśupāla-
vadhaparvan): Then the sacrifice was completed, watched
by {%Kṛṣṇa%}. When the kings departed, the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, com-
manded by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, followed them to the confines of
his dominions, one after another (α). {%Kṛṣṇa%} asked leave
to go to {%Dvārakā%}, being thanked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} for his
co-operation, and having bidden farewell to {%Pṛthā%}, etc. (β),
and having performed his ablutions, etc., he walked round
the {%Garuḍa-%}bannered chariot, which {%Dāruka%} had fetched, and
ascending it set out for {%Dvāravatī%}, followed on foot by
the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, till they took leave. Now {%Duryodhana%} alone,
with king {%Subala's%} son {%Śakuni%}, remained in the assembly
house (II, {@45@}).
