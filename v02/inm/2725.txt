[{@Śrī-Vāsava-saṃvāda(ḥ)@}]¦ (“the discourse between Śrī
and Indra”). § 674{%b%} (Mokṣadh.): {%Bhīṣma%} said: {%Nārada%},
who through his penance beholds both this and the other
world at once, etc., wandered through the three worlds.
Once at dawn he performed his ablutions in the {%Gaṅgā%}
[Page216-a+ 63]
({%Dhruvadvārabhavāṃ%}), and so did {%Indra%}. They listened to the
narratives told by the great D.—ṛ. They hymned the rising
Sun, and then in the opposite direction beheld a luminous
object riding on {%Viṣṇu's%} vehicle adorned with {%Garuḍa%} and
{%Sūrya%}; it was {%Śrī%} with many Aps. (description); her names:
{%Padmā%}, etc. (α). She said that they had formerly dwelt with
the {%Asuras%} in consequence of her disposition to be bound
by truth and merit; seeing, however, that the {%Asuras%} had
assumed perverse natures, she had left them and wished to
reside with {%Indra%}. Requested by {%Indra%}, she told that she
had dwelt with the {%Asuras%} on account of their good
behaviour, but after they had fallen off from virtue, she had
deserted Dai. and Dā. and had come to {%Indra%}; “there where
I reside, the seven other goddesses (β) and {%Jayā%} as the
eighth, who love me, etc., desire to live; all of them and
myself, having deserted As., have come to thee.” D.—ṛ.,
{%Nārada%}, and {%Indra%} gave her a hearty welcome. {%Vāyu%}, the
friend of {%Agni%}, began to blow gently; all the deities assembled;
heaven began to shower nectar upon the region of {%Brahmán%},
etc.; {%Indra%} began to pour rain; no one deviated from the
path of righteousness, etc.; D., K., Y., Ra. became cheerful,
etc. (XII, {@229@}).
