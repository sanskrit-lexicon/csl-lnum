{@[Putradarśanaparvan]@}¦ (“the section relating to the
seeing of the sons,” the 96th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.;
cf. Putradarśana). § 789: {%Janamejaya%} said: Tell me what
that wonderful feat was which M.-ṛ. {%Vyāsa%} accomplished after
his promise to {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} when he had taken up his abode
in the forest with {%Gāndhārī%} and {%Kuntī%}, and after {%Vidura%} had
left his body and entered into {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, and when all the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} were in the ascetic retreat; for how many days did
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} stay with his men in the woods; on what food
did the {%Pāṇḍavas%} support themselves with their men and wives?
{%Vaiśampāyana%} said: The {%Pāṇḍavas%} passed about a month in
that forest, supporting themselves on diverse kinds of food
and drink. Then {%Vyāsa%} came there and {%Nārada%}, etc. (α);
they sat down on sacred seats [of {%kuśa%} grass] and on seats of
peacock feathers; {%Gāndhārī%}, etc. (β) also sat down; they
spoke of Ṛ., D., and As. Then {%Vyāsa%} said that he knew that
burning grief in the heart of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, etc. (γ); “let
D., G., and M.-ṛ. to-day behold the energy of my penances;
therefore tell me what wish of thine I shall grant to-day.”
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} wished to see his dead children and kinsmen,
mentioning {%Duryodhana%} and the slaughter of {%Bhīṣma%} and
{%Droṇa%}. Hearing this the grief of {%Gāndhārī%}, etc. (δ) became
fresh; {%Gāndhārī%} said that for sixteen years {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} never
had slept for grief; and also {%Kṛṣṇā%}, etc. (ε) grieved
exceedingly. {%Vyāsa%} then asked {%Kuntī%} to tell what she
wished (XV, {@29@}). {%Kuntī%} told the story of {%Karṇa's%} birth
(mentioning {%Durvāsas%}, etc.); {%Vyāsa%} promised to show her
[Page573-a+ 63]
{%Karṇa%}, and said that she had no fault in what had happened
about the birth of {%Karṇa%}; “the gods beget after five methods
(thought, word, sight, touch, and sexual union)” (XV, {@30@})
{%Vyāsa%} promised to show everyone the persons whom they
wished to see and who were in the other world (ζ); “they were
all portions of D.; both G., Aps., Pś., Gh., Rā., {%Puṇyajanāḥ%},
Si., D.-ṛ., D., and Dā. met with death on the battlefield of
{%Kurukṣetra%}”; he explained who among the dead, etc., was
what: {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} was the {%Gandharva%} king {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%},
etc. (η). They all, {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} with his ministers and the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} and Ṛ. and G., proceeded towards the Bhāgīrathī
and waited for the advent of night; at sunset they bathed
and finished their evening rites (XV, {@31@}). When night
came, {%Vyāsa%} plunged into the Bhāgīrathī for a bath, and
summoned all the deceased warriors, who all rose up from
the water with a loud uproar, everyone presenting the same
aspect that he did when clad for battle; there were {%Bhīṣma%},
etc. (θ); all of them were now robed in celestial vestments
and had brilliant earrings; they were free from all animosity,
etc.; G. sang their praises, etc.; each of them was waited
upon by bands of Aps. {%Vyāsa%} gave {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} celestial
vision; endued with celestial knowledge, {%Gāndhārī%} saw all
the slain; {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} became full of joy (XV, {@32@}).
Divested of wrath and malice, the spirits of the dead mingled
with the living in happy converse (ι). Having sported with
one another for that night they, taking leave from each other,
returned to the places they had come from (κ), {%Vyāsa%}
dismissing them within the twinkling of an eye; of Rā. and
Pś. some proceeded to the {%Uttarakurus%}, others to the gods.
With {%Vyāsa's%} permission, many widows plunged into the
waters of the Bhāgīrathī in order to accompany their deceased
lords, and proceeded to those regions where their husbands
had found their abodes. {%Vyāsa%} granted to all the men there
assembled the fruition of their wishes. People of diverse
realms, hearing of this meeting between the dead and living,
became highly delighted (XV, {@33@}).—§ 790: {%Sauti%} said:
{%Janamejaya%} filled with joy asked {%Vaiśampāyana%}, how it is
possible for persons whose bodies have been destroyed to
reappear in those very forms. {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: Acts are
never destroyed; bodies are born of acts; so also are features,
etc., quoting a {%śruti%} in the horse-sacrifice (XV, {@34@}).
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} had never beheld his own sons, but got spiritual
vision from {%Vyāsa%}, he had learnt all the royal duties, as also
the {%Vedas%} and {%Upaniṣads; Vidura%} attained to high success
through penances. {%Janamejaya%} said: If {%Vyāsa%} shows me my
father as he was when he died I may then believe all that thou
hast told me. {%Sauti%} said: Then {%Vyāsa%} brought {%Parikṣit%}
[from the other world], and {%Śamīka%} and his son {%Śṛṅgin%};
all the counsellors and ministers of the king beheld them.
{%Janamejaya%}, performing the final bath in his sacrifice, highly
rejoiced; he poured the sacred water over his father, as also
over himself; then he said to {%Āstīka%} that this his sacrifice was
fraught with many wonderful incidents; {%Āstīka%} praised
{%Vyāsa%} and the snake-sacrifice, from which {%Takṣaka%} had with
difficulty escaped, the worship of Ṛ., etc. {%Janamejaya%}
honoured {%Āstīka%}, and then asked Ṛ. {%Vaiśampāyana%} about
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} further residence in the woods (XV, {@35@}).—
§ 791: {%Janamejaya%} said: Having seen his sons, etc., what
did {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, and king {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} also, do? {%Vaiśampā-%}
{%yana%} said: Beholding that wonderful sight, the reappearance
of his children, R.-ṛ. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} became relieved of his
grief and returned to his retreat; the people and Ṛ., dismissed
by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, returned home. {%Vyāsa%} came and asked
[Page573-b+ 59]
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} to dismiss the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (“thou hast heard
discourses from Ṛ., the mysteries of D. from {%Nārada%}, etc.”),
who now had passed more than a month in the woods.
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} addressed {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} affectionately, and
dismissed him and his brothers. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} offered to
wait upon his uncle and his two mothers; {%Gāndhārī%} dissuaded
him from that step. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} said that his mind was
wholly set upon penances, as the whole earth were empty now,
etc. (α) {%Sahadeva%}, saying that he dared not leave his mother,
urged {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to return to the capital; he would
himself remain, engaged in penances and in serving the old
king and his mothers. {%Kuntī%} affectionately dissuaded her
sons from remaining with her and thereby obstructing her
penances. They then took leave of their mother and
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, who blessed and comforted {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc.
(β), and embraced them one after another. Then {%Gāndhārī%}
blessed them, and {%Kuntī%} kissed them on their heads, etc.
{%Gāndhārī%} and {%Kuntī%} embraced {%Draupadī%}, etc., and instructed
them. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} with his wives and troops and kinsmen
set out for {%Hāstinapura%} (XV, {@36@}).
