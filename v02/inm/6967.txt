[{@Maitreya-śāpa(ḥ)@}]¦ (“the curse of Maitreya”). § 315
(Āraṇyak.). {%Vyāsa%} said that the {%ṛṣi Maitreya%} would ad-
monish {%Duryodhana. Maitreya%} came, having on a {%tīrthayātrā%}
arrived at {%Kurujāṅgala%}, and having visited {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
in the {%Kāmyaka%} wood. As {%Maitreya%} advised {%Duryodhana%}
to make peace with the {%Pāṇḍavas%} now that {%Bhīma%} had slain
{%Kirmīra%}, etc., {%Duryodhana%} gave him a slight by slapping
his thigh and scratching the ground with his foot. Therefore
{%Maitreya%} cursed him, saying that {%Bhīma%} should smash that
thigh of his with his mace; this curse, however, should not
take effect if he made peace with the {%Pāṇḍavas. Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
wished to hear about the death of {%Kirmīra%}, but {%Maitreya%}
would not speak again to him, because his words were not
regarded by {%Duryodhana%}; saying that {%Vidura%} would relate
it to him, he went away. {%Duryodhana%} went out perturbed.
(III, {@10@}.)
