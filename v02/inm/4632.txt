[{@Indrajidvadha(ḥ)@}]¦ (“the slaughter of Indrajit”).
§ 541: Indrajit tied Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa in a network of
those arrows of his which he had obtained as boons. Sugrīva
and the monkeys Suṣeṇa, etc. (α), surrounded them. Vibhī-
ṣaṇa came and roused them with the Prajñāstra; Sugrīva
extracted the arrows and applied the medicine {%viśalyā%}; from
the mountain Śveta a Guhyaka of Kubera's brought water,
by rubbing one's eyes with which all invisible creatures
became visible. Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, Sugrīva, etc. (β), rubbed
their eyes. Having informed Rāvaṇa, Indrajit returned
without having completed his daily sacrifice; receiving a
hint from Vibhīṣaṇa, Lakṣmaṇa killed Indrajit. Rāvaṇa
would kill Sītā, but was dissuaded by Avindhya (III, {@289@}).
