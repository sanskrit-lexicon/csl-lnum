[{@Gāndhārīputrotpatti(ḥ)@}]¦ (“birth of Gāndhārī's sons”).
§ 180 (Sambhavap.): One day {%Dvaipāyana%}, gratified with
{%Gāndhārī's%} hospitality, granted her the boon that she should
have 100 sons (cf. § 174). She had borne the burden in her
womb for two years, when she heard that {%Kuntī%} had brought
forth a son; she then struck her womb violently, and there
came out a hard mass of flesh like an iron ball. When she
was about to throw it away, {%Vyāsa%} appeared and caused
her to put the ball of flesh, sprinkled with cool water and
divided into 101 parts (each of the size of a thumb), into 101
pots filled with clarified butter, which were placed in a
concealed spot. After having said that she should open the
covers of the pots after two years, {%Vyāsa%} retired to {%Himavat%} in
order to devote himself to asceticism. {%Duryodhana%} was younger
[Page292-b+ 63]
than {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, being born on the same day as {%Bhīma%}.
As soon as {%Duryodhana%} was born he began to cry like an ass,
and ill-portending omens appeared. {%Vidura%}, etc., in vain told
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} to abandon him. Within a month the 100 sons
of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} and one daughter were born. During the
pregnancy of {%Gāndhārī, Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} begot the {%Karaṇa%}
{%Yuyutsu%} upon a maidservant of the {%Vaiśya%} class (I, {@115@}).
