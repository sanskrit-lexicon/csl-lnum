{@[Pavana-śālmali-saṃvāda(ḥ)]@}¦ (“the discourse between
the Wind-god and the {%śālmali-%}tree”). § 654{%b%} (Āpaddh.):
{%Bhīṣma%} said: There was a lordly {%śālmali-%}tree on the
{%Himavat%}. One day {%Nārada%} praised it, saying that {%Pavana%}
must be its friend and protector, since he spared it, though
he eradicates the tallest and strongest trees (XII, {@154@}). The
{%śālmali%} said that the Wind was not its friend, but that it
was stronger itself than the Wind. {%Nārada%} warned him,
saying that the Wind was stronger than even {%Indra%}, etc.
(α) (XII, {@155@}). Informed by {%Nārada%}, the Wind came and
rebuked the {%śālmali-%}tree, saying that he had spared it because
{%Brahmán%}, while creating the world, had for a time rested
under it. The {%śālmali%} laughed and challenged the Wind
to show his power, which the Wind threatened to do next
day. When night came the {%śālmali%} reflected that all that
it had said to {%Nārada%} was false, that it was in reality weaker
than other trees, and inferior in might to the Wind; “but
in intelligence no tree is my equal” (XII, {@156@}). The
{%śālmali%} then caused all its branches to be cut off. The Wind
smiled; the {%śālmali%} felt great shame, and, remembering the
words of {%Nārada%}, repented greatly of his folly.
