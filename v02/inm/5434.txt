{@Karṇaśravas@},¦ a brahman. § 324 (Dvaitavanapraveśa):
III, {@26@}α, 986 (among the brahmans who waited upon
Yudhiṣṭhira).
<div n="P">[{@Karṇa-digvijaya(ḥ)]@} (“subjection of the earth by
Karṇa”). § 515 (Ghoṣay.). When {%Duryodhana%} had come
to {%Hāstinapura, Bhīṣma%} said to him that, as he had told
him before, this journey did not please him, and advised him
to make peace with the {%Pāṇḍavas. Duryodhana%} laughed and
sallied out with {%Śakuni%}, followed by {%Karṇa%} and {%Duḥśāsana%}.
When {%Bhīṣma%}, ashamed, had gone away, they returned and
began to consult. {%Karṇa%} complained of the partiality of
{%Bhīṣma%} for the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, and promised to conquer the world
for {%Duryodhana. Duryodhana%} gladly accepted his offer,
and on an auspicious lunar day, etc., {%Karṇa%} set out (III,
{@253@}). {%Karṇa%}, surrounded by a large army, first made
{%Drupada%} and the princes that were under him pay tribute.
He then successively conquered the north ({%Bhagadatta%}, the
kings inhabiting the {%Himavat%}), the east (the {%Aṅgas, Vaṅgas%},
{%Kaliṅgas, Maṇḍikas%} (B. {%Śuṇḍika%}), {%Mithilas, Māgadhas%},
{%Karkakhaṇḍas, Āvaśīras, Yodhyas, Ahikṣattra, Vatsabhūmi%},
{%Kevalī, Mṛttikāvatī, Mohana, Pattana, Tripurā, Kośalā%}), the
south ({%Rukmin%}, the {%Pāṇḍya%} mountain, {%Kerala, Nīla%}, the son
of {%Veṇudāri, Śaiśupāla%}, the {%Āvantyas%}, the {%Vṛṣṇis%}, etc.),
and the west ({%Yāvanas, Barbaras%}, etc.), with the {%Mlecchas%},
the mountaineers, {%Bhadras, Rohitakas, Āgneyas, Mālavas%},
{%Śaśakas, Nagnajit%}, etc. Having returned to {%Hāstinapura%}, he
was highly praised by {%Duryodhana%} and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, who sat
with {%Gāndhārī%} (III, {@254@}).
