[{@Indradarśana(ṃ)@}]¦ (“seeing Indra,” cf. Arjunābhiga-
manap.). § 330: After some time {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} taught
{%Arjuna%} in private the [Pratismṛti] science ({%upaniṣad%}, i.e.
{%rahasyavidyā%}, Nīl.; {%bráhman%}) that would reveal the whole
universe to him, and told him to practise severe austerities;
{%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (α), know the fourfold ({%catuṣpāda) Dhanur-%}
{%veda%}, the {%Brāhma%} weapon, etc.; all celestial weapons are
in the possession of {%Indra%}, imparted to him by the celestials
from fear of {%Vṛtra%}. Then {%Arjuna%} took up the {%Gāṇḍīva%},
etc., blessed by brahmans, {%Siddhas%}, and invisible spirits
({%bhūtāni%}), and by {%Kṛṣṇā%} (she said: “Let no one amongst us
be ever again born in the order of {%kṣatriyas%}, but as brahmans;
it is my great grief that in the assembly {%Duryodhana%} called
me a ‘cow’ (i.e. ‘to be enjoyed by many men,’ Nīl.); but
the grief of parting with thee is far greater”), who wished
him success from {%Dhātṛ, Vidhātṛ, Hrī, Śrī, Kīrti, Dhṛti%},
{%Puṣṭi, Umā, Lakṣmī, Sarasvatī%}, the {%Vasus, Rudras, Ādityas%},
the hosts ({%gaṇān%}) of the {%Maruts%}, the {%Viśvedevas%}, and the
{%Sādhyas%}, and wished him safety from the spirits ({%bhūte-%}
{%bhyaḥ%}) of the sky, earth, and heaven, and all other enemies;
and having walked round ({%pradakṣiṇaṃ kṛtvā%}) his brothers
and {%Dhaumya%}, he set out towards the north. All creatures
left the path of {%Arjuna%}, who was urged by the desire of
beholding {%Indra (? yuktasyaindreṇa yogena%}). He passed over
many mountains, and reached {%Himavat%} in one day by means
of his {%yoga%}; then he passed over {%Gandhamādana%}, etc., and
reached {%Indrakīla%}, walking night and day untiringly.
Here he was addressed by a voice in the skies, and beheld
{%Indra%} in the guise of a brahman, who told him to throw away
his bow as of no use there, as this was the abode only of
peaceful brahmans, and advised him to wish for heavenly
bliss ({%lokāḥ%}); but {%Arjuna%} only asked for the celestial weapons,
which {%Indra%} said he should obtain when he had seen {%Śiva%}
({%Tryakṣa, Śūladhara, Bhūteśa, Parameṣṭhin%}). Then {%Indra%}
disappeared, and {%Arjuna%} remained, devoted to {%yoga%} (III, {@37@}).
