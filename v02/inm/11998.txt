{@Vidulāputraśāsana(ṃ)@}¦ (“Vidulā's instruction of her
son”). § 10 (Parvas.): I, {@2@}, 333.—§ 568 (Bhagavady.):
The princess {%Vidulā%} one day rebuked her son {%Sañjaya%}, who,
being defeated by the king of the {%Sindhus%}, was lying
dejected. “Without wrath, as thou art, thou canst not be
counted as a man…It is better to blaze up for a moment
than to smoke for a long time…He who has not achieved
a great feat, forming the subject of men's conversation, only
increases the number of men; he is neither man nor woman
…It behoves thee not to adopt the idle, wretched,
infamous, and miserable profession of mendicancy that is
worthy only of a coward…He is a man who cherishes
wrath and does not forgive…(V, {@133@})…The followers
of the {%Sindhu%}-king are all discontented and waiting for the
distress of their master; others will come to thee with their
auxiliaries if they behold thee put forth thy prowess…
While thou wert a child, a brahman said: ‘this one, falling
into great distress, will again win greatness.’ {%Śambara%} has
said ‘there is not a more miserable state than that in which
one does not see how to procure his food from day to day’.
By slaying {%Vṛtra, Indra%} became {%Mahendra%} (“the great
Indra”), and obtained the {%soṃa%}-cup of Mahendra (v. 4562,
B.: {%Māhendraṃ ca grahaṃ lebhe%}), and the lordship of all the
worlds…Sovereignty is either the door of heaven or
{%amṛta…%} In the possession of wealth, rejoice, as before,
with the {%Sauvīra%}-maidens, and be not ruled over by the
{%Saindhava%}-maidens…Handed down by tradition from
time immemorial, the eternal essence of {%kṣatriya%}-virtues
({%kṣatrahṛdayaṃ%}) has been ordained by {%Prajāpati%} himself…
A {%kṣatriya%} should rather break than yield. He should bow
down to {%brahmans%} only and to virtue ({%dharmāya%}); he should
rule over all other orders, destroying all evil-doers” (V. {@134@}).
The son complained that the heart of his mother was made
of steel, and blamed the {%kṣatriya%}-practices. {%Vidulā%} said that
if {%Sañjaya%} was about to be stained by infamy and she did not
say it to him, her affection for him would be like that of a
she-ass for her young. He ought to have recourse to virtue
and profit (V, {@135@})…“We have many treasure-houses
unknown to thee…thou hast also more than one friend.”
Despair left {%Sañjaya's%} heart, though he was not gifted
with great intelligence. He roused himself and achieved all
that his mother had pointed out. Indeed, this history,
named {%Jaya%}, should be listened to by everyone desirous of
victory, etc. (V, {@136@}).
