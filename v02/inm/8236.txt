[{@Pativratāmāhātmyaparvan@}]¦ (“the section about the
greatness of the faithful wife”) (cf. Pativratāyā māhātmyaṃ
Sāvitryāḥ). § 545: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Mārkaṇḍeya%}
related, on account of {%Kṛṣṇā%}: The {%Madra%} king {%Aśvapati%},
the husband of {%Mālavī%}, was old and childless. After eighteen
years of vows and offerings to {%Sāvitrī, Sāvitrī%} granted him
a boon; he asked for many sons, but was promised a daughter.
She was called {%Sāvitrī%}. As nobody asked her in marriage, she
was sent to look for a husband herself (III, {@293@}). She chose
{%Satyavat%}, the son of the {%Śālva%} king {%Dyumatsena%} (the husband
of {%Śaibyā%}), who had been blinded and deprived of his kingdom
and lived as an ascetic in the forest. {%Satyavat%} equalled
{%Rantideva Sāṅkrti, Śibi Auśīnara, Yayāti%}, etc., but {%Nārada%}
said: “Within a year of this day he will die”; then {%Nārada%}
went to heaven (III, {@294@}). After her marriage {%Sāvitrī%} dressed
in bark garments, etc. (III, {@295@}). She counted the days, and
having ascertained that her husband would die on the fourth
day following, she observed a {%trirātra%} vow; on the fourth day
all the ascetics uttered benedictions that she should never
suffer widowhood; she would not eat before the sun set. She
followed {%Satyavat%} as he, taking his axe, set out for the woods
(III, {@296@}). He fell ill and slept with his head on her lap.
{%Yama%} himself—and not his emissary—came with a noose in
his hand and pulled out of the body of {%Satyavat%} a person of
the size of a thumb, bound it in the noose and proceeded
in a southern direction. {%Sāvitrī%} followed him and was granted
five boons: (1) that her father-in-law should attain his eye-
sight and be strong; (2) that her father-in-law should regain
his kingdom and never fall off from his duties; (3) that her
father should have 100 sons; (4) that she and {%Satyavat%} should
have 100 sons “begotten from both of us”; (5) that {%Satyavat%}
should be restored to life and live 400 years. {%Yama%} untied
the noose; she went back to the corpse and placed his head
on her lap. {%Satyavat%} regained his consciousness. He was
[Page545-b+ 63]
anxious about his parents, and they returned to the hermitage
(III, {@297@}). Meanwhile {%Dyumatsena%} had regained his sight,
but was anxious at not finding {%Satyavat%}. He was comforted
by the brahmans {%Suvarcas, Gautama, Bharadvāja, Dālbhya%},
{%Apastamba%}, and {%Dhaumya%}. A little while afterwards {%Satyavat%}
and {%Sāvitrī%} reached the hermitage. {%Sāvitrī%} narrated every-
thing that had happened and was praised by the ṛṣis (III,
{@298@}). Meanwhile the enemy of {%Dyumatsena%} had been slain
by his minister, and {%Dyumatsena%} then again became king of
the {%Śālvas. Sāvitrī%} after a long time gave birth to 100 sons,
and her father also got 100 sons by {%Mālavī%}. “So also {%Kṛṣṇā%}
will rescue ye all.” {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and his brothers continued
to live in the {%Kāmyaka%} forest (III, {@299@}).
