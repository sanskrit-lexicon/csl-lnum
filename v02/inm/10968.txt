{@Tripura@},¦ the triple city of the Asuras. § 11 (Parvasaṅgr.): I,
{@2@}, 543 ({%°sya nipātanaṃ%}, cf. § 606).—§ 320 (Saubhavadhap.):
III, {@22@}, 883 ({%Maheśvaraśaroddhūtaṃ papāta T°ṃ yathā%}).—
§ 334{%c%} (Antardhāna): III, {@41@}, 1703 ({%Śaṅkareṇa T°ṃ%}
{%nihataṃ yadā%}).—§ 600 (Ghaṭotkacavadhap.): VIII, {@156@},
6864 ({%pureva T°ṃ dagdhvā divi devo Maheśvaraḥ%}); {@175@}, 7979
(do.).—§ 603{%d%} (Nārayaṇāstramokṣap.). The {%Asuras%} had
three cities in heaven: one of iron (belonging to {%Vidyun-%}
{%mālin%}), one of silver (belonging to {%Tārakākṣa%}), and one of
gold (belonging to {%Kamalākṣa%}); {%Indra%} could not vanquish
them; the gods repaired to {%Rudra%} and promised him the
creatures slain in every sacrifice. {%Śiva%} then made {%Gandha-%}
{%mādana%} and {%Vindhya%} the two bamboo poles of his chariot, the
earth his chariot, {%Śeṣa%} the {%akṣa%}, the moon and sun the two
wheels, {%Elāpatra%} and {%Puṣpadanta%} the two pins of the yoke,
the {%Malaya%} mountain the yoke, {%Takṣaka%} the string for tying
the yoke to the pole, and the creatures ({%sattvāni%}) the traces
of the steeds, the four {%Vedas%} his four steeds, the {%Upavedas%} the
bridle bits, {%Gāyatrī%} and {%Sāvitrī%} the reins, {%om%} the whip
({%pratoda), Brahmán%} the driver, {%Mandara%} the bow, {%Vāsuki%} the
bowstring, {%Viṣṇu%} the shaft, {%Agni%} the arrow-head, {%Vāyu%} the
wings of the shaft (so Nīl.), {%Yama Vaivasvata%} the feathers in
[Page682-a+ 63]
its tail, lightning the whetting stone, {%Meru%} the standard.
Adored by gods and ṛṣis he adopted a posture called after
his own name, and stood immovable for 1000 years. When,
however, the three cities came together in the firmament he
shot that terrible shaft of three knots, inspired with the {%Yuga%}
fire and composed of {%Viṣṇu%} and {%Soma%}. While the triple
city began to burn, {%Pārvatī%} repaired thither to behold the
sight; she had on her lap a child having a bald head with
five tufts of hair on it; {%Indra%} endeavoured to strike the
child with the thunderbolt, but {%Mahādeva%} (i.e. the child)
paralysed his arm. {%Indra%}, with the gods, repaired to
{%Brahmán%}, who, understanding that it was {%Śiva%}, came with
them and recited a hymn (θθ). {%Mahādeva%} became gratified,
and the arm of {%Indra%} reassumed its natural state: VII, {@202@},
9570 ({%°sya vadhārthāya%}).—§ 606 (Tripurākhyāna): VIII,
{@33@}, 1415, 1416; {@34@}, 1551, 1562, 1566, 1567, 1569 (the
destruction of {%T%}. by {%Śiva%} is anew related, cf. § 603{%d%}).—
§ 730{%g%} (Upamanyu): XIII, {@14@}θ, 798 ({%vināśe…T°sya%}),
(ρ) 855 ({%yena tat T°ṃ dagdhvā%}, sc. by Śiva). Cf. XIII,
