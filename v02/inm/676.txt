{@Anudyūtaparvan@}.¦ § 302: When the {%Pāṇḍavas%} had left
Hāstinapura with all their wealth and jewels, {%Duḥśāsana%}
complained of it to {%Duryodhana%}, who, with {%Karṇa%} and
{%Śakuni%}, quoting the words of {%Bṛhaspati%} when counselling
{%Indra%} about politics, and declaring that the {%Pāṇḍavas%} would
certainly revenge themselves, prevailed upon {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
to invite them a second time to a match of gambling between
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and {%Śakuni%}, on the condition that the defeated
party should repair to the woods for twelve years, dressed in
deer-skins, and spend the thirteenth year in some inhabited
country unrecognized, and if recognized, be exiled for another
[Page056-b+ 63]
twelve years. If the {%Pāṇḍavas%} should succeed in observing
this vow for thirteen years, the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%} would in the
meantime have made alliances and have assembled an invincible
army, so that they could defeat them if they reappeared.
{%Droṇa, Somadatta, Bāhlīka, Gautama, Vidura, Aśvatthāman%},
{%Vaiśyāputra%} (i.e. {%Yuyutsu%}), {%Bhūriśravas, Bhīṣma%}, and {%Vikarṇa%}
dissuaded in vain (II, {@74@}).—§ 303: {%Gāndhārī%} reminded
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} of the counsel {%Vidura%} had given, when {%Duryo-%}
{%dhana%} was born, to kill him, and recommended him to do it
now, and not to let the gambling match take place, saying
that it would cause the destruction of the whole race of the
{%Kurus%}. But {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} could not act contrary to the
will of his sons (II, {@75@}).—§ 304: The royal messengers
overtook {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} when he had already gone a long way.
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} having said, “Although a golden animal was
an impossibility, {%Rāma%} suffered himself to be tempted by
a golden deer,” they returned. The gambling began on the
above-mentioned conditions (cf. III, 1362 ff., where the
conditions are stated somewhat differently), and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
lost (II, {@76@}). The {%Pāṇḍavas%}, casting off their royal robes,
attired themselves in deer-skins. {%Duḥśāsana%} exulted, and
exhorted {%Kṛṣṇā%} to abandon the fallen {%Pāṇḍavas%} and choose
a husband among the {%Kurus%}. As {%Bhīma%} rebuked him and
threatened to slay him with his followers, {%Duḥśāsana%}, dancing
around, said, “O cow! O cow!” {%Bhīṣma%} again swore to drink
his blood and to kill all the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%}. As the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
were going away, {%Duryodhana%} mimicked the tread of {%Bhīma%},
who then said: “I will slay {%Duryodhana%} with my mace, and
place my foot on his head. {%Dhanañjaya%} will slay {%Karṇa%},
and {%Sahadeva%} will slay {%Śakuni%}, and I will drink the blood of
{%Duḥśāsana%}.” {%Arjuna%} and {%Sahadeva%} approved of it. {%Nakula%},
“the handsomest of men,” vowed to kill all the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%}
that had insulted {%Draupadī%} (II, {@77@}).—§ 305: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
bids farewell to {%Bhīṣma, Somadatta, Bāhlīka, Droṇa, Kṛpa%},
{%Aśvatthāman, Vidura, Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%}
{%Yuyutsu, Sañjaya%}, etc. {%Vidura%} kept {%Pṛthā%} in his abode, and
consoled {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}: “Formerly thou wast instructed on
the {%Himavat%} by {%Meru-Sāvarṇi%}, in {%Vāraṇāvata%} by {%Dvaipāyana%},
on {%Bhṛgutuṅga%} by {%Rāma%}, on the {%Dṛṣadvatī%} by {%Śambhu%},
near {%Añjana%} by the great {%ṛṣi Asita%}, by {%Bhṛgu%} on the banks
of {%Kalmāṣī; Nārada%} always beholds thee, and this {%Dhaumya%}
is thy {%purohita%},—resolve to win victory like {%Indra%}, to control
thy wrath like {%Yama%}, to give in charity like {%Kuvera%}, to control
all passions like {%Varuṇa%}.” So {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} went away,
bowing to {%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa%}, (II, {@78@}). When {%Kṛṣṇā%}
took leave of {%Kuntī, Kuntī%} broke out in complaints, and
especially recommended her ever to keep her eye on {%Sahadeva%}.
When {%Kuntī%} beheld her sons clad in deer-skins, surrounded
by rejoicing foes, she embraced them and broke out in com-
plaints, asking why {%Kṛṣṇa%}, who dwells in {%Dvārakā%}, and is
without beginning and without end, does not deliver them
from such woe. “O {%Sahadeva!%} cease to go! thou art my
dearest child, O son of {%Mādrī!%}” The {%Pāṇḍavas%}, having
consoled her, set out for the woods, and {%Vidura%} led her to his
house. The ladies of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} house wept, blaming the
{%Kauravas%}; and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, anxious, sent for {%Vidura%} (II,
{@79@}).—§ 306: Questioned by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Vidura%} described
the attitude of the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, etc., when going away (α).
The citizens cried out in grief, blaming the {%Kurus%}. Flashings
of lightning and other terrible omens appeared. {%Nārada%}
appeared, surrounded by great {%ṛṣis%}, and foreboded that on
the fourteenth year thence the {%Kauravas%} would all be destroyed
by {%Bhīma%} and {%Arjuna%}. Then he disappeared through the
[Page057-a+ 63]
skies. {%Duryodhana, Karṇa%}, and {%Śakuni%} offered the kingdom
to {%Droṇa%}, who said that the {%Pāṇḍavas%} were incapable of
being slain; that they would practise the {%brahmacarya%} for
twelve years, and then return in anger; that he ({%Droṇa%})
would protect the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%}, who had sought his pro-
tection, to the best of his ability; but that he would himself
be slain by {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, whom {%Drupada%} had obtained
(together with {%Kṛṣṇā%}) from the fire by the ascetic power of
{%Yāja%} and {%Upayāja%}; “it is widely known in the world that
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} will slay {%Droṇa%}.” {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} sent {%Vidura%}
to bring the {%Pāṇḍavas%} back, or, if they did not come back, to
send them off with respect, with their weapons, cars, and
infantry, etc. (II, {@80@}).—§ 307: {%Sañjaya%} spoke to
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} about the perversity of his policy. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}
related that when {%Kṛṣṇā%} was dragged into the court the
grief was so great that the enraged brahmans did not that
evening perform their {%agnihotra%}; he also related the omens
which had appeared on the occasion, etc. (II, {@81@}).
