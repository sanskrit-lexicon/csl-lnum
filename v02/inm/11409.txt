[{@Vaivāhikaparvan@}<sup>2</sup>]¦ (“the section containing the mar-
riage of Abhimanyu and Uttarā”; the 56th of the minor
parvans of Mhbhr.). § 553. On the third day the five
{%Pāṇḍavas%}, attired in white robes after a bath, etc., entered
the palace of {%Virāṭa%} and took their seats on the thrones
reserved for kings. {%Virāṭa%} rebuked {%Kaṅka (Yudhiṣṭhira%})
for this insolence; {%Arjuna%} praised {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, saying that
there was none like him, even amongst D., As., men, Rā., G.,
Y., Ku., or M.-U., and disclosed that he was {%Yudhiṣṭhira (b%})
(IV, {@70@}). Asked by {%Virāṭa%} which of them then was {%Arjuna%},
etc., {%Arjuna%} pointed out {%Bhīma%} (β), {%Nakula%}, and {%Sahadeva%}
(both beautiful and great warriors), {%Draupadī%}, and himself.
{%Uttara%} spoke of {%Arjuna's%} prowess, and described each of them,
especially {%Arjuna%} (“it was by him that {%Bhīṣma, Droṇa%}, and
{%Duryodhana%} were vanquished”). {%Virāṭa%}, thinking he had
offended {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, offered to bestow his daughter {%Uttarā%}
on {%Arjuna%}, which was applauded by {%Uttara%}, and offered his
whole kingdom, etc., to {%Yudhiṣṭhira. Arjuna%} accepted
[Page704-b+ 63]
{%Uttarā%} as his daughter-in-law, saying that such an alliance
between the {%Matsyas%} and the {%Bharatas%} was desirable (IV, {@71@}).
Asked by {%Virāṭa%} why he himself did not wish to accept his
daughter as wife, {%Arjuna%} alleged that she had confided in
him as her father, and people might entertain suspicions
against her or him; by accepting her for {%Abhimanyu%} he
attested her purity. {%Virāṭa%} approved of it, and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
gave his assent; the latter sent invitations to {%Kṛṣṇa%}, etc.,
and so did {%Virāṭa%}. The {%Pāṇḍavas%} took up their abode at
{%Upaplavya. Arjuna%} brought over {%Abhimanyu%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%},
and many {%Daśārhas%} from the {%Ānartta%} country. The {%Kāśi%}-
king and {%Śaibya%} (friendly to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}) came, each accom-
panied by an {%akṣauhiṇī%} of troops; {%Yajñasena%} came there
with the sons of {%Draupadī%} and {%Śikhaṇḍin%}, and {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}
came with an {%akṣauhiṇī%}. All the kings that came there
were lords of {%akṣauhiṇīs%} and performers of sacrifices, etc.
Then came {%Kṛṣṇa%} (decked with garlands), {%Balarāma%}, etc.,
with {%Abhimanyu%} and his mother. And {%Indrasena%}, etc., having
lived at {%Dvārakā%} for a whole year, came with the chariots of
the {%Pāṇḍavas%}. In the train of {%Kṛṣṇa%} came also 10,000
elephants, 100 thousands of horses, 100 millions of chariots,
100 milliards of foot soldiers, and innumerable {%Vṛṣṇi%},
{%Andhaka%}, and {%Bhoja%} warriors. {%Kṛṣṇa%} gave to each of the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} numerous female slaves, etc. Then the nuptial
festival set in (description). The matrons of the {%Matsyas%}
were headed by {%Sudeṣṇā%}; but {%Kṛṣṇā%} was the foremost in
beauty, etc. {%Virāṭa%} gave [as dowry] 7,000 horses and 200
elephants, and much wealth, and offered his kingdom, etc.,
to the {%Pāṇḍavas. Yudhiṣṭhira%} gave all the wealth that
had been brought by {%Kṛṣṇa%}, etc., to the brahmans (IV, {@72@}).
