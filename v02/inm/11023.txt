{@Tuṅgaka@},¦ a sacred forest. § 371 (cf. Tīrthayātrāp.). In days
of old, when the {%Vedas%} had been lost, the ṛṣi {%Sārasvata%} of
{%Aṅgiras'%} race seated at ease on the upper garments of the
{%ṛṣis%} in the forest of {%T%}. made the {%ṛṣis%} recollect all that they
had learned before, only by distinctly pronouncing the
syllable {%om%}. There the {%ṛṣis%} and the gods, {%Varuṇa, Agni%},
{%Prajāpati, Hari Nārāyaṇa, Mahādeva%}, and {%Pitāmaha%},
appointed {%Bhṛgu%} to officiate at a sacrifice, and {%Bhṛgu%} once
more performed the {%agnyādhāna%} for all these ṛṣis, gratifying
{%Agni%} with a portion of clarified butter according to the
ordinance. A visit here destroys all sins, and dwelling there
for a month with subdued senses, etc., leads to the {%Brahmaloka%}
and delivers one's race: III, {@85@}, 8195 ({%araṇyaṃ%}).
