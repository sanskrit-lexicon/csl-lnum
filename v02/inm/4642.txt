[{@Indra-Mataṅga-saṃvāda(ḥ)@}]¦ (“the conversation
between Indra and Mataṅga”). § 735{%b%} (Ānuśāsanik.):
{%Bhīṣma%} said: Once a brahman obtained a son named
{%Mataṅga%}, who, though procreated by a person of a different
order, had, however, the rites of infancy and youth performed
according to the ordinances laid down for brahmans. His
father, desiring to perform a sacrifice, ordered him to collect
the articles, and he set out riding in a car drawn by a young
ass, that bore away the car to its mother; {%Mataṅga%} repeatedly
struck the animal with his goad on its nose; but the old
she-ass consoled it, saying, “A {%Cāṇḍāla%} it is that is driving
thee; there is no severity in a brahman.” Asked by {%Mataṅga%},
the she-ass revealed to him that his father was a {%Śūdra%}
following the profession of a barber, who begat him upon
a brahman woman excited with desire; “thou art, therefore,
a {%Cāṇḍāla%} by birth.” {%Mataṅga%} returned home, told his father
what he had heard, retired to the forest, and began to undergo
the austerest penances in order to acquire the status of
a brahman, so that he scorched the very deities. {%Indra%} came
and offered him boons, but the status of a brahman, he said,
could not be won by penances (XIII, {@27@}). {%Mataṅga%} then
stood for 100 years on one foot. {%Indra%} came once more and
said: “From the order of brute life one attains to the state
of humanity; if born as a human being, one is sure to take
birth as a {%Pukkaśa%} or a {%Cāṇḍāla%}; after 1,000 years one attains
to the status of a {%Śūdra%}; then after 30,000 years that of
a {%Vaiśya%}; after a period that is sixty times longer, that of a
{%kṣatriya%}; after a period that is sixty times longer than this, to
that of a fallen {%brahman%}; after a period 200 times as long,
to that of a brahman living by the profession of arms; after
a period 300 times as long, to that of a brahman reciting the
{%Gāyatrī%} and sacred {%mantras%}; after a period 400 times as long,
to that of a brahman conversant with the entire {%Vedas%} and
the scriptures” (XIII, {@28@}). {%Mataṅga%} then practised
austerer penances, standing on one foot for 1,000 years in
{%yoga%}-meditation. {%Indra%} once more came and said the same.
{%Mataṅga%} then repaired to {%Gayā%}, and there passed 300 years
on one foot in {%yoga%}, and was reduced to only skin and bones,
and dropped down on the ground from sheer exhaustion.
{%Indra%} came quickly; now {%Mataṅga%} accepted the boons that he
should be celebrated as {%chandodeva%}, and obtain the worship
of all women, and his fame should become unrivalled in the
three worlds (XII, {@29@}).
