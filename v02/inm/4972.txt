{@Kaca@},¦ a brahman, the son of Bṛhaspati. § 145 (Sambhavap.):
{%Janamejaya%} said: How did {%Yayāti%} get {%Devayānī? Vaiśampā-%}
{%yana%} related: In the many battles between the gods and the
{%Asuras%}, the gods had for their purohita {%Bṛhaspati Āṅgirasa%},
and the {%Asuras Uśanas Kāvya%} (i.e. {%Śukra%}). As {%Uśanas%}, by
his science {%Sañjīvinī%}, restored the fallen {%Dānavas%} to life, and
{%Bṛhaspati%} was unable to revive the fallen gods, the gods
prevailed upon {%Bṛhaspati's%} son {%Kaca%} to repair to {%Uśanas%}
and conciliate him and his daughter {%Devayānī%} and learn the
{%Sañjīvinī. K%}. then repaired to the capital of {%Vṛṣaparvan%},
the king of the {%Dānavas%}, and promising to practise {%brahma-%}
{%carya%} for 1,000 years he was accepted by {%Uśanas%} as his
[Page365-b+ 63]
pupil. Young as he was he, by singing and dancing and
playing on instruments, etc., soon gratified {%Devayānī%}. After
500 years the {%Dānavas%}, having discovered who he was, slew
him, and one time hacked his body to pieces and gave it to
wolves and jackals, another time they pounded it into paste
and mixed it with the waters of the ocean, but both times
{%Devayānī%} prevailed upon {%Uśanas%} to restore {%K%}. to life
by the {%Sañjīvinī%}, summoning him and saying, “Come.”
Then slaying him for the third time they burned the body
and mixed the ashes with the wine ({%surā%}) which {%Uśanas%}
drank. As {%Devayānī%} again asked her father to revive {%K.%},
{%Uśanas%} said: “It is of no use, as he is always killed again;
thou art always worshipped by the Bráhman (i.e. the Veda,
Nīl.), the brahmans, the gods including {%Indra%}, the {%Vasus%},
the {%Aśvins%}, the enemies of the gods and the whole world,
therefore do not grieve for a mortal.” As {%Devayānī%} said she
would starve, {%Śukra%} imparted the {%Sañjīvinī%} to {%K.%}, who, though
reduced to powder, remembered everything. {%K%}. then came
out, ripping open the stomach of {%Śukra%} and then revived
{%Śukra%} by the {%Sañjīvinī. Uśanas%} declared that henceforth that
brahman who would drink wine should be reckoned to have
committed the sin of slaying a brahman. {%K%}. stayed with
{%Śukra%} for 1,000 years (I, {@76@}). When {%K%}. was about to return
to the gods {%Devayānī%} asked him to become her husband, and
as he refused (saying that she was a sister to him) she cursed
him, saying that his science should bear no fruit. {%K%}. again
cursed {%Devayānī%}, saying that no ṛṣi's son should take her
hand, and that his science should bear fruit, if not to himself,
at least to him to whom he might impart it. Then he went to
the abode of {%Indra%}, and the gods declared that he should become
a sharer with them in sacrificial offerings (I, {@77@}): I, {@76@},
