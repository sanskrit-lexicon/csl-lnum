{@Prabhāsotpattikathana(ṃ)@}¦ (“on the origin of Pra
bhāsa”). § 615 (Baladevat.): {%Dakṣa%} had twenty-seven
daughters, married to {%Soma%}, connected with the several
constellations serving to help men in calculating time, all
beautiful; {%Rohiṇī%}, however, was the foremost in beauty.
As {%Soma%} lived long with {%Rohiṇī%}, his other wives complained
to {%Dakṣa%}, who got them reconciled. As {%Soma%}, however,
still continued to live with {%Rohiṇī%} exclusively, his other
wives once more approached {%Dakṣa%}, who now threatened to
curse him. His threats were not, however, heeded, and
when the wives complained a third time, {%Dakṣa%} cursed
{%Soma%}, so that he was affected with phthisis. His sacrifices,
etc., were in vain; the herbs became tasteless and failed to
grow, etc. The gods prevailed upon {%Dakṣa%} to withdraw
the curse on condition that {%Soma%} should behave equally
towards all his wives, and bathe in the {%tīrtha%} (sc. {%Prabhāsa%})
where the {%Sarasvatī%} mingles with the ocean, and adore
{%Mahādeva%} there; then he should during the one half of the
month wane every day and during the other wax every day.
Bathing there on the day of new moon, he was restored.
{%Dakṣa%} told {%Soma%} not to disregard women and brahmans.
{%Prabhāsa%} became the foremost of all {%tīrthas; Soma%} bathes
there on every recurring day of the new moon and regains
his form and beauty; thence comes its name {%Prabhāsa%}, because
{%Soma%} there regained his effulgence ({%prabhā%}).
