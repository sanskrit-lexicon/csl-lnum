{@Sulabhā-Janaka-saṃvāda(ḥ)@}¦ (“the conversation
between Sulabhā and Janaka”). § 709{%b%} (Mokṣadh.).
Bhīṣma related the old narrative of the discourse in days
of yore, in {%Dharma-yuga%}, between king {%Janaka Maithila%}
{%Dharmadhvaja%} (devoted to renunciation, conversant with the
Veda, the {%mokṣa-śāstra%}, etc.), whom many wise men desired
to imitate, and the female mendicant {%Sulabhā%}, who practised
{%Yoga%} and wandered over the Earth, and had heard from many
{%tridaṇḍins%} about {%Janaka%}. By her {%Yoga-%}power she assumed
a beautiful form and instantly repaired to {%Mithilā%}, and, on
pretence of begging alms, presented herself before the king,
who was surrounded by his ministers and learned scholars.
By {%Yoga%} she entered the king's consciousness by her own
consciousness ({%sattvaṃ sattvena%}). Then they conversed upon
emancipation. The king said he was a disciple of the
{%bhikṣu Pañcaśikha%} of {%Parāśara's%} race, and fully conversant
with {%Sāṅkhya%} and {%Yoga%}, etc.; {%Pañcaśikha%} had dwelt with him
for four months in the rainy season. {%Sulabhā%} enumerated
thirty principles. {%Sulabhā%} was the daughter of R-ṛ {%Pradhāna%};
in the sacrifices of her ancestors {%Indra%} used to come with
{%Droṇa%}, etc. (α); no suitable husband could be obtained for
her; therefore, she wandered over the earth alone, observant
of the practices of asceticism. {%Sulabhā%} dwelt this one night
in his person like a mendicant in an empty house (XII, {@321@}).
