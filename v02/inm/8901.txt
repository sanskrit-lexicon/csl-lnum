{@[Rājanyamahābhāgya(ṃ)]@}¦ (“the grandeur of the
kṣatriyas”). § 467 (Mārk.): To the horse-sacrifice of
king {%Aṣṭaka Vaiśvāmitri%} all kings repaired, also his brothers
{%Pratardana, Vasumanas%}, and {%Śibi Auśīnara%}. After the
sacrifice was completed, these four took {%Nārada%} on their
chariot and asked him who of them (as they were all blessed
with long life and virtuous) should first fall from Heaven?
{%Nārada%} answered that {%Aṣṭaka%} should first come down,
because he had praised himself for having given away
thousands of kine; then {%Pratardana%}, because he, though
he had given to {%brahmans%} successively the four horses yoked
to his chariot, and then had drawn the chariot himself, had
done so with detraction ({%asūyati%}); then {%Vasumanas%}, because
he, though he had twice at the {%svastivācana%} for the sake
of a flowery chariot ({%puṣparathasya%}, v. 13313, see the note
of PCR., p. 601) given the chariot to {%Nārada%}, because he
praised it, had not done so on a third occasion; {%Nārada%}
himself would come down before {%Śibi%}, because {%Śibi%}, at the
request of {%Vidhātṛ%} in the disguise of a {%brahman%}, who was
desirous of trying {%Śibi%}, had cooked his son {%Bṛhadgarbha%} as
food for the {%brahman%} without being angry, though the {%brahman%}
meanwhile had set fire to {%Śibi's%} abode and treasury and
arsenal, and when the {%brahman%} ordered {%Śibi%} himself to eat
his son's body {%Śibi%} was willing to do it; but the {%brahman%}
said, “Thou hast conquered wrath, there is nothing that
thou canst not give to the {%brahmans%},” and withdrew his
hand, and then {%Śibi%} beheld his son like a child of the gods,
while the {%brahman%} disappeared; and that {%Śibi%} had not done
this for fame or wealth, etc., but because this is not practised
by the sinful (III, {@198@}).
