{@Airāvata@}<sup>4</sup>,¦ a varṣa. § 574 (Jambūkh.): VI, {@6@}, 232; {@8@},
296. On the north of {%Śṛṅgavat%} and up to the border of the
sea is the {%Varṣa Airāvata%}, superior to all because of the
peak (see the note of PCR., p. 28). The sun gives no heat
there, and the men are not subject to decay; the moon with
the stars is the only source of light. The men have the
complexion and the fragrance of the lotus, their eyes do not
wink, without food, with agreeable scent, fallen from {%Devaloka%},
without passions ({%virajaso%}), living for 13,000 years.
