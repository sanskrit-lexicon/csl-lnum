{@Śārṅgakopākhyana(ṃ)@}¦ (“episode relating to the śārṅ-
gaka birds”). § 259 (Khāṇḍavad.): {%Janamejaya%} said: “Why
did the {%śārṅgakas%} escape?” {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: When the
{%maharṣi Mandapāla%}, who was an {%ūrdhvaretas%}, had finished
his {%tapas%}, he left his body and went to {%Pitṛloka%}, but did not
obtain the expected result of his acts, and learned from the
gods sitting around {%Dharmarāja%} that it was because he had
no offspring. He then reflected how he could obtain numerous
offspring in the shortest time possible; he learnt that the
birds were peculiarly prolific, and, becoming a {%śārṅgika%},
he married the {%śārṅgikā Jaritā%}, and begat upon her four
sons, who were all reciters of the {%Vedas%}. Then he left
her and married {%Lapitā%}. When {%Agni%} came to the forest
of {%Khāṇḍava%} to burn it down, {%Mandapāla%} praised {%Agni%}
(vv. 8353—8360) and prevailed upon him to spare his children
(I, {@229@}). {%Jaritā%} told her sons ({%Jaritāri, Sārisṛkva, Stamba-%}
{%mitra%}, and {%Droṇa%}), who would have her to rescue herself by
abandoning them, to conceal themselves in the hole of a mouse;
but they were afraid of the mouse (I, {@230@}). Finally {%Jaritā%}
was prevailed upon by her sons to abandon them, and {%Agni%}
approached the spot where the sons were (I, {@231@}). The four
young {%ṛṣis%} praised {%Agni%}, who promised them safety and
granted them a boon. {%Droṇa%} asked him to consume the cats
that troubled them every day (I, {@232@}). Mean while {%Manda-%}
{%pāla%} addressed {%Lapitā%}, being anxious about his children.
{%Lapitā%}, from jealousy, told him to go to {%Jaritā%}, who, she
said, was the real cause of his anxiety. When {%Agni%} had
spared the children, {%Jaritā%} came and embraced them. When
{%Mandapāla%} came they did not speak to him, and {%Jaritā%}, from
jealousy, told him to go to {%Lapitā. Mandapāla%} declared that
nothing was so destructive to the happiness of women as
a concubine, except a lover; witness {%Arundhatī (b%}). Then
all his children came forward to worship him, and he also
spoke kindly to them all (I, {@233@}). {%Mandapāla%} told that
[Page197-a+ 63]
he had asked {%Agni%} to protect them, and therefore he had not
come earlier. Then he took his wives and sons with him and
went away to some other country (I, {@234@}).
