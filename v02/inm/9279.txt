{@Sahasrapad@}<sup>1</sup>,¦ a ṛṣi. § 24 (cf. Paulomap.): One day {%Ruru%}
in consequence of his vote for the destruction of the serpents
was about to kill an old {%ḍuṇḍubha%}, but this objected that he
had done him no harm (I, {@9@}). He told that he was formerly
a ṛṣi, named {%S.%}, who had been metamorphosed by the curse of
a brahman (I, {@10@}): I, {@10@}, 993.—§ 25 (do.): The {%ḍuṇḍubha%}
said: “I had a friend named {%Khagama%}; one day, when he
was engaged in the {%agnihotra%}, I made a mock-snake of blades
of grass in order to frighten him, and he went into a swoon;
then he cursed me saying that I should be turned into
a venomless serpent, until I had seen {%Ruru%}.” {%S%}. then
recovered his original form, and told {%Ruru%} that a brāhmaṇa
never should take life which was the duty of the kṣatriya.
