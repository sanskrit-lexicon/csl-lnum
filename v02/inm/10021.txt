{@Sṛñjaya@}<sup>3</sup>,¦ father of Suvarṇaṣṭhīvin. § 595 (Abhimanyu-
vadhap.): There was a king of the name {%Śaibya%} (C. {%°vya%}),
his son was {%S.%}; the ṛṣis {%Nārada%} and {%Parvata%} were the
friends of {%S%}. Seeing the daughter of {%S., Parvata%} asked if
she was Śrī, etc. (α). {%Nārada%} obtained her as his wife.
{%Parvata%} cursed {%Nārada%}, saying that he should not go to heaven
at his will, and {%Nārada%} (enumerating what constitutes a
marriage) cursed {%Parvata%}, saying that he should not go to
heaven without him. Meanwhile, king {%S.%}, desirous of
a son, prevailed upon the brahmans to ask {%Nārada%} on his
behalf, and, urged by {%Nārada%}, he prayed for a son
possessed of every accomplishment, and whose urine, etc.
should be of gold. This son was named {%Suvarṇaṣṭhīvin%}
(“gold-spitter”), and increased the wealth [of his father]
beyond all limits (description). Some robbers seized the
prince and slew him, and cut his body into fragments but
without finding any gold. The robbers then slew one another
and sank into an unimaginably awful hell. To {%Sṛñjaya%}, who
was afflicted with deep sorrow, the D.-ṛ. {%Nārada%} told the
{%Ṣoḍaśarājika%} (q.v.), i.e., the histories of sixteen kings who
had died (except the last, viz. {%Rāma Jāmadagnya%}), ending
each narrative with the words: “as he died who was
superior to thee and to thy son, thou shouldst not grieve for
the latter who performed no sacrifice and made no sacrificial
present.” (Each narrative then ends with the words: {%Śvai-%}
{%tyeti vyāharan%} [read {%vyāharat%}]; Nīl. takes Śvaitya (i.e. son of
Śvitya) as a name of {%S.%}, cf. also XII, 1052) (VII, {@55-70@}).
The grief of Sṛñjaya was dispelled and Nārada restored
his son to life: VII, {@55@}, 2138 ({%Śaibyasya…putraḥ%}),
