{@Mahodara@}<sup>4</sup>,¦ a muni. § 615 (Baladevatīrthayātrā): IX, {@39@},
2250.—§ 615{%k%} (do.): Formerly {%Rāma%} [Dāśarathi] lived in
the forest of {%Daṇḍaka%} from desire of slaying Rākṣasas. In
{%Janasthāna%} he cut off the head of a Rākṣasa, which coursing
at will fell upon the thigh of the brahman {%M%}. (who wandered
through the woods) and piercing it, it stuck to it and remained
there. {%M%}. in vain visited all the other tīrthas and spoke to
many ṛṣis; at last upon his having bathed in the tīrtha
{%Auśanasa%}, the head of the Rākṣasa fell off and was lost in the
waters. {%M.%}, with purified soul and all his sins washed away,
returned to his hermitage; the ṛṣis on account of this event
called the tīrtha by the name of {%Kapālamocana%}. The great
ṛṣi {%M.%}, repairing once more to that tīrtha, drank its water
and was crowned with great ascetic success: IX, {@39@}, 2257,
2266.
