niryāṇap.): It is heard that the brahmans, raising a standard
of kuśa-grass, encountered the kṣatriyas of the Haihaya clan
in battle; the vaiśyas and the śūdras joined the brahmans.
In the battles, however, the three castes repeatedly broke down,
while the kṣatriyas, though alone, vanquished their large
army because they obeyed the commands of only one person,
while the other three castes acted each according to his
individual understanding. The brahmans then appointed one
among themselves as their commander, and thus succeeded
in vanquishing the kṣatriyas: V, {@156@}, 5281.—§ 595
