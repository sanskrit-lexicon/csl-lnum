{@Vyuṣitāśva@},¦ an ancient king, descendant of Pūru. § 186{%b%}
(Pāṇḍu): There was a king named {%Vyuṣitāśva%}, of the race
of {%Pūru%}; once, when he sacrificed, the gods, with {%Indra%} and
{%Devarṣis%}, came there, and the gods and the {%Brahmarṣis%}
began themselves to perform a sacrifice ({%cakruḥ karma svayaṃ%});
having subdued the eastern, northern, western, and southern
princes, he performed a horse-sacrifice (a {%gāthā%} from the
{%Purāṇas%} is cited), etc. The wife of {%V%}. was {%Bhadrā%}
{%Kākṣīvatī%}, whom he loved so much that he was attacked by
phthisis and died sonless; {%Bhadrā%} could not bear separation
from him and cried out that he should show himself to her;
then his voice was heard saying that she, having bathed,
should lie down with him on her bed on the night of the
eighth or fourteenth day of the moon, then he would beget
offspring upon her. By the corpse of her husband she gave
birth to seven children: three {%Śālvas%} and four {%Madras%}: I,
{@121@}, 4686 ({%Pūror vaṃśavivardhanaḥ%}), 4688 ({%rājarṣeḥ%}), 4689,
4691, 4692, 4693.—§ 187 (do.): I, {@122@}, 4717.
