{@Śākadvīpa@},¦ a dvīpa named after the Śāka-tree. § 575
(Bhūmip.): VI, {@11@}α, 402.—§ 575{%b%} (do.): {%Ś%}. is of twice the
extent of {%Jambudvīpa%}, and the ocean also is of twice the
extent of that island. {%Ś%}. is surrounded on all sides by the
ocean. The kingdoms there are full of righteousness, and
the men never die; there is no famine; the people are
[Page183-a+ 63]
all full of forbearance and great energy. There are
seven mountains decked with jewels, etc., and many rivers.
The mountains are: (1) {%Meru%}, the abode of D., Ṛ., and G.;
(2) {%Malaya%}, to the east; there the clouds are generated, and
thence they disperse on all sides; (3) {%Jaladhāra%}, whence
{%Indra%} daily takes water, and from that we get showers of
rain; (4) {%Raivataka%}, over which the constellation {%Revati%} is
placed by {%Brahmán%} himself; (5) on the north of this is
{%Śyāma%}. Because the hue of these mountains is dark, the
people residing there are all dark in complexion; (6) {%Durga-%}
{%śaila%}; (7) {%Keśarin%} (B. {%Kesara%}). The measure of each of these
mountains is double that of the one mentioned immediately
before. There are seven {%Varṣas%} (β,) one for each mountain.
In the midst is a large tree called {%Śāka%}, in height and breadth
equal to the {%Jambu%}-tree in {%Jambudvīpa%}, and it is always adored
by the people. There are many delightful provinces where
{%Śiva%} is worshipped, and thither repair D., Si., and Cā. The
people are virtuous, and all the four orders are devoted to their
respective occupations. There is no instance of theft. They
are free from decrepitude and death, and gifted with long life.
The rivers (γ) are full of sacred water whence {%Indra%} draws
water to shower it as rain. {%Gaṅgā%} herself is among them. They
are all sin-cleansing. There are four sacred provinces (δ).
There is no king and no punishment, and no person that
deserves to be punished: VI, {@11@}, 408, 411, 413, 441.—
§ 623 (Rājadh.): XII, {@14@}α, 406 (east of Meru, swayed
by Yudhiṣṭhira), 407.
