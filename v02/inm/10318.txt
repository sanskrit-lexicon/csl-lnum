[{@Sundopasundapākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode relating
to Sunda and Upasunda”). § 246 (Rājyalābhap.). {%Nārada%}
related: In days of yore the {%Daitya Nikumbha%} of the race of
{%Hiraṇyakaśipu%} had two sons, {%Sunda%} and {%Upasunda%}, who always
shared with each other happiness as well as woe, and never
went anywhere unless together. Desirous of subjugating
the three worlds, they practised terrible penances on the
mountain {%Vindhya%}, which, by the power of their austerities at
last began to emit vapour. In vain the gods repeatedly
tempted them by means of every precious possession and
beautiful girls, and by illusion, causing their sisters, mothers,
wives, etc., to appear pursued by a {%rākṣasa%} and imploring their
help. When {%Brahmán%} granted them a boon, they asked to
become immortal, which he refused, granting them instead
that they should not need to be afraid of anything except
each other, etc. They now desisted from their asceticism
and returned to their abode, where they lived happy, causing
even the moon to rise over their city every night, even out of
season (I, {@209@}). They set out to conquer the three worlds
in the night under the constellation of {%Maghāḥ%}, with a large
{%Daitya%} force cased in mail, etc. The gods sought refuge in
{%Brahmaloka%}, and the {%Daityas%} subjugated {%Indraloka%}, and van-
quished the tribes of the {%Yakṣas%} and {%Rakṣases%}, and the
{%Khecaras%}, and the {%Nāgas%} in the earth, and the tribes of the
{%Mlecchas%} dwelling in the ocean. In order to extinguish the
sacrifices that strengthened the gods, they slew those that
were performing sacrifices and the assistant {%brahmans%}, etc.
Then they took up their abode in {%Kurukṣetra%} (I, {@210@}).
The {%Devarṣis%} and {%Siddhas%} and {%ṛṣis%} were affected with great
grief, and went to the abode of {%Pitāmaha%}, seated with the
gods, the {%Siddhas%}, and the {%Brahmarṣis, Mahādeva, Agni%},
{%Vāyu%}, the sun and moon, {%Śakra%}, the {%Pārameṣṭhya ṛṣis%}, the
{%Vaikhānasas%}, the {%Vālakhilyas%}, the {%Vānaprasthas%}, the {%Marīcipas%},
the {%Ajas%}, the {%Avimūḍhas%}, etc. {%Brahmán%} sent {%Tilottamā (b%})
to them (I, {@211@}). She came to {%Sunda%} and {%Upasunda%} as they
were sporting in the {%Vindhya%} mountains, and from jealousy
they struck each other to death with their maces. And
{%Pitāmaha%} then came there with the gods and the great {%ṛṣis%},
and granted to {%Tilottamā%} that she should roam in the region
of the {%Ādityas%}. Then, bestowing the three worlds on {%Indra%}
as before, he returned to his own region.
