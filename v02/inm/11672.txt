kingdom of the {%Cedis%}. Some time after he dwelled in a
hermitage practising austerities, from which the gods,
headed by {%Indra%}, prevailed upon him to refrain. {%Indra%}
gave him a crystal {%vimāna%} (chariot) capable of carrying him
through the air like a god, and a triumphal ({%vaijayantī%})
garland named {%Indramālā%}, and a bamboo pole to protect the
peaceful. After a year the king planted this pole in the
ground in order to worship {%Indra%} (from that time all
kings plant a bamboo pole, and the next day they cover it
with golden clothes, etc.). {%Indra%} came there in the form of
a swan to accept the worship, and blessed the men and kings
who would observe this festivity: I, {@63@}, 2335 ({%Paurava-%}

and from love of this river the mountain Kolāhala once barred
its course. {%V%}. then kicked the mountain with his foot, and
