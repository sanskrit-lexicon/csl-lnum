{@Śukābhipatana(ṃ)@}¦ (“the flying about” of Śuka): XII,
{@332—334@} (12557—12649) (continued from {%Śuka-Nārada-%}
{%saṃvāda%}, q.v.). § 716: Hearing the words of {%Nārada%},
{%Śuka%} understood that great misery follows the acquisition
of children and wives, and that one has to undergo great
labour in order to acquire science and Vedic lore. He
resolved to attain to the highest end, that is fraught with
the greatest felicity, and whence there is no return into the
ocean of births; “that cannot be attained without {%yoga%};
I shall therefore have recourse to {%yoga%}, and throwing off this
body I shall become transformed into wind and enter the Sun;
for he does not wane like the Moon (Soma) with the gods; when
after death one enters the moon he falls to earth and thence
ascends to heaven; with the great Ṛṣis I shall enter the
energy of the Sun; I declare before all the creatures…
earth,…D., Dā., G., Pś., U., Rā., and R., that I shall
enter all creatures in the world.” Obtaining {%Nārada's%} per-
mission, {%Śuka%} went to {%Vyāsa%}, who asked him to stay there for
the day that he might behold him for some time. But {%Śuka%}, only
intent on emancipation, immediately left him and proceeded
to {%Kailāsa%}, which was inhabited by crowds of ascetics (XII,
{@332@}). Having reached the summit of {%Kailāsa, Śuka%} set
himself to practise {%yoga%} (description). Having then obtained
the permission of {%Nārada%}, he soared into the skies and identified
himself with the element of wind; Aps. ({%Pañcacūḍā%}, etc.),
G., R., etc., wondered. {%Śuka%} proceeded in silence, his face
turned towards the east, regarding the sun; then to the
{%Malaya%} mountain; {%Urvaśī%} and {%Pūrvacitti%}, who always dwell
on {%Malaya%}, wondered. {%Śuka%} asked the gods, etc., to return
his father an answer from him, if he should repeatedly call
on him (XII, {@333@}). {%Śuka%} freed himself of the four kinds of
faults, the eight kinds of {%tamas%}, the five kinds of {%rajas%}, the
attribute of {%sattva%}, and then dwelt in {%Bráhman%}. Meteors began
to shoot, etc.; {%Indra%} poured showers of rain; {%Himavat%} and {%Meru%}
(the one yellow, made of gold; the other white, made of
silver), each 100 yojanas in height and breadth, were in close
contact with each other. Journeying towards the north, {%Śuka%}
clashed against them, and they were immediately broken in two.
He was adored by G., R., Y., Rā., and {%Vidyādharas%}. He saw
from a high region the celestial stream {%Mandākinī%} running
below, with many Aps. Beholding {%Śuka%}, who was bodyless,
those unclad aërial beings felt no shame. {%Vyāsa%} followed
behind him on the same aërial path, by means of high {%Yoga%}.
{%Śuka%}, above the region of the wind, identified himself with
{%Bráhman%}. Ṛ. represented to {%Vyāsa%} the achievements of his
son. He indulged in lamentations; {%Śuka%}, who had entered
the universe, had become the soul of everything, and had
acquired omnipresence, answered by uttering {%bho%} in the form
of an echo, and the entire universe echoed the answer of {%Śuka%}
from that time; mountain caves and mountain sides still
[Page219-a+ 63]
echo sounds uttered there. Having cast off all the attributes
of sound, etc., and showing his {%yoga%} prowess in the manner
of his disappearance, {%Śuka%} in this way attained to the
highest station. {%Vyāsa%} sat down and began to think of his
son with grief; the Aps. who were sporting on the banks of
the celestial stream {%Mandākinī%} saw him seated there, and
all became agitated with shame. {%Śiva%}, with D., G., and
great Ṛ., came and comforted {%Vyāsa%}, who by the favour of {%Śiva%}
thenceforward always beheld a shadow of his son by his side.
“This {%Nārada%} and {%Vyāsa%} repeatedly told me in days of yore”
(XII, {@334@}). [PCR. rightly remarks that, according to this
story, {%Śuka%} who recited the Bhāgavata to Parikṣit, the
grandson of Yudhiṣṭhira, could not possibly be the {%Śuka%}
who was {%Vyāsa's%} son.]
