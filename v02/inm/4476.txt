the utterance of words (so PCR., who follows the various
reading cited by Nīl., {%“vācā yatra bhavan,”%} instead of {%“vātā-%}
{%baddhā bhavan”%}) caused the gathering of clouds and stones
by thousands. There the recitation of the sacred scriptures
was heard, but nobody was seen; in the evening and the
morning there was seen fire, and biting flies would interrupt
the austerities. Lomaśa explained that formerly on this
{%Ṛṣabhakūṭa%} (i.e. Hemakūṭa) dwelt a great and resentful ṛṣi,
who was many hundred years old, and was named Ṛshabha.
When practising austerities he had been spoken to by others,
and in wrath he ordered the mountain to throw stones on him
who should utter any word there, and forbade the wind to
make any noise. Therefore, as soon as a man utters any word
here he is forbidden by a roaring cloud. Formerly, when
the gods came to the {%Nandā%}, many men came to see them, but
the gods with Indra at their head did not like to be seen,
and therefore they rendered the spot inaccessible by raising
obstructions in the form of mountains, and from that day
onwards men could not see that hill, far less ascend it.
Lomaśa further said: “Here all the gods performed the best
sacrifices, and the marks thereof may be seen to this day, the
grass resembling {%kuśa%} grass, and many trees resembling {%yūpas%};
the gods and ṛṣis dwell there to this day, and it is their fire
which is seen in the evening and the morning. By bathing
