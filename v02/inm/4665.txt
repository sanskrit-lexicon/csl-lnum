[{@Indrota-Pārīkṣitīya(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the narrative of Indrota
and Janamejaya Pārikṣit”). § 652{%b%} (Āpaddh.): {%Bhīṣma%}
said: There <is>was, in days of yore</is>, a king {%Pārikṣit%}
(! so B.; C. {%°rī°%}) {%Janamejaya%}; from want of judgment he
became guilty of killing a brahman; then all the brahmans,
with his priests, abandoned him; burning day and night with
regret, the king retired into the woods; deserted by his
subjects also, and consumed by repentance, he underwent the
most rigid austerities. In order to purify himself of the sin of
brahmanicide he interrogated many brahmans, and wandered
from country to country over the whole earth. One day he
met {%Indrota Śaunaka%}, who rebuked him for his brahmanicide
and reminded him of the messengers of {%Yama%} in the abode of
{%Yama%} (XII, {@150@}). {%Janamejaya%} meekly listened to the reproof,
saying that he was much afraid of {%Yama%}; he knew that,
according to the Vedas, wretches like himself had forfeited all
claim to the respect of the world, and had after death to
dwell in hell like {%Pulindas%} and {%Śabaras%} (so C. and B.; PCR.
{%Khasas%}), and he sought instruction from {%Indrota%}, who told him
to repent and, knowing the Vedas, etc., act in such a way that
the brahmans might not be angry with him; {%Śaunaka%} said
that his kinsmen and friends would call him sinful because he
instructed {%Janamejaya. Janamejaya%} swore never again to
injure the brahmans (XII, {@151@}). {%Indrota%} discoursed to the
repentant king on the means of cleansing himself, quoting
a verse sung by {%Yayāti%} about the sacredness of {%Kurukṣetra%},
etc. (α), and recommending him to go to {%Mahāsaras%}, etc. (β),
quoting also a saying of {%Manu%} and a verse of {%Satyavat%}.
{%Mahāsaras%}, etc. (γ), are so sacred that one guilty of fœticide
becomes cleansed at even 100 yojanas from them. {%Manu%} has
said that by diving in water after thrice reciting the {%Agha-%}
{%marṣaṇa [mantras]%} (v. the note of PCR., p. 498), one reaps
the fruits of the final bath in a horse-sacrifice. The gods and
{%Asuras%} in days of yore were instructed by M.-ṛ. {%Bṛhaspati%}, the
preceptor of the gods, how one should cleanse himself from
sin. {%Indrota%} then assisted {%Janamejaya%}, cleansed of his sins, in
the horse-sacrifice (XII, {@152@}).
