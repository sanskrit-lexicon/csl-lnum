{@Māndhātṛ@}<sup>1</sup>,¦ an ancient king, son of Yuvanāśva. § 11

{%Yauvanāśva%} vanquished the gods, the Asuras, and men; the
{%Aśvins%} took him out from his father's womb by a surgical
operation, as {%Yuvanāśva%}, when a-hunting, had drunk the
sacrificial butter from a sacrifice and become quick with child.
Then {%Indra%} let him suck milk from his fingers (whence the
name of {%M%}.); in twelve days he became 12 cubits in
stature. He conquered the whole earth and vanquished
the kings {%Janamejaya%}, etc. (α), in a single day; all the lands
lying between the mountain where the sun rises and the
mountain where he sets are known to this day as the
dominions of {%M%}. Having performed a hundred horse-sacrifices
and a hundred {%rājasūyas%}, he gave to the brahmans some {%rohita%}
fishes of gold, 10 {%yojanas%} in length and 1 {%yojana%} in breadth.
The gods, the Asuras, men, the Yakṣas, the Gandharvas,
the Uragas, the birds, the brahmans, and the {%ṛṣis%} came to
his sacrifices. At last he repaired to the regions of the
righteous (C. {%puṇyakṛtāl lokān%}; B. {%°āṃ lo°%}) (VII, {@62@}): VII,
