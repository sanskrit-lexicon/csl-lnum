{@Cākṣuṣā@},¦ a Gandharvic science given to Arjuna by
Citraratha. § 221 (Caitrarathap.): I, {@170@}, 6478.—§ 221{%b%}
(Caitrarathap.): {%C%}. had been communicated by {%Manu%} to {%Soma%},
by {%Soma%} to {%Viśvāvasu%}, and by {%Viśvāvasu%} to {%Citraratha%} after
ascetic penances, and when communicated by the preceptor to
a man without energy, it becomes fruitless. By means of it
one may see whatever one wishes. One can acquire it only
by standing on one leg for six months; but {%Arjuna%} obtained it
without any rigid vow. This knowledge makes the {%Gandharvas%}
superior to men and equal to the gods.
