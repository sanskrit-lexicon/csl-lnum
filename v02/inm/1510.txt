[{@Bhīṣmavadhaparvan@}]¦ (“the section relating to the
slaying of Bhīṣma,” the 70th of the minor parvans of
Mhbhr.; cf. Bhīṣmavadha). § 577: Beholding {%Arjuna%}
again taking up the {%Gāṇḍīva%}, the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Somakas%}
were filled with joy and blew their conches, etc. D., G., P.,
Si., Cā., and Ṛ. came with {%Indra%} in order to behold the fight.
Putting off his coat of mail, etc., {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, followed by
his brothers (α) (who did not know his intentions) and {%Kṛṣṇa%},
proceeded on foot, with joined hands, to {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (β), one
after another, and asked their permission to fight. He also
inquired about the means of vanquishing {%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa%},
and as they said that they were invincible he asked them to
indicate the means of killing them. They gave the permission,
said they would pray for his victory, though they were bound
by the wealth of the {%Kurus%} to fight for them. {%Bhīṣma%} said
that his time of death had not yet come, he must come to see
him once more. {%Droṇa%} said that if he did not give himself
up to death and drop his weapons nobody would be able to
slay him; he would drop his arms if he heard something very
disagreeable from someone whose speech was trustworthy.
{%Kṛpa%} said he was incapable of being slain. {%Śalya%} renewed
his promise to weaken the energy of {%Karṇa%}. When the
{%Kauravas%} saw {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, they contemned him, believing
that he had come in terror. {%Kṛṣṇa%} endeavoured to bring
{%Karṇa%} over to the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, as long as {%Bhīṣma%} was not slain,
but in vain. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} exclaimed, “He who chooses us,
him we will choose for our ally”; {%Yuyutsu%} went over to the
{%Pāṇḍavas%}, and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} said that the propagation of
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} lineage and his śrāddha oblations rested
on him. The {%Mlecchas%} and {%Aryans%} wept for joy at the
behaviour of the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, and blew their conches, etc.
(VI, {@43@}).—§ 578: THE FIRST DAY'S ENCOUNTER: {%Duḥśāsana%}
advanced with his troops with {%Bhīṣma%} at their head,
and the {%Pāṇḍavas%} headed by {%Bhīmasena%}, who roared fright-
fully. {%Duryodhana%}, etc. (α), attacked {%Bhīmasena%}. The
{%Draupadeyas%}, etc. (β), rushed against the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%}.
The disciples of {%Droṇa%} always hit the mark (VI, {@44@}).
(1) {%Bhīṣma%} attacked {%Arjuna%}; (2) {%Sātyaki%} attacked {%Kṛta—%}
{%varman%}; (3) {%Abhimanyu%} fought with {%Bṛhadbala%}; (4) {%Bhīma-%}
{%sena%} struggled with {%Duryodhana%}; (5) {%Duḥśāsana%} fought
with {%Nakula%}; (6) {%Durmukha%} fought with {%Sahadeva%}; (7)
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} fought with the {%Madra%} king ({%Śalya%}); (8)
[Page140-b+ 63]
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} attacked {%Droṇa%}; (9) {%Śaṅkha%} encountered
{%Somadatta's%} son; (10) {%Dhṛṣṭaketu%} (the king of the {%Cedis%})
encountered {%Bāhlīka%}, they looked like the planets {%Aṅgāraka%}
(Mars) and {%Budha%} (Mercury); (11) {%Ghaṭotkaca%} encountered
{%Alambuṣa%}; (12) {%Śikhaṇḍin%} encountered {%Aśvatthāman%}; (13)
{%Virāṭa%} attacked {%Bhagadatta%}; (14) {%Kṛpa%} attacked the {%Kaikeya%}
king {%Bṛhatkṣattra%}; (15) {%Drupada%} attacked the {%Sindhu%} king
{%Jayadratha%}, they resembled the planets {%Śukra%} (Venus) and
{%Aṅgāraka%} (Mars); (16) {%Vikarṇa%} (son of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%})
attacked {%Sutasoma%}; (17) {%Cekitāna%}, who sided with the
{%Pāṇḍavas%}, attacked {%Suśarman%}; (18) {%Śakuni%} attacked {%Prati-%}
{%vindhya%}; (19) {%Śrutakarman%} (the son of {%Sahadeva%}) attacked
the {%Kāmboja%} king {%Sudakṣiṇa%}, and stood like the {%Maināka%}
mountain; (20) {%Irāvat%} (son of {%Arjuna%}) attacked {%Śrutāyus%};
(21) the two princes of {%Avanti, Vinda%} and {%Anuvinda%}, en-
countered {%Kuntibhoja%} with his son; (22) the {%Kekaya-%}brothers
encountered the five {%Gāndhāra-%}princes; (23) {%Vīrabāhu%} (son
of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}) encountered {%Uttara%} (the son of {%Virāṭa%});
(24) The {%Cedi%} king attacked {%Ulūka%}. Thousands of single
combats took place. D.-ṛ., Si., and Cā. beheld the battle,
which resembled the combat of D. and As. (VI, {@45@}). The
{%Pāṇḍavas%} and the {%Kurus%} fought as if they were possessed by
demons. The divisions of the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, approaching {%Bhīṣma%}
({%b%}), began to yield (VI, {@46@}). (25) After the greater part of the
forenoon had worn out, {%Durmukha%}, etc. (γ), began to protect
{%Bhīṣma%}, who rushed upon the {%Cedis%}, etc. (δ). (26) Then
{%Abhimanyu (c%}) attacked {%Bhīṣma, Kṛtavarman, Śalya%},
{%Durmukha%} (cutting off the head of his charioteer), and
{%Kṛpa%} (cutting in two his bow); he was regarded as equal
to {%Arjuna%}, and his bow sent forth a twang like that of the
{%Gāṇḍīva%}; he stood firm like the {%Maināka%} mountain. When
{%Bhīṣma's%} standard fell down, {%Bhīma%} shouted. {%Bhīṣma%} used
celestial weapons. (27) In order to protect {%Abhimanyu%},
{%Virāṭa%}, etc. (ε), attacked {%Bhīṣma%}, who wounded {%Dhṛṣṭa-%}
{%dyumna%} and {%Sātyaki%}, and they cut off the standard of {%Bhīma-%}
{%sena (d%}), who wounded {%Bhīṣma%} and {%Kṛpa%} and {%Kṛtavarman%}.
(28) Mounted on an elephant, {%Uttara%} (the son of {%Virāṭa%})
attacked the {%Madra%} king {%Śalya%}, whose steeds were killed
by the elephant; {%Śalya%}, with a dart, deprived {%Uttara%} of his
senses, and mounted the chariot of {%Kṛtavarman%}. (29) Seeing
his brother {%Uttara%} slain and {%Śalya%} staying with {%Kṛtavarman%},
{%Śveta%} (the son of {%Virāṭa%}) attacked {%Śalya%}. (30) The {%Kosala%}
king {%Bṛhadbala%}, etc. (ζ), attacked {%Śveta%} in order to protect
{%Śalya; Śveta%} wounded {%Rukmaratha%}, who was borne away
by his charioteer. (31) Then {%Duryodhana%}, with {%Bhīṣma%},
etc., attacked {%Śveta%} and rescued {%Śalya; Bhīṣma%} shot
at {%Abhimanyu%}, etc. (η) (VI, {@47@}). The {%Pāṇḍavas%}, with
{%Śikhaṇḍin%}, desired to rescue the generalissimo {%Śveta%} and
attacked {%Bhīṣma%}. The {%Kurus%} retreated from fear, and
abandoned {%Bhīṣma%}. (32) {%Duryodhana%} averted {%Śveta%} from
{%Bhīṣma%}, and was routed; (33) {%Śveta%} once more attacked
{%Bhīṣma%}, whose standard he cut down; (34) then {%Bāhlīka%},
etc. (θ), attacked {%Śveta%} in order to protect {%Bhīṣma%}, whose
chariot {%Śveta%} reduced to ashes, with standard, etc.; (35)
{%Śalya%}, etc., rushed to {%Bhīṣma's%} rescue; a voice in the skies
admonished {%Bhīṣma%} to hasten the death of {%Śveta%}. (36)
{%Sātyaki%}, etc. (κ), rushed to the rescue of {%Śveta. Bhīṣma%},
etc. (λ), checked them. With a shaft endued with the
force of the {%Brāhma%} weapon, seen by D., G., P., U., and
Rā., {%Bhīṣma%} shot {%Śveta%} to death. The {%Pāṇḍavas%} (with
{%Śikhaṇḍin%}) lamented; the {%Kurus%} rejoiced; {%Duḥśāsana%} danced
for joy. {%Arjuna%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} withdrew the troops, the same
did the {%Kurus%} (VI, {@48@}). (37) When {%Śveta%} had been slain,
[Page141-a+ 63]
{%Virāṭa's%} son {%Śaṅkha%}, on beholding {%Śalya%} standing with
{%Kṛtavarman%}, attacked {%Śalya%}; (38) {%Bhīṣma%} attacked {%Śaṅkha%};
(39) {%Arjuna%} placed himself in front of {%Śaṅkha%} and attacked
{%Bhīṣma%}; (40) {%Śalya%}, mace in hand, slew the steeds of
{%Śaṅkha%}, who mounted {%Arjuna's%} chariot. (41) {%Bhīṣma%} with
his arrows slaughtered the {%Pāñcāla%} hosts, etc. (μ), abandoned
{%Arjuna%}, and attacked {%Drupada%}. The {%Pāṇḍavas%} were routed,
the sun set, and the {%Pāṇḍavas%} withdrew their forces (VI, {@49@}).
Seeing {%Bhīṣma's%} (and {%Droṇa's%}) prowess, {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} com-
plained before {%Kṛṣṇa%}, and spoke of retiring into the woods.
{%Bhīma%} alone, he said, fought in accordance with {%kṣattriya%}
duties; {%Arjuna%} was indifferent. {%Kṛṣṇa%} consoled him,
saying that he had got {%Sātyaki%}, etc. (ν), and that {%Śikhaṇḍin%}
was certainly the slayer of {%Bhīṣma. Yudhiṣṭhira%} then
addressed {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, saying that he himself and {%Bhīma%},
etc. (ξ), would follow him. {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} said that he had
been appointed by {%Śambhu%} to slay {%Droṇa%} and to fight against
{%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (ο). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} recommended the array
called {%Krauñcāruṇa%}, which {%Bṛhaspati%} had explained to {%Indra%}
in days of old, when the gods and the {%Asuras%} fought, but
which had never been seen before. When morning dawned,
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} placed {%Arjuna%} ({%e%}) in the van of the army, and
{%Drupada%} became the head [of the array], etc. (π) (VI, {@50@}).
Seeing the {%Krauñca%} of the {%Pāṇḍavas, Duryodhana%}, approaching
{%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (ρ), gladdened them all, saying that their army,
which was protected by {%Bhīṣma%}, was immeasurable, while
that of the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, protected by {%Bhīma%}, was measurable.
The {%Saṃsthānas%}, etc. (σ), should protect {%Bhīṣma. Bhīṣma%},
{%Droṇa%}, and the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%} formed a mighty array. {%Bhīṣma%}
was followed by {%Droṇa%} with the {%Kuntalas%}, etc. (τ). {%Śakuni%}
protected {%Droṇa%}. Followed by his brothers and the {%Aśvātakas%},
etc. (υ), {%Duryodhana%} advanced against the {%Pāṇḍava%} host.
{%Bhūriśravas%}, etc. (ϕ), protected the left flank; {%Somadatta%}, etc.
(χ), the right; {%Aśvatthāman%}, etc. (ψ), were in the rear;
behind them {%Ketumat%}, etc. (ω). {%Bhīṣma%} and the others
blew their conches, etc. {%Kṛṣṇa%}, etc. (αα), blew their
conches ({%Kṛṣṇa%} blew {%Pāñcajanya%}, etc.). The {%Kurus%} and
{%Pāṇḍavas%} marched against each other in order to renew
the battle (VI, {@51@}).—§ 579: SECOND DAY: {%Duryodhana%}
began the battle. (1) {%Bhīṣma%} shot at {%Abhimanyu%}, etc. (α);
{%Arjuna%} told {%Kṛṣṇa%} to take his chariot before {%Bhīṣma%};
“protected by {%Bhīṣma, Droṇa%}, etc. (β), will slaughter
the {%Pāñcālas%}.” Only {%Bhīṣma, Droṇa%}, and {%Karṇa%} could
encounter {%Arjuna. Bhīṣma%} was protected by {%Saindhava%}
(i.e. Jayadratha), etc. (γ). {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (δ), struck {%Arjuna%},
who struck {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (ε). {%Sātyaki%}, etc. (ζ), surrounded
{%Arjuna%}. (2) The {%Pāñcāla%} prince and the {%Somakas%} attacked
{%Droṇa%}. (3) {%Bhīṣma%} fought with {%Arjuna%}, at the request
of {%Duryodhana%}, who complained of the absence of {%Karṇa%};
{%Aśvatthāman%}, etc. (η), stood for battle; {%Bhīṣma%} wounded
{%Kṛṣṇa%}; D., G., Cā., and great Ṛ. said they would be
invincible by all the worlds with D., As., and G. (4) See
2 (VI, {@52@}): Continuation of the combat between {%Droṇa%}
and {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}. (5) {%Bhīma%} attacked {%Droṇa%} in order
to aid {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, whom he caused to be taken up on
another chariot. (6) Urged by {%Duryodhana%}, the {%Kaliṅga%} king
rushed against {%Bhīma%} in order to protect {%Droṇa%}. (7) {%Droṇa%}
abandoned {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} and encountered {%Virāṭa%} and {%Dru-%}
{%pada%}. (8) {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} proceeded to support {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}.
(9) See 6 (VI, {@53@}): {%Bhīmasena%} was supported by the {%Cedis%};
the {%Kaliṅga%} king by {%Ketumat%} (son of the {%Niṣāda%} king; {%rāja-%}
{%putraḥ%}, v. 2354) and {%Śrutāyus%}. The {%Cedis%}, etc. (θ), attacked
the {%Niṣādas%}. (10) The {%Cedis%} left {%Bhīmasena%} and turned
[Page141-b+ 63]
back; the {%Kaliṅga%} king and his son {%Śakradeva%} fought with
{%Bhīma%}, who slew {%Śakradeva%} with his mace. (11) {%Bhīma%}
attacked {%Bhānumat%} (the prince of the {%Kaliṅgas%}), and slew him
with his sword, dividing him in the middle, and made a great
slaughter of men and elephants. (12) Beholding {%Śrutāyus%}
(the ruler of the {%Kaliṅgas%}) at the head of the {%Kaliṅga%} troops,
{%Bhīmasena%} attacked him, was wounded, and taken into his
chariot by the charioteer {%Aśoka%}; once more he fought with
{%Śrutāyus%}, and slew him, and {%Satyadeva%}, and {%Satya%}, and {%Ketumat%},
and routed the {%Kaliṅgas%}. (13) When, however, the {%Kaliṅgas%}
were rallied again, {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, with {%Śikhaṇḍin, Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%}, etc., protected one of the wings of {%Bhīmasena%}; there
was nobody on earth, save {%Bhīma%} and {%Sātyaki%}, who was
dearer to {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} than his very life; they beheld
{%Sātyaki%} at a distance; and that [grand]son of {%Śini%} took
up the wing of both {%Bhīma%} and {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Bhīma%}
caused a bloody river to flow there. (14) {%Bhīṣma%} heard
the cries, attacked {%Bhīma%}, and was attacked by {%Sātyaki%},
etc. (ι). {%Bhīṣma%} jumped from his chariot, mace in hand,
and was taken by {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} on his chariot. {%Sātyaki%}
slew the charioteer of {%Bhīṣma%}, who was then carried away
from the field of battle by his steeds. The {%Kaliṅgas%} were
totally routed by {%Bhīma%}, who was praised by the {%Pāñcālas%} and
{%Matsyas%}, himself embraced {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, and was con-
gratulated by {%Sātyaki%}, who returned to his own chariot and
began to slay the {%Kurus%} (VI, {@54@}). (15) When the forenoon
of that day had passed away, {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} engaged in battle
with {%Aśvatthāman%}, etc. (κ); he slew the steeds of {%Aśvatthāman%},
who got up on {%Śalya's%} car. (16) {%Abhimanyu%} quickly came
up and wounded {%Śalya%}, etc. (λ), but was, in his turn, wounded
by {%Aśvatthāman%}, etc. (μ). (17) {%Lakṣmaṇa%} (the son of {%Duryo-%}
{%dhana%}) attacked {%Abhimanyu%}. (18) {%Duryodhana%} attacked {%Abhi-%}
{%manyu%} in order to aid {%Lakṣmaṇa%}. (19) {%Arjuna%} engaged in
battle with the {%Kurus%}, headed by {%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa%}; dust and
{%Abhimanyu's%} arrows produced complete darkness. The {%Kurus%}
were routed. {%Arjuna%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} blew their conches. {%Bhīṣma%}
suggested to {%Droṇa%} that they should withdraw the troops,
and as the sun set both armies were withdrawn (VI, {@55@}).—
§ 580: THIRD DAY; (1) Next morning {%Bhīṣma%} formed a
{%Garuḍa%} array; at its beak was {%Bhīṣma%} himself; its eyes were
formed by {%Droṇa%} and {%Kṛtavarman; Aśvatthāman%}, etc. (α), were
at its head; {%Bhūriśravas%}, etc. (β), were placed in its neck;
at its back was {%Duryodhana%} and his followers; {%Vinda%}, etc.
(γ), formed its tail; the {%Magadhas%}, etc. (δ), formed the right
wing; the {%Kārūṣas%}, etc. (ε), were stationed in the left wing.
(2) {%Arjuna%} and {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} formed an array in the
shape of a half-moon, with {%Bhīmasena%} in the right horn, etc.
(ζ); next to {%Nīla Dhṛṣṭaketu%}, etc. (η); in the middle was
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, etc. (θ); on the left horn was he who had
{%Kṛṣṇa%} for his protector. Then the battle commenced
(VI, {@56@}). (3) {%Arjuna%} fought with the {%Kauravas%}, who could
not be broken, as they were protected by {%Droṇa%}; and the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} could not be broken, as they were protected by
{%Arjuna%} and {%Bhīma%}. At last {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (ι), broke the ranks
of the {%Pāṇḍavas. Bhīmasena%}, etc. (κ), attacked the {%Kauravas%}
and fought with {%Duryodhana, Bhīṣma%}, and {%Droṇa; Abhimanyu%}
and {%Sātyaki%} attacked {%Śakuni%} (VI, {@57@}). D., Dā., G., Pś., U.,
and Rā. eulogized {%Arjuna%}. (4) The {%Gāndhāras%}, with {%Śakuni%},
fought with {%Sātyaki%} (the {%Vṛṣṇi%} hero) and {%Abhimanyu%}, and
destroyed the chariot of {%Sātyaki%}, who mounted {%Abhimanyu's%}
chariot. (5) {%Droṇa%} and {%Bhīṣma%} attacked {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, and
were attacked by him and the sons of {%Mādrī%}. (6) {%Bhīmasena%}
and {%Ghaṭotkaca%} fought with {%Duryodhana%}, who was brought
[Page142-a+ 63]
away by his charioteer, and his troops fled, pursued by
{%Bhīma%}. (7) {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} slew {%Droṇa's%}
and {%Bhīṣma's%} army, which fled and could not be checked by
by {%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa%}. (8) {%Abhimanyu%} and {%Śaineya%} began
to slaughter the army of {%Śakuni%}. (9) {%Arjuna%} routed the
{%Kaurava%} army, and its flight could not be checked by
{%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa%}, but was checked by {%Duryodhana%}, who
blamed {%Bhīṣma%}, saying that he did not sincerely fight with
the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, otherwise his troops could not have been
routed while {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (λ), were alive; had he known this
unwillingness of {%Bhīṣma%} to fight, he would have consulted
{%Karṇa. Bhīṣma%} said that the {%Pāṇḍavas%} were incapable of
being vanquished by the very gods, including {%Indra%}, but he
alone would check them to-day (VI, {@58@}). (10) After the
forenoon of that day had passed away, {%Bhīṣma%} attacked the
{%Pāṇḍavas%}, and a dreadful battle ensued, in which the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
were routed. {%Kṛṣṇa%} told {%Arjuna%} to strike {%Bhīṣma%}, reminding
him of his vow to slay all the warriors of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} son,
headed by {%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa%}. At the request of {%Arjuna%},
{%Kṛṣṇa%} drove the steeds to where {%Bhīṣma%} was, and the army
of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} rallied for battle. {%Arjuna%} and {%Bhīṣma%}
fought; {%Kṛṣṇa%} displayed great skill in driving the horses;
he and {%Arjuna%} were both wounded by {%Bhīṣma%}, and the
{%Pāṇḍava%} army was routed; {%Bhīṣma%} ordered {%Droṇa%}, etc. (μ), to
attack {%Arjuna%}. (11) The grandson of {%Śini%} came to {%Arjuna's%}
rescue; {%Kṛṣṇa%} applauded him, and, saying that he would slay
{%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa%}, etc., he jumped down from the chariot with
his discus {%Sudarśana%} in his hand, and rushed towards {%Bhīṣma%}
(who welcomed him), but was held back by {%Arjuna%}, who said
that he would himself slay the {%Kurus%}; he was then prevailed
upon to mount the chariot once more, where he blew the
{%Pāñcajanya%}, while arrows were shot from the {%Gāṇḍīva%} in all
directions. (12) Then {%Duryodhana%}, etc. (ν), attacked {%Arjuna%},
who invoked the {%Māhendra%} weapon and checked the {%Kaurava%}
host. (13) {%Virāṭa, Drupada%}, etc., approached. {%Arjuna%} caused
a river of blood to flow there with {%Rākṣasas%} on its banks.
Elated with victory, the {%Cedis%}, etc. (ξ), set up a loud shout.
The {%Kurus%}, including {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (ο), got afraid of the {%Indra-%}
weapon, and withdrew their forces at sunset. The same did
{%Arjuna%}. Among the {%Kurus%} there was a great uproar: “The
{%Sauvīras%}, etc. (π), have all been slain by {%Arjuna%}, and he has
vanquished {%Śrutāyus%}, etc. (ρ)” (VI, {@59@}).—§ 581: THE
FOURTH DAY: (1) When the night had passed away, {%Bhīṣma%}
at the head of the army proceeded against the foe, surrounded
by {%Droṇa%}, etc. (α). The array of the {%Pāṇḍavas%} was like that
of the day before. {%Bhīṣma (b%}) attacked {%Arjuna%}, and so
did {%Droṇa%}, etc. (β); {%Abhimanyu%} rushed out of the ranks
and proceeded against all the foes, but {%Bhīṣma%} avoided
{%Abhimanyu%} and fought against {%Arjuna%} himself (VI, {@60@}).
(2) {%Aśvatthāman%}, etc. (γ), fought with {%Abhimanyu%}. (3) Urged
by {%Duryodhana%}, the {%Trigartas%}, etc. (δ), attacked {%Arjuna%}
and {%Abhimanyu%}. (4) Proceeding towards {%Arjuna, Dhṛṣṭa-%}
{%dyumna%} attacked the {%Madras%}, etc. (ε), and slew {%Saṃyamani's%}
son (VI, {@61@}). {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} fought with {%Śalya%}. (5)
{%Abhimanyu%} attacked {%Śalya. Duryodhana%}, etc. (ζ), protected
the chariot of {%Śalya. Bhīmasena%}, etc. (η), fought with them. (6)
{%Bhīmasena%}, with his mace, attacked {%Duryodhana%}, who advanced
with the {%Magadha-%}division, and placing the ruler of {%Magadha%}
before himself, {%Bhīmasena%} jumped from his chariot and slew the
elephants with his mace; the {%Draupadeyas%}, etc. (θ), protected
{%Bhīma's%} rear; {%Abhimanyu%} slew the {%Magadha%} king after
having slain his elephant (VI, {@62@}). (7) {%Duryodhana%}
commanded his entire army to slay {%Bhīmasena%}, who crushed
[Page142-b+ 63]
them with his mace, without being abandoned by {%Dhṛṣṭa-%}
{%dyumna%}, etc. (ι). (8) {%Bhīṣma%} attacked {%Bhīmasena%}. (9) {%Sātyaki%}
({%Śinipravīraḥ%}) attacked {%Bhīṣma%}. (10) Only the Rā. {%Alambuṣa%}
fought with the grandson of {%Śini%}. (11) Only {%Somadatta's%} son
{%Bhūriśravas%} was then of good cheer; he attacked {%Sātyaki%}
(VI, {@63@}). (12) {%Duryodhana%} and his brothers surrounded
{%Somadatta's%} son; {%Bhīmasena%} encountered the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%},
who were headed by {%Duryodhana; Nandaka%} (Dhārtarāṣṭra)
also attacked {%Bhīmasena%}, who addressed his charioteer {%Viśoka%},
that he should drive the steeds with care; {%Duryodhana%} also
wounded {%Viśoka; Duryodhana%} struck {%Bhīmasena%} so that he
swooned away. (13) The {%Pāṇḍava%} army, headed by {%Abhi-%}
{%manyu%}, showered arrows on {%Duryodhana; Bhīmasena%} regained
consciousness and fought against {%Duryodhana%} and {%Śalya%},
who was borne away from the battle. (14) Fourteen
{%Dhārtarāṣṭras%}, viz. {%Senāpati%}, etc. (κ), encountered {%Bhīma-%}
{%sena%}, who slew {%Senāpati%}, etc. (λ); the remaining six fled.
(15) Urged by {%Bhīṣma%}, the whole {%Dhārtarāṣṭra%} army
attacked {%Bhīmasena%}; the {%Prāgjyotiṣa%} king {%Bhagadatta%}, on
a huge elephant, struck {%Bhīmasena%}, who fell in a swoon.
(16) Then the Rā. {%Ghaṭotkaca%}, by help of his illusive force,
appeared riding on an {%Airāvata%}, followed by the other {%Dig-%}
{%nāgas%} (μ), each with four tusks and mounted by {%Rākṣasas%},
and attacked {%Bhagadatta's%} elephant. (17) {%Bhīṣma%} urged
{%Droṇa%} and {%Duryodhana%} to rescue {%Bhagadatta%}; all the kings,
headed by {%Droṇa%}, proceeded to aid {%Bhagadatta; Yudhiṣṭhira%},
with the {%Pāñcālas%} and {%Pāṇḍavas%}, pursued them from behind;
{%Ghaṭotkaca%} uttered a flerce roar; {%Bhīṣma%}, addressing {%Droṇa%},
caused the army to withdraw, and so did the {%Pāṇḍavas%} with
{%Bhīmasena%} and {%Ghaṭotkaca. Duryodhana%} was afflicted with
sorrow (VI, {@64@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} complained to {%Sañjaya%}, and
asked what was the cause of the victory of the {%Pāṇḍavas%}.
{%Sañjaya%} explained that victory sides with righteousness,
and related how {%Duryodhana%} in the night had enquired of
{%Bhīṣma%}, on whom the {%Pāṇḍavas%} were relying to vanquish
{%Droṇa%}, etc. (ν). {%Bhīṣma%} had related this ancient history:
In days of old all the gods and {%Ṛṣis%} were assembled by
{%Brahmán%} upon {%Gandhamādana%}; and when {%Brahmán%}, together
with the {%Ṛṣis%} and gods, beheld an excellent chariot in the
sky, he hymned {%Nārāyaṇa%} (ξ). “…Therefore take birth
in the race of {%Yadu%} and slay the sons of {%Diti…%} Having
created the divine {%Saṅkarṣaṇa%} out of thy own self by thyself,
thou didst then, O {%Kṛṣṇa%}, create thyself as {%Pradyumna%}, born
of thyself; from {%Pradyumna%} thou didst then create {%Ani-%}
{%ruddha%}, who is known as the eternal {%Viṣṇu%}; and it was
{%Aniruddha%} who created me as {%Brahmán%}, the upholder of the
Universe. Created out of {%Vāsudeva%}, I have therefore been
created by thee. Dividing thyself into portions, take birth
among human beings, and slaughtering the {%Asuras%} there
…thou wilt again truly attain to {%Yoga…”%} (VI, {@65@}).
Requested by D., R., and G., {%Brahmán%} explained to them who
{%Nārāyaṇa%} is. “Those Dai. and Dā. and Rā. who were slain
in battle have been born among men.” The old {%Ṛṣis Nara%} and
{%Nārāyaṇa%} are {%Arjuna%} and {%Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa%} should never be
disregarded as if he were a man. This was heard by {%Bhīṣma%}
from {%Ṛṣis%}, etc. (ο). “Never go to war with {%Kṛṣṇa%} and
the {%Pāṇḍavas%}; on account of thy folly thou couldst not appre-
hend this; I regard thee, therefore, as a wicked {%Rākṣasa%}.”
“Where {%Kṛṣṇa%} is, there is righteousness; and victory is
where righteousness is…It is {%Kṛṣṇa%} who always
imparts an understanding endued with righteousness and
strength in battle to the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, and who always protects
them from danger…He it is who, towards the close
[Page143-a+ 62]
of the {%Dvāpara yuga%} and the beginning of the {%Kali yuga%},
is hymned by {%Saṅkarṣaṇa%} according to the {%Sātvata%} ritual”
(VI, {@66@}). {%Bhīṣma%}, on the authority of {%Mārkaṇḍeya%}, declared
the origin and glory of {%Kṛṣṇa%}, his deeds and creations, to
{%Duryodhana%} (π) (VI, {@67@}). {%Bhīṣma%} cited a hymn to {%Nārāyaṇa%},
uttered by {%Brahmán%} himself, and communicated in days of
old by B.-ṛ. and G. on earth. {%Brahmán%}, who quoted {%Nārada%},
etc. (ρ), hymned {%Nārāyaṇa%} as the god of D., S. etc. (σ)
(VI, {@68@}).—§ 582: FIFTH DAY: After the night had passed
away, {%Bhīṣma%} proceeded in a {%Makara%} array, the {%Pāṇḍavas%} in
a {%Śyena%} array, in whose beak, etc., was {%Bhīmasena%}, etc. (α).
(1) {%Bhīmasena%}, penetrating the {%Makara%} array through its
mouth, attacked {%Bhīṣma%}; the {%Pāṇḍavas%} were confounded.
(2) Then {%Arjuna%} attacked {%Bhīṣma%}. (3) {%Duryodhana%}
addressed {%Droṇa%}, who attacked {%Sātyaki%} (the grandson of {%Śini%}).
(4) {%Bhīmasena%} attacked {%Droṇa%} in order to protect {%Sātyaki%}.
(5) {%Droṇa%}, etc. (β), attacked {%Bhīmasena%}. (6) {%Abhimanyu%}
and the {%Draupadeyas%} attacked the {%Kurus; Śikhaṇḍin%} attacked
{%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa; Bhīṣma%} avoided him. (7) Urged by
{%Duryodhana, Droṇa%} protected {%Bhīṣma; Śikhaṇḍin%} avoided
{%Droṇa%}. (8) {%Duryodhana%} protected {%Bhīṣma%}, who was attacked
by the {%Pāṇḍavas%} with {%Arjuna%} at their head (VI, {@69@}). An awful
carnage ensued. (9) {%Duryodhana%} and the {%Kāliṅgas%} placed
{%Bhīṣma%} at their head and attacked the {%Pāṇḍavas%}; the
{%Pāṇḍavas%}, supporting {%Bhīma%}, attacked {%Bhīṣma%} (VI, {@70@}).
{%Arjuna (b%}) attacked {%Bhīṣma%} with the {%Gāṇḍīva (c%}); the {%Kurus%}
were afraid and seemed to melt away. (10) Then, with steeds
of the {%Kāmboja%} breed, the {%Kāliṅga%} king, etc. (γ), surrounded
{%Śakuni. Bhīṣma%}, etc., fought with {%Arjuna%}, etc. (δ); {%Drupada%},
etc. (ε), fought with {%Droṇa; Kṛpa%} and {%Kṛtavarman%} attacked
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} (VI, {@71@}). {%Arjuna%} encountered {%Droṇa%}, etc.
(ζ). {%Sātyaki%}, etc. (η), attacked {%Śālva%} and the {%Kaikeyas%}.
{%Dhṛṣṭaketu%} and {%Ghaṭotkaca%} attacked the chariot-division of
the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras. Bhīṣma%} checked {%Bhīmasena. Sātyaki%}
({%Yuyudhāna%}) attacked {%Bhīṣma%}, but had his charioteer slain.
{%Bhīṣma%} slew the {%Pāṇḍava%} forces; but the {%Pāñcālas%} and the
{%Somakas%} again attacked {%Bhīṣma%}. (11) {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, etc.,
attacked {%Bhīṣma; Bhīṣma, Droṇa%}, etc., attacked the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
(VI, {@72@}).
<C n="1"/>{%Virāṭa%}. <C n="2"/>{%Aśvatthāman%}. <C n="3"/>{%Duryodhana%}.
<C n="1"/>{%Bhīṣma%}. <C n="2"/>{%Arjuna%}. <C n="3"/>{%Bhīmasena%}.
{%Abhimanyu%} attacked {%Citrasena%}, etc. (θ). (12) {%Duryodhana%}
attacked {%Abhimanyu%}, and so did {%Lakṣmaṇa%} (grandson of
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}), who had his steeds and charioteer slain, and
was carried away by {%Kṛpa%} on his chariot. The {%Sṛñjayas%}
fought with the {%Kurus%} with their fists; {%Bhīṣma%} slew the
troops of the {%Pāṇḍavas%} with his celestial weapons (VI, {@73@}).
(13) {%Sātyaki (Yuyudhāna%}) slew innumerable foes with his
arrows; {%Duryodhana%} despatched 10,000 chariots against
him, but he destroyed them all with his celestial weapons.
{%Sātyaki & Bhūriśravas (d); Sātyaki's%} combatants fled and
abandoned him; ten sons of {%Yuyudhāna & Bhūriśravas%}
(son of {%Bāhlīka's%} son {%Somadatta%}) towards the afternoon;
{%Bhūriśravas%} slew them; {%Sātyaki & Bhūriśravas%}, each of
them slew the other's chariot-steeds; {%Bhīmasena%} took
{%Sātyaki%} up on his own chariot, and {%Duryodhana Bhūriśravas%}
on his. (14) The {%Pāṇḍavas & Bhīṣma; Duryodhana%}
urged 25,000 to slay {%Arjuna%}, who, however, slew them
all. The {%Matsyas%} and {%Kekayas%} surrounded {%Arjuna%} and
{%Abhimanyu%}. At sunset {%Bhīṣma%} caused the troops to be
withdrawn, and so did the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and the {%Sṛñjayas%}
(VI, {@74@}).—§ 583: THE SIXTH DAY: After the night had
[Page143-b+ 63]
passed away, the {%Kurus%} and the {%Pāṇḍavas%} once more set
out for battle. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} caused {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} to
dispose the troops in the {%Makara%} array: {%Drupada%} and
{%Arjuna%} = head; {%Sahadeva%} and {%Nakula%} = two eyes; {%Bhīma-%}
{%sena%} = beak; {%Abhimanyu%}, etc. (α) = neck; {%Virāṭa%} and
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} = back; five {%Kekaya%} brothers = left wing;
{%Dhṛṣṭaketu%} and {%Cekitāna%} = right wing; {%Kuntibhoja%} and
{%Śatānīka%} = two feet; {%Śikhaṇḍin%}, etc. (β) = tail. {%Bhīṣma%}
disposed his army in the form of a huge crane: {%Droṇa%}
= beak; {%Aśvatthāman%} and {%Kṛpa%} = two eyes; {%Kṛtavarman%},
etc. (γ) = head; {%Śūrasena%} and {%Duryodhana%} = neck; the
{%Prāgjyotiṣa%} king, etc. (δ) = breast; the {%Prasthala%} king
{%Suśarman%} = left wing; the {%Tuṣāras%}, etc. (ε) = right wing;
{%Śrutāyus%}, etc. (ζ) = rear. The {%Pāṇḍava%} army was protected
by {%Bhīmasena%}, etc. (η); the {%Kaurava%} army by {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (θ).
(1) {%Bhīmasena & Droṇa%}, who had his charioteer slain and then
himself restrained his steeds. (2) Slaughtered by {%Droṇa%} and
{%Bhīṣma%}, the {%Sṛñjayas%} and {%Kekayas%} took to flight; and so did
the {%Kauravas%}, mangled by {%Bhīma%} and {%Arjuna%} (VI, {@75@}).
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} recounted the excellency of the {%Kaurava%} army,
protected by {%Droṇa%}, etc. (ι). Neither men nor {%Ṛṣis%} of old
ever beheld such an army. That it should yet be slaughtered,
he thought was due only to fate (or to the Creator); {%Vidura%}
had spoken well, but the wicked {%Duryodhana%} would not
accept (VI, {@76@}). (3) {%Bhīmasena%} & the younger brothers of
{%Duryodhana: Duḥśāsana%}, etc. (κ); {%Bhīma%} left his chariot and
took up his mace. (4) {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} (forsaking {%Droṇa%})
proceeded towards {%Śakuni%}; seeing {%Bhīma's%} empty chariot, he
became afflicted, but was comforted by the words of {%Viśoka%};
he took {%Bhīma%}, who was surrounded by foes on all sides,
into his chariot. (5) The {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%} ({%Duryodhana%}, etc.)
& {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} (who applied the weapon {%Pramohana%}).
(6) {%Droṇa & Drupada%} (who left the battle); the {%Somakas%}
were struck with fear. (7) {%Droṇa%}, with the weapon {%Prajñā%},
neutralized the {%Pramohana%} weapon in order to rescue {%Dhṛta-%}
{%rāṣṭra's%} sons. (8) {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} sent the {%Kaikeyas%}, etc. (λ),
headed by {%Abhimanyu%}, arrayed in a {%Sūcīmukha%}, to help {%Bhīma%}
and {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} troops were quite helpless,
like a lady in the streets. (9) {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, causing {%Bhīma%}
to be taken into the chariot of the {%Kekaya%} king, attacked {%Droṇa%},
who slew his charioteer and steeds; {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} ascended
the chariot of {%Abhimanyu; Droṇa%} broke the {%Pāṇḍava%} army
(VI, {@77@}). (10) {%Duryodhana & Bhīma%} (who ascended his own
chariot); {%Bhīma & Citrasena%}, etc. (11) {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} sent
12 chariot-warriors ({%Abhimanyu%}, etc.) to follow {%Bhīmasena%} from
behind; seeing them, the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%} abandoned {%Bhīma%}.
In the afternoon {%Duryodhana%} attacked {%Abhimanyu%} and {%Bhīma-%}
{%sena; Abhimanyu & Vikarṇa%}, who had his steeds slain and
mounted on the chariot of {%Citrasena; Abhimanyu & Durjaya%} and
{%Vikarṇa; Duḥśāsana%} & the five {%Kekaya%} brothers; {%Draupadeyāḥ%}
{%& Duryodhana%} (VI, {@78@}). {%Duryodhana (b) & Bhīmasena%} (who
said that he, by slaying {%D.%}, would dispel the sorrows of
{%Kuntī%}, etc.) (μ). (12) The {%Sindhu%} king came to the rescue
of {%Duryodhana; Kṛpa%} caused {%Duryodhana%} to mount his
own chariot; {%Jayadratha & Bhīmasena%}. (13) {%Dhṛṣṭaketu%},
etc. (ν), & the sons of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra; Abhimanyu & Vikarṇa%}
(who had his charioteer and steeds slain, and was himself
pierced); {%Durmukha & Śrutakarman%} (who had his steeds
slain); {%Sutasoma%} took {%Śrutakarman%} into his own chariot;
{%Śrutakīrti & Jayatseṅa%} (Dhārtarāṣṭra); {%Śatānīka & Jayatsena%};
{%Duṣkarṇa & Śatānīka%}, who slew {%Duṣkarṇa; Śatānīka%} was
surrounded by foes. (14) The five {%Kekaya%} brothers & the sons
of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra: Durmukha%}, etc. (ξ). About sunset {%Bhīṣma%}
[Page144-a+ 63]
broke the ranks of the {%Pāṇḍavas%}; and so did {%Yudhiṣṭhira%},
having smelt the heads of {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} and {%Bhīmasena%}
(VI, {@79@}). {%Duryodhana%} sought {%Bhīṣma%} in the night and
gave expression to his grief at the success of the {%Pāṇḍavas%};
{%Bhīṣma%} promised to do his best, at which {%Duryodhana%} was
delighted (VI, {@80@}).—§ 584: THE SEVENTH DAY: {%Bhīṣma%}
said to {%Duryodhana%} that he himself, etc. (α), were all prepared
to battle for his sake; that the {%Pāṇḍavas%} could not be
vanquished by the very gods including {%Indra%}, having {%Kṛṣṇa%}
for their ally, etc.; but that he would either vanquish them
or be vanquished by them. He gave {%Duryodhana%} a herb of
great efficacy for healing his wounds. At dawn {%Bhīṣma%}
disposed his troops in a {%Maṇḍala%} array (description), protected
by {%Bhīṣma%}, who was again protected by {%Citrasena%}, etc.;
{%Duryodhana%} looked like {%Śakra%} himself. Then the {%Dhārta-%}
{%rāṣṭras%} began to proceed, facing the west. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
disposed his troops in a {%Vajra%} array. (|) {%Droṇa%} & the
{%Matsya%} king; {%Aśvatthāman & Śikhaṇḍin; Duryodhana &%}
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Nakula%} and {%Sahadeva%} & the {%Madra%} king;
{%Vinda%} and {%Anuvinda & Irāvat%}; many kings & {%Arjuna%};
{%Bhīmasena & Kṛtavarman Hārdikya; Abhimanyu & Citrasena%},
etc. (β) (sons of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}); {%Ghaṭotkaca%} & the {%Prāgjyotiṣa%}
king; {%Alambuṣa & Sātyaki; Bhūriśravas & Dhṛṣṭaketu%};
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} & king {%Śrutāyus; Cekitāna & Kṛpa%}. Others
proceeded against {%Bhīma%}, and thousands against {%Arjuna%},
among others the {%Trigarta%} king with his brothers. D., D.-ṛ.,
G., and U. wondered, beholding the two {%Kṛṣṇas%} (i.e. Kṛṣṇa
and Arjuna). {%Arjuna%} invoked the {%Aindra%} weapon; the foes
fled, but were rescued by {%Bhīṣma%} (VI, {@81@}). (2) After
{%Suśarman%} had ceased fighting, and the {%Kuru%} army had been
routed by {%Arjuna%}, and {%Bhīṣma%} had proceeded against the
chariot of {%Arjuna, Duryodhana%} exhorted the kings and
{%Suśarman%} to protect {%Bhīṣma%}, who resembled the planet
{%Śukra%} (Venus) and was surrounded by the {%Trigartas. Droṇa%}
& the {%Matsya%} king ({%Virāṭa%}), who mounted the chariot of
{%Śaṅkha%} (his son), who was slain by {%Droṇa; Virāṭa%} fled.
{%Śikhaṇḍin & Aśvatthāman; Śikhaṇḍin%} descended, fought first
with a sword, then mounted {%Sālyaki's%} chariot. {%Sātyaki &%}
{%Alambuṣa; Sātyaki%} employed the {%Aindra%} weapon which
he had obtained from {%Arjuna%}, and destroyed the creations
of {%Alambuṣa's%} illusive power; {%Alambuṣa%} fled. {%Dhṛṣṭa-%}
{%dyumna & Duryodhana%}, who was forced to descend, mounted
{%Śakuni's%} chariot. {%Kṛtavarman & Bhīmasena; Kṛtavarman%}
went to the chariot of {%Vṛṣaka%} in the very sight of {%Śalya%} and
{%Duryodhana%} (VI, {@82@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} spoke to {%Sañjaya%} about
the cheerfulness of the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and the cheerlessness of the
{%Kurus%}, which he thought was destiny. (3) In the forenoon:
The two {%Avanti%} princes & {%Irāvat%} (the daughter's son of the
king of the {%Nāgas%}); {%Anuvinda%} mounted the chariot of {%Vinda%};
the horses ran away with the chariot. {%Ghaṭotkava & Bhaga-%}
{%datta%}; D., G., and Ṛ. came there; except {%Ghaṭotkaca%}, the other
{%Pāṇḍava%} warriors fled, but rallied. (4) The {%Prāgjyotiṣa%}
king & {%Ghaṭotkaca%}, who fled. The ruler of the {%Madras%}
({%Śalya%}) & the twins; {%Nakula%} must mount the chariot
of {%Sahadeva; Śalya%} was borne away by his charioteer
(VI, {@83@}). When the sun reached the meridian: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
{%& Śrutāyus%}; D., G., and Rā. trembled; R. and D. prayed
for the peace of the world; {%Śrutāyus%} fled, and the troops of
{%Duryodhana%} turned away. {%Cekitāna & Kṛpa; Cekitāna%} was
forced to descend and took up a mace, and then a sword;
{%Karakarṣa%} took {%Cekitāna%} into his chariot, and {%Śakuni%} took
{%Kṛpa%} into his. {%Dhṛṣṭaketu & Bhūriśravas%} (the son of
{%Somadatta%}); {%Dhṛṣṭaketu%} mounted the chariot of {%Śatānīka%}.
[Page144-b+ 63]
{%Citrasena%}, etc. (γ), & {%Abhimanyu%}, who did not slay them,
remembering {%Bhīma's%} words. {%Arjuna%} caused {%Kṛṣṇa%} to direct
the chariot against {%Bhīṣma; Arjuna & Suśarman%} (VI, {@84@});
many were slain by {%Arjuna%}. (5) The {%Trigarta%} king and thirty-
two others attacked {%Arjuna%}, who slew sixty (so C.) chariot-
warriors, and sped to kill {%Bhīṣma%}. (6) The {%Trigarta%} king
attacked {%Arjuna; Śikhaṇḍin%}, etc., came to his rescue; {%Arjuna%}
shot at them with the {%Gāṇḍīva%}. (7) {%Duryodhana%}, with {%Jaya-%}
{%dratha%}, etc., came to protect {%Bhīṣma%} against {%Arjuna%},
who, avoiding them, attacked {%Bhīṣma%}, as did also {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%}, etc. (δ), avoiding the {%Madra%} king. {%Kṛpa%}, etc. (ε), shot
at the {%Pāṇḍavas. Śikhaṇḍin%} fled, but, rebuked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%},
who reminded him of his oath, he again attacked {%Bhīṣma%}.
{%Śalya & Śikhaṇḍin%}, who employed the {%Vāruṇa%} weapon.
{%Bhīmasena%} (mace in hand) & {%Jayadratha; Citrasena &%}
{%Bhīmasena%} (VI, {@85@}); {%Citrasena%} mounted on {%Vikarṇa's%} chariot.
{%Bhīṣma & Yudhiṣṭhira%} (accompanied by the twins), who
mounted {%Nakula's%} chariot. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} urged the kings to
slay {%Bhīṣma. Śikhaṇḍin & Bhīṣma%}, who disregarded him,
remembering that he had formerly been a wife; the {%Sṛñjayas%}
{%& Bhīṣma%}. (8) {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} and {%Sātyaki%} slaughter the
{%Kuru%} army. (9) {%Vinda%} and {%Anuvinda%} attacked {%Dhṛṣṭa-%}
{%dyumna%}, who mounted {%Sātyaki's%} chariot. (10) {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
attacked {%Vinda%} and {%Anuvinda%}, protected by {%Duryodhana%}.
(11) {%Arjuna%} fought against many foes. (12) {%Droṇa%} began
to consume the {%Pāñcālas%} like fire a heap of cotton. (13)
{%Duryodhana%} and his brothers surrounded {%Bhīṣma%} and
fought against the {%Pāṇḍavas%}. At sunset Rā., Pś., etc.,
were seen all around. At sunset {%Arjuna%} (having vanquished
{%Suśarman%}, etc.), {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} with his brothers, {%Bhīma-%}
{%sena%} (having vanquished {%Duryodhana%}, etc.), {%Duryodhana%}
(protecting {%Bhīṣma%}), {%Droṇa%}, etc., proceeded to their tents
(VI, {@86@}).—§ 585: THE EIGHTH DAY: Having passed the
night, the {%Kauravas%} and {%Pāṇḍavas%} once more proceeded to
battle. {%Duryodhana%}, etc. (α), formed the array, having
{%Bhīṣma%} with the {%Mālavas%}, etc., in the van (β); next to him
was {%Droṇa%} with the {%Pulindas%}, etc. (γ); next to {%Droṇa%} was
{%Bhagadatta%} with the {%Magadhas%}, etc. (δ); behind him was the
{%Kośala%} king {%Bṛhadbala%} with the {%Melakas%}, etc. (ε); next to
him the {%Prasthala%} king {%Traigarta%}, etc. (ζ); next to the
{%Trigarta%} king was {%Aśvatthāman%}; next to him {%Duryodhana%}
with the whole army and his brothers; behind him {%Kṛpa%}.
Urged by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} formed a {%Śṛṅgāṭaka%}
array: {%Bhīmasena%} and {%Sātyaki%}, etc. = the horns; next to
them {%Arjuna%} and {%Kṛṣṇa; Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (η) = the centre;
{%Abhimanyu%}, etc. (θ) = rear. Description of the battle.
{%Bhīṣma & Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} (VI, {@87@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira &%}
{%Bhīṣma. Bhīmasena & Bhīṣma%}, who was protected by
{%Duryodhana%} and his brothers; the steeds ran away with
{%Bhīṣma; Bhīmasena%} slew eight sons of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra: Sunābha%},
etc. (ι). Then the other sons of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} all fled
away. {%Duryodhana%} urged his brothers to kill {%Bhīma%}. They
remembered the words of {%Vidura. Duryodhana%} blamed
{%Bhīṣma%}, who reminded him of the words of {%Droṇa%}, etc. (κ)
(VI, {@88@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} complained to {%Sañjaya%} that his
sons, though assisted by {%Droṇa%}, etc. (λ), were still slain;
“What can be the reason save fate?” He regretted that
the wicked {%Duryodhana%} had not obeyed {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (μ).
{%Sañjaya%} said that {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} ought to have restrained his
sons from gambling. At noon the whole {%Pāṇḍava%} army, at
the command of {%Yudhiṣṭhira—Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, etc. (ν)—
rushed against {%Bhīṣma%} alone. {%Arjuna%}, etc. (ξ), rushed
against all the kings under the command of {%Duryodhana%}.
[Page145-a+ 63]
A third body was formed of {%Abhimanyu%}, etc. (ο). {%Droṇa%}
slew the {%Somakas%} and {%Sṛñjayas; Bhīmasena%}, principally the
elephant division of the {%Kurus; Nakula%} and {%Sahadeva%}, the
cavalry; the {%Pāṇḍavas%} were destroyed by {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (π)
(VI, {@89@}). {%Śakuni%} and {%Kṛtavarman Hārdikya%} attacked the
{%Pāṇḍavas%}. With horses of the {%Kāmboja%}, etc. (ρ), breed
{%Arjuna's%} son {%Irāvat (b%}) attacked the {%Kauravas%}, and with his
steeds brought about great confusion in their cavalry.
{%Śakuni%} + his six brothers {%Gaja%}, etc. (σ), & {%Irāvat%}, who
slew them except {%Vṛṣabha. Duryodhana%} urged {%Ṛṣyaśṛṅga's%}
son the Rā. ({%c) [Alambuṣa]%} (who hated {%Bhīmasena%} because
he had killed {%Baka%}) to slay {%Irāvat%}; both of them had
recourse to magic; {%Nāgas%} came to the rescue of {%Irāvat%}, but
were consumed by a phantom in the form of {%Garuḍa%}: then
{%Irāvat%} became confounded and was slain by {%[Alambuṣa]%}.
{%Arjuna%}, etc. (τ), slew many. Both armies fought as if
they were all possessed by {%Rākṣasas%} and demons ({%rakṣo-%}
{%bhūtair%}; B. {%rakṣobhūtā%}) (VI, {@90@}). {%Ghaṭotkaca%}, etc., &
{%Duryodhana%} + the {%Vaṅga%} king with 10,000 elephants; {%Duryo-%}
{%dhana%} slew four Rā.: {%Vegavat%}, etc. (υ); {%Ghaṭotkaca%} threatened

of {%Duryodhana%} (VI, {@92@}). {%Bhīma%}, urged by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%},
came to the rescue of {%Ghaṭotkaca%}, with {%Satyadhṛti%}, etc. (ψ).
The {%Kurus%} left {%Ghaṭotkaca%} and fled (VI, {@93@}). {%Duryodhana &%}
{%Bhīmasena%}, who was wounded; {%Abhimanyu%}, etc., & {%Duryodhana%};
urged by {%Droṇa, Somadatta%}, etc. (ω), attacked the {%Pāṇḍavas%};

{%Ghaṭotkaca%} + many other Rā.; {%Droṇa%} & Rā.; {%Ghaṭotkaca%}
confounded {%Aśvatthāman%} by magic; the {%Kurus%} and {%Droṇa%},
etc. (αα), seemed to fly, etc.; then, towards sunset, the
{%Kuru%} troops fled, notwithstanding the words of {%Sañjaya%} and
{%Bhīṣma%} (VI, {@94@}). {%Duryodhana%} complained to {%Bhīṣma%} that
he had not himself been able to slay {%Ghaṭotkaca. Bhīṣma%}
said {%Duryodhana%} should always battle with {%Yudhiṣṭhira%},
etc. (ββ), while {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (γγ), would battle against
{%Ghaṭotkaca%}; or {%Bhagadatta%} should fight against {%Ghaṭotkaca%}.

{%Sātyaki; Ambastha & Abhimanyu; Bhīma%} felled {%Vyūḍhoraska%},
etc. (θθ). Then the other sons of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} fled. {%Ambastha%}
got upon the chariot of {%Kṛtavarman. Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, etc.,
battled with the {%Kurus%}. When dark set in, both parties
withdrew their armies (VI, {@96@}). {%Duryodhana%} consulted
{%Śakuni%}, etc. (ιι), as to why {%Droṇa%}, etc. (κκ), did not resist the
{%Pārthas. Karṇa%} asked {%Duryodhana%} to see {%Bhīṣma%} and solicit
him to withdraw from the battle in order to permit {%Karṇa%} to
fight the foe. {%Duryodhana%} set out for {%Bhīṣma's%} tent
(description), and asked {%Bhīṣma%} to retire if he was not
[Page145-b+ 63]
competent to slay the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, etc. (λλ) (VI, {@97@}). {%Bhīṣma%}
spoke to {%Duryodhana%} about the invincibility of the {%Pāṇḍavas%},
mentioning the {%Khāṇḍava%} forest, etc. (μμ), and {%Kṛṣṇa%} (citing
{%Nārada%} and other great Ṛ.); he promised to display all
his valour on the next day; only {%Śikhaṇḍin%}—who was really
{%Śikhaṇḍinī%}—he would not slay. {%Duryodhana%} told {%Duḥśāsana%}
to let all their twenty-two divisions protect {%Bhīṣma%} against
{%Śikhaṇḍin%}, especially {%Śakuni%}, etc. (νν). Thus they proceeded
to battle. “{%Yudhāmanyu%} protected {%Arjuna's%} left wheel, {%Utta-%}
{%manjas%} his right wheel, and {%Arjuna%} protected {%Śikhaṇḍin%}.”
{%Arjuna%} told {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} to place {%Śikhaṇḍin%} before {%Bhīṣma%};
he would himself be his protector (VI, {@98@}).—§ 586: THE
NINTH DAY: {%Bhīṣma%} disposed his troops in a {%Sarvatobhadra%}
array: {%Kṛpa%}, etc. (α), in the van; {%Droṇa%}, etc. (β), on the
right wing; {%Aśvatthāman%}, etc. (γ) = left wing; {%Duryodhana%},
etc. (δ), in the midst; {%Alambuṣa%} and {%Śrutāyus%} in the rear.
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (ε), stood in the van; then there were
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, etc. (ζ). The {%Kuru%} troops were headed by
{%Bhīṣma%}, the {%Pāṇḍava%} troops by {%Bhīmasena%} (VI, {@99@}).
Description of the heroism of {%Abhimanyu%}, confounding
{%Kṛpa%}, etc. (η). {%Duryodhana%} despatched {%Alambuṣa%} to slay
{%Abhimanyu%}, while they, headed by {%Bhīṣma%} and {%Droṇa%}, would
slay {%Arjuna. Alambuṣa & Abhimanyu; Alambuṣa%} slaughtered
the {%Pāṇḍava%} host; the {%Draupadeyas%} (especially {%Prativindhya%})
& {%Alambuṣa%} (VI, {@100@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} asked {%Sañjaya%} what
was done by {%Alambuṣa%}, etc. (θ). {%Alambuṣa & Abhimanyu%},
who defeated him. {%Bhīṣma & Abhimanyu%}, who slaughtered
the {%Kaurava%} army. {%Arjuna%} (surrounded by the {%Pāṇḍavas%})
& {%Bhīṣma%} (protected by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} sons); {%Kṛpa & Arjuna%};
{%Sātyaki & Kṛpa; Sātyaki & Aśvatthāman; Droṇa & Sātyaki%};
{%Arjuna & Droṇa%} (VI, {@101@}); {%Duryodhana%} despatched {%Suśarman%}
to take up the wing of {%Droṇa%}; the {%Trigarta%} king (and his
son) & {%Arjuna%}; D. and Dā. were highly gratified; {%Arjuna%}
employed the {%Vāyavya%} weapon, {%Droṇa%} the {%Śaila%} weapon;
the {%Trigarta%} division turned away; {%Duryodhana%}, etc. (ι),
surrounded {%Arjuna; Bhagadatta%}, etc. (κ), surrounded {%Bhīma%};
{%Bhūriśravas%}, etc. (λ), & the twins; {%Bhīṣma%} (+ the sons of
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}) & {%Yudhiṣṭhira; Bhīmasena%}, with his mace,
slaughtered the elephants. {%Duryodhana's%} troops fled (VI, {@102@}).
{%Bhīṣma%} & the {%Somakas; Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, etc. (μ), & {%Bhīṣma%};
the {%Draupadeyas%}, etc. (ν), & {%Bhīṣma%}; the {%Kuru%} army protected
{%Bhīṣma%}, who slaughtered the {%Pāṇḍava%} army; the combatants
censured {%Duryodhana%}, who urged {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (ξ), to fight
(VI, {@103@}). {%Arjuna%} slew all the followers of {%Suśarman%};
{%Duryodhana (+ Bhīṣma) & Arjuna%}. At noon: {%Sātyaki &%}
{%Kṛtavarman; Drupada & Droṇa; Bhīmasena & Bāhlīka%};
{%Abhimanyu & Citrasena%}, who mounted the chariot of {%Durmukha%};
{%Droṇa & Drupada%}, who retreated; {%Bāhlīka%} mounted the
chariot of {%Lakṣmaṇa; Sātyaki & Bhīṣma%}; the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
attacked {%Bhīṣma%} in order to rescue {%Sātyaki%}; battle between
them and the {%Kurus%} (VI, {@104@}). At the request of {%Duryodhana%},
{%Duḥśāsana%} protected {%Bhīṣma. Śakuni%} checked {%Nakula%}, etc. (ο).
{%Duryodhana%} despatched 10,000 horsemen, who were checked
by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (π). {%Duryodhana%} urged {%Śalya%} against
{%Yudhiṣṭhira; Śalya & Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (ρ); {%Bhīma%} came to
the rescue of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}. When the sun was sinking, there
commenced a fierce and terrible battle (VI, {@105@}). {%Bhīṣma%}
{%& Bhīma%}, etc. (σ). {%Droṇa & Sātyaki (+ Bhīmasena%}).
{%Bhīṣma%} & the {%Sauvīras%}, etc. (τ); {%Bhīṣma%} & 14,000 {%Cedis%},
etc. (υ), who were slain. {%Kṛṣṇa%} urged {%Arjuna%} to slay {%Bhīṣma%}
(mentioning his words by {%Virāṭa%}). {%Arjuna & Bhīṣma%}.
{%Kṛṣṇa%} left his chariot, and rushed at {%Bhīṣma%}, whip in
hand, but was brought back by {%Arjuna%} (VI, {@106@}). When
[Page146-a+ 63]
the sun set, both parties withdrew their forces. The
{%Pāṇḍavas%}, etc. (ϕ), sat down for a consultation about {%Bhīṣma%};
{%Kṛṣṇa%} said that {%Arjuna%}, etc. (χ), were invincible, mentioning
{%Arjuna's%} words at {%Upaplavya%} (ψ). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} proposed to
go to {%Bhīṣma%} himself and ask him the means of his death.
{%Kṛṣṇa%} approved of the proposal, and they went to the tent
of {%Bhīṣma%}, who advised {%Arjuna%} to fight with him, placing
{%Śikhaṇḍin%} before himself. {%Arjuna%} grieved at the prospect of
striking {%Bhīṣma%}, but was reminded by {%Kṛṣṇa%} of his vow to
slay {%Bhīṣma%} (the words of {%Bṛhaspati%} to {%Indra%} in days of old
also being quoted). The {%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} went away
with rejoicing hearts (VI, {@107@}).—§ 587: THE TENTH DAY:
Towards sunrise the {%Pāṇḍava%} army went out for battle, placing
{%Śikhaṇḍin%} in their van; {%Bhīmasena%} and {%Arjuna%} became the
protectors of his wheels; in his rear were the {%Draupadeyas%}
and {%Abhimanyu%}, protected by {%Sātyaki%} and {%Cekitāna%}; behind
them was {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, protected by the {%Pāñcālas%}; next
to him was {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} with the twins; next behind him
{%Virāṭa%}; next to him {%Drupada%}; the five {%Kekaya%} brothers and
{%Dhṛṣṭaketu%} protected the rear. At their head the {%Kurus%} had
{%Bhīṣma (b%}), protected by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} sons; next behind
them {%Droṇa%} and {%Aśvatthāman%}; next behind was {%Bhagadatta%}
with his elephant division; behind him {%Kṛpa%} and {%Kṛtavarman%};
behind them the {%Kāmboja%} king {%Sudakṣiṇa%}, etc. (α). The
{%Pārthas%} with {%Arjuna%} at their head, placing {%Śikhaṇḍin%} in the
van, proceeded against {%Bhīṣma. Bhīma%}, etc. (β), slew many.
{%Bhīṣma & Pāṇḍavas%}, etc. (γ); {%Bhīṣma & Śikhaṇḍin%} (who
mentioned {%Bhīṣma & Rāma Jāmadagnya%}); {%Arjuna%} urged
{%Śikhaṇḍin%} to slay {%Bhīṣma%}, while {%Arjuna%} would check {%Droṇa%},
etc. (δ) (VI, {@108@}). {%Bhīṣma%} slew the {%Pāñcālas%} and the
{%Pāṇḍava%} army. {%Arjuna%} slew the {%Kuru%} army. {%Duryodhana%}
complained of {%Arjuna%} before {%Bhīṣma%}, and of {%Sātyaki%}, etc. (ε).
{%Bhīṣma%} said he would “to-day” either be slain or slay the
{%Pāṇḍavas%}, and he slew hundreds of thousands (VI, {@109@}).
Urged by {%Arjuna, Śikhaṇḍin%}, and so also {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%},
etc. (ζ), attacked {%Bhīṣma; Citrasena & Cekitāna; Kṛtavarman%}
{%& Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Somadatta's%} son & {%Bhīmasena; Vikarṇa &%}
{%Nakula; Kṛpa & Sahadeva; Durmukha & Ghaṭotkaca; Duryo-%}
{%dhana & Sātyaki%}; the {%Kāmboja%} king {%Sudakṣiṇa & Abhimanyu%};
{%Aśvatthāman & Virāṭa + Drupada; Droṇa & Yudhiṣṭhira%};
{%Duḥśāsana & Arjuna + Śikhaṇḍin%}; etc.; {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}
(exciting the troops for aiding {%Arjuna%}) & {%Bhīṣma; Arjuna%}
could not advance further than to the chariot of {%Duḥśāsana%},
who also shot at {%Kṛṣṇa; Duḥśāsana%} for a moment sought
refuge by {%Bhīṣma%}; then he again attacked {%Arjuna%} (VI, {@110@});
{%Alambuṣa & Sātyaki; Bhagadatta & Sātyaki; Duryodhana &%}
{%Sātyaki%}; the {%Kāmboja%} king & {%Abhimanyu; Śikhaṇḍin &%}
{%Bhīṣma; Virāṭa + Drupada & Bhīṣma; Aśvatthāman &%}
{%Virāṭa + Drupada; Kṛpa & Sahadeva; Vikarṇa & Nakula%};
{%Durmukha & Ghaṭotkaca; Kṛtavarman & Dhṛṣṭadyumna%};
{%Bhūriśravas & Bhīmasena; Droṇa & Yudhiṣṭhira%}; the
{%Prabhadrakas%} began to tremble; {%Citrasena & Cekitāna%};
{%Arjuna%} compelled {%Duḥśāsana%} to retire, and then crushed
the {%Kuru%} troops; {%Duḥśāsana%} again resisted him (VI, {@111@}).
{%Droṇa%} became cheerless upon beholding unfavourable omens
(η); mentioning {%Śikhaṇḍin%} and {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (θ), he
urged {%Aśvatthāman%} to attack {%Śikhaṇḍin%} and {%Bhīmasena%}
(VI, {@112@}). {%Bhagadatta%}, etc. (ι) (ten warriors urged by
{%Droṇa%}) & {%Bhīmasena%}, who was also attacked by {%Duryodhana%};
{%Jayadratha%} mounted the chariot of {%Citrasena; Viśoka%} was
wounded by {%Śalya; Arjuna%} came, placing {%Śikhaṇḍin%} before
himself, and approached {%Bhīma%}. Then {%Duryodhana%} urged the
{%Trigarta%} king (who ruled {%Prasthala%}) {%Suśarman%} to slay {%Arjuna%}
[Page146-b+ 63]
and {%Bhīmasena; Suśarman & Arjuna + Bhīmasena%} (VI, {@113@});
{%Arjuna & Śalya%}, etc. (κ); {%Jayadratha%} also attacked {%Bhīma%};
so did also {%Śalya%}, who also shot at {%Kṛṣṇa; Droṇa%} + the
{%Māgadha%} king {%Jayatsena%} (commanded by {%Duryodhana%}) &
{%Arjuna + Bhīmasena; Jayatsena%} was carried away by his steeds.
Then {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (λ), & {%Bhīmasena + Arjuna; Dhṛṣṭa-%}
{%dyumna & Bhīṣma; Śikhaṇḍin & Bhīṣma; Yudhiṣṭhira%},
etc. (μ), & {%Bhīṣma%}. A terrible battle ensued, mainly turning
upon whether {%Bhīṣma%} should be victorious or vanquished
(VI, {@114@}). At {%Bhīṣma's%} own request: {%Yudhiṣṭhira +%}
{%Arjuna%}, etc. (ν), & {%Bhīṣma%}, who gave up all desire of pro-
tecting his own life. Urged by {%Duryodhana, Droṇa%}, etc. (ξ)
(placing {%Bhīṣma%} in their van), & the {%Pārthas%} (headed by
{%Śikhaṇḍin%}), especially {%Arjuna%}, etc. (ο); the grandson of {%Śini%}

doubt of PCR.); {%Yudhiṣṭhira & Śalya; Bhīmasena &%} the
elephant division; {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna & Droṇa; Bṛhadbala (c) &%}
{%Abhimanyu (d%}); the sons of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, etc., & {%Śikhaṇḍin +%}
{%Arjuna%} (VI, {@115@}); {%Abhimanyu & Duryodhana; Aśvatthāman &%}
{%Sātyaki; Paurava & Dhṛṣṭaketu; Jayatsena (Dhārtarāṣṭra%})
carried {%Paurava%} away on his chariot, and {%Sahadeva%} carried away
{%Dhṛṣṭaketu; Citrasena & Suśarman; Abhimanyu & Bṛhadbala%}
(the {%Kośala%} king); {%Bhīmasena%} slaughtered the elephants;
{%Yudhiṣṭhira & Śalya; Jayadratha & Virāṭa; Droṇa &%}
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Arjuna & Bhīṣma; Bhagadatta & Arjuna%},
who urged {%Śikhaṇḍin%} to slay {%Bhīṣma; Bhagadatta%} (leaving
{%Arjuna%}) & {%Drupada; Arjuna%} (placing {%Śikhaṇḍin%} ahead) &
{%Bhīṣma%}; the {%Kurus%} attacked {%Arjuna; Śikhaṇḍin%} attacked
{%Bhīṣma%}; 14,000 {%Cedis%}, etc. (π), were slain by {%Bhīṣma%}, and
so the {%Somakas%}; no chariot-warrior ventured to approach
{%Bhīṣma%} except {%Arjuna%} (with {%Kṛṣṇa%}) and {%Śikhaṇḍin%} (VI,
{@116@}). {%Bhīṣma%} did not defend himself against {%Śikhaṇḍin%},
whom {%Arjuna%} urged to quickly slay {%Bhīṣma%}, who with his
arrows only checked {%Arjuna%} and slew the {%Pāṇḍava%} warriors.
{%Duḥśāsana & Arjuna%} + all the {%Pārthas; Duḥśāsana%} was van-
quished by {%Arjuna%}; the {%Videhas%}, etc. (ρ) (urged by {%Duryo-%}
{%dhana%}) & {%Arjuna%}, who consumed them all by means of celestial
weapons; {%Arjuna & Duḥśāsana%}, etc. (σ), who fled (in the
forenoon); {%Bhīṣma%} (with a celestial weapon) {%& Arjuna%};
{%Śikhaṇḍin & Bhīṣma%}, who withdrew the celestial weapon
(VI, {@117@}). {%Śalya%}, etc. (τ), slaughtered the {%Pāṇḍava%} warriors;
{%Arjuna%} felled a great many {%Kurus. Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} sons & the
{%Pāṇḍavas%}; the {%Somakas%} and {%Sṛñjayas%} (urged by {%Dhṛṣṭa-%}
{%dyumna%}) & {%Bhīṣma%} (who relied on the instruction he had got
from {%Rāma%}); {%Bhīṣma%} slew 10,000 elephants, etc., and seven
{%Matsyas%} and {%Pāñcālas%}, and {%Śatānīka%} (the brother of {%Virāṭa%}),
etc. {%Kṛṣṇa%} urged {%Arjuna%} to slay {%Bhīṣma%}. The {%Pāñcāla%}
king and {%Dhṛṣṭaketu%}, etc. (υ), were afflicted by {%Bhīṣma%} and
rescued by {%Arjuna; Śikhaṇḍin%}, protected by {%Arjuna%}, rushed
against {%Bhīṣma; Arjuna%} slew all {%Bhīṣma's%} followers, and
then rushed at himself; {%Sātyaki%}, etc. (ϕ), attacked {%Bhīṣma%},
who slew seven warriors of {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna's%} division (VI, {@118@}).
Continuation: The extraordinary heroism of {%Bhīṣma%}: he
(disregarding the {%Pāñcāla%} king and {%Dhṛṣṭaketu%}) & {%Sātyaki%},
etc. (χ); {%Arjuna%} (with {%Śikhaṇḍin%} ahead) & {%Bhīṣma; Droṇa%},
etc. (ψ) (employing celestial weapons), & {%Arjuna; Sātyaki%},
etc. (ω), & the {%Kauravas%}, in order to rescue {%Arjuna; Arjuna%}
(with {%Śikhaṇḍin%}) & {%Bhīṣma%}, who (remembering the boon
granted by his father) now wished his death, which was
approved of by Ṛ. and V. (heard only by {%Bhīṣma%} and
{%Sañjaya%}), etc.; {%Bhīṣma%} said to {%Duḥśāsana%} that {%Arjuna%} was
[Page147-a+ 63]
invincible, and that he himself could not be vanquished by D.,
Dā., and Rā. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} urged his troops against {%Bhīṣma%};
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} sons surrounded {%Bhīṣma%}, but fled for {%Arjuna%};
the {%Sauvīras%}, etc. (αα), abandoned {%Bhīṣma%}. A little before
sunset {%Bhīṣma%} fell down from his chariot with his head to
the east; there were heard celestial voices, etc.; as the sun
was in the southern solstice, {%Bhīṣma%} postponed his death;
{%Gaṅgā%} sent to him the great Ṛ. in form of swans inhabiting
the {%Mānasa%} lake. The {%Kurus%}, headed by {%Kṛpa%} and {%Duryo-%}
{%dhana%}, sighed and wept; the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Sṛñjayas%}, etc. (ββ),
uttered loud shouts. Ṛ. and P. applauded {%Bhīṣma%}, who had
recourse to that {%Yoga%} which is taught in the great {%Upaniṣads%}
(VI, {@119@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, mentioning {%Bhīṣma's brahmacarya%}
for the sake of his father, and that he had not been slain by
{%Rāma Jāmadagnya%}, grieved that he had been slain by
{%Śikhaṇḍin. Sañjaya%} related that {%Bhīṣma%} lay on his bed of
arrows, without, however, touching the earth. Both the
{%Kurus%} ({%Karṇa, Duryodhana%}, etc.) and the {%Pāṇḍavas%} were
despondent; the welkin was enveloped with a gloom, etc.;
Ṛ., Si., and Cā. mentioned his {%brahmacarya%} for his father's
sake. The {%Pāṇḍavas%} blew their conches, and {%Bhīmasena%}
sported in great glee. {%Duḥśāsana%} informed {%Droṇa%}, who fell
down from his chariot, and then ordered the {%Kurus%} to desist
from battle; and so did the {%Pāṇḍavas%}. Then the kings of
both armies all repaired to {%Bhīṣma. Bhīṣma's%} head hanging
down, he asked a pillow; he refused the soft pillows offered
him, and asked {%Arjuna%} to give him a suitable pillow; {%Arjuna%}
supported his head with three arrows shot from the {%Gāṇḍīva%}
and inspired with {%mantras; Bhīṣma%} was highly gratified.
He caused {%Duryodhana%} to dismiss the physicians; he asked
that a ditch should be dug around him, until the sun should
proceed towards the direction occupied by {%Vaiśravaṇa%} (i.e.
the north), and told them to cease fighting. Stationing
guards all around for his protection, the heroes repaired for
rest in the evening. {%Kṛṣṇa%} congratulated {%Yudhiṣṭhira%},
“that canst slay with thy eyes alone”; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} ascribed
the victory to {%Kṛṣṇa%} (VI, {@120@}).—§ 588: THE ELEVENTH DAY:
After the night had passed away, maidens came to {%Bhīṣma%}
and showered flowers upon him. The {%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Kauravas%}
assembled together like brothers around his body. {%Bhīṣma%}
asked for water; he refused the excellent viands and water
offered him, and asked {%Arjuna%} to give him water; {%Arjuna%}
mounted his chariot, and from the {%Gāṇḍīva%} shot an arrow
inspired with {%mantras%} and identified with the {%Pārjanya%} weapon,
piercing therewith the earth, and there arose a jet of pure
and cold water; {%Bhīṣma%} praised {%Arjuna%}: “even {%Nārada%}
spoke of thee as an ancient Ṛṣi”; he mentioned his alliance
with {%Kṛṣṇa%}, and regretted that {%Duryodhana%} had not listened
to the words of {%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (α). He said to {%Duryodhana%} that
the weapons appertaining to {%Agni%}, etc. (β), were known only
to {%Arjuna%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%}, and told him to make peace, as long
as {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (γ), did not consume his troops; “let
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} go to {%Indraprastha.”%} But {%Duryodhana%} would
not accept his counsels (VI, {@121@}). All the kings retired.
{%Karṇa%} visited {%Bhīṣma%} in private. {%Bhīṣma%} told {%Karṇa%} that
he was not the son of {%Rādhā%}, but of {%Kuntī%}; that he knew
from {%Nārada%} and {%Vyāsa%}; “sinfully didst thou come into the
world; therefore it is that thy heart has been such, and also
because thou didst associate with the low”; he mentioned
that, proceeding to the city of {%Kāśi, Karṇa%} alone, with his
bow, had crushed the kings in battle in order to procure
a bride for the {%Kuru%} king; {%Jarāsandha%} could not become
a match to {%Karṇa%} in fight. He adjured {%Karṇa%} to unite
[Page147-b+ 63]
with his uterine brothers. {%Karṇa%} mentioned that {%Kuntī%} had
abandoned him, and his obligations to {%Duryodhana%}, etc. (δ);
he would fight {%Arjuna%} and the {%Pāṇḍavas%} though they were
protected by {%Kṛṣṇa. Bhīṣma%} gave permission to {%Karṇa%} to
fight, making heaven his goal, and then dismissed him
(VI, {@122@}).
