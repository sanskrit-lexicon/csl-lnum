{@Svargārohaṇika(ṃ) parva(n)@}¦ (“Bhīṣma's ascension
to Heaven”), the 92nd of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.
§ 10 (Pārvas.): I, {@2@}, 353.—§ 777. {%Vaiśampāyana%} said:
When {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} had taken leave of the citizens, etc., he
comforted the widows, whose husbands had been slain, with
[Page670-b+ 63]
abundant gifts, and being duly installed on the throne, he
reassured all his subjects [by acts of goodwill], etc. After
fifty days, seeing that the sun had begun its northern course,
he set out to see {%Bhīṣma%}, taking with him what was necessary
for the latter's cremation, accompanied by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%},
{%Gāndhārī, Kuntī%}, his brothers, {%Kṛṣṇa, Vidura, Yuyutsu%},
{%Yuyudhāna%}, and his other relatives and a great retinue, and
his priests. He beheld {%Bhīṣma%} surrounded by Ṛ {%Vyāsa%},
{%Nārada, Asita Devala%}, and by the remnant of unslain kings
from various parts of the country, guarded by the warriors
appointed for that duty; all the inhabitants of {%Kurujāṅgala%}
were also there. When {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} had told his errand,
{%Bhīṣma%} opened his eyes and saw all the {%Bharatas%} assembled.
He seized the hand of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and welcomed him; he
had now been lying there for fifty-eight nights, which he had
felt to be as long as a century; now it was the bright fort-
night of {%Māgha%}, and of this one-fourth had passed away.
Then he reminded {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} of the instructions he had
received from {%Vyāsa%}, and that he should regard the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
and especially {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} as his own sons. Then he praised
{%Kṛṣṇa%} as the Supreme God, and asked him to grant him
leave to die, and that he should ever protect the {%Pāṇḍavas%};
he complained that {%Duryodhana%} had never been willing to
follow his counsels; he said that he knew from {%Nārada%} and
{%Vyāsa%}, that {%Kṛṣṇa%} and {%Arjuna%} were Ṛ {%Nārāyaṇa%} and {%Nara%},
who had lived for a long time in {%Badarī. Kṛṣṇa%} then gave
{%Bhīṣma%} leave to die and come to the {%Vasus%}, comparing him
to {%Mārkaṇḍeya%}. Having given some few admonitions to
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, etc. (XIII, {@168@}), {%Bhīṣma%} successively caused
his life-breaths to leave his body, and the parts of his body
became successively free from wounds and arrows, at which
the bystanders became filled with wonder. His soul passed
through the crown of his head, ascended to heaven like a
meteor, and soon became invisible, while the celestial kettle-
drums began to play, a rain of flowers fell down, and Si.
and B-ṛ. applauded. Then the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, etc. (α) cremated
the corpse. Then, accompanied by Ṛ., etc. (β), they pro-
ceeded to {%Bhāgīrathī%} (Gaṅgā), where they offered oblations
of water to {%Bhīṣma%}. Then {%Bhāgīrathī%} appeared and, weeping,
praised {%Bhīṣma%} (γ). {%Kṛṣṇa%} comforted her, mentioning the
present felicity of {%Bhīṣma%} as one of the {%Vasus%}, and declared
that he had not been slain by {%Śikhaṇḍin%}, but by {%Arjuna%}.
{%Gaṅgā%} gave up her grief; all the kings, headed by {%Kṛṣṇa%},
obtained her permission to depart, and all returned [to the
city] (XIII, {@169@}).
