[{@Draupadī-sambhava(ḥ)@}]¦ (“origin of Draupadī”).
§ 218 (Caitrarathap.): Distressed and thinking of revenging
himself on {%Droṇa%}, not contented with his children and relatives,
king {%Drupada%} wandered along the {%Yamunā%} and the {%Gangā%} and
came to a hermitage of {%brahmans%}, and prevailed upon {%Yāja (b%})
to perform a sacrifice for him, assisted by his brother {%Upayāja%},
in order to obtain a son who might slay {%Droṇa%}. Then {%Yāja%}
summoned the queen ({%Pṛṣatī%}, v. 6390; {%Pārṣatī%}, v. 6405;
“daughter-in-law of {%Pṛṣata%},” PCR.), but she said that she
was not fit for accepting the offspring (?), her mouth being
unclean ({%avalipta%}) and her person perfumed. {%Yāja%} replied:
“Since the sacrifice has been prepared ({%śrapitaṃ%}) by {%Yāja%}
and sanctified by {%Upayāja's%} invocations ({%abhimantritaṃ%}), it
shall produce its effect whether thou comest or waitest.”
Then arose from the flames a boy with a crown on his head,
his body being arrayed in excellent armour, sword in hand
and carrying a bow and arrows, sending forth loud roars, and
immediately ascending a chariot. A great invisible being in
the skies said that he would destroy {%Droṇa%}, etc. After this
{%Pāñcālī%} arose from the centre of the {%vedī%}, and a voice, not
coming from a visible body, said that she would be the cause
of the destruction of many {%kṣatriyas%}. At the birth of
both children the {%Pāñcālas%} shouted with joy. The queen
was regarded as their mother. Then the {%brahmans%} gave to
the boy the name of {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, on account of his
audacity, etc. ({%dhṛṣṭatvād atidhṛṣṇutvād dyumnādyutsam-%}
{%bhavād api%}, v. 6406), and to the girl that of {%Kṛṣṇā%}, on
account of her dark complexion (v. 6407). {%Droṇa%} brought
{%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} to his own abode, and taught him the use
of all weapons, considering that destiny is inevitable (I, {@167@}).
