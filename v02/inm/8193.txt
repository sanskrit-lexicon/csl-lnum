parvans; cf. Parvasaṅgraha. § 8: Sauti related: Rāma
(Jāmadagnya), having in the intervals between the Tretā and
Dvāpara yugas repeatedly destroyed the warrior caste, formed
five lakes of blood at Samantapañcaka, where he offered
oblations of blood to the manes of his ancestors, until those
pacified him, and his lakes became holy {%tīrthas%} (places of
pilgrimage).—§ 9: Sauti explained the term {%akṣauhiṇī%} (an
army) and its subdivisions. Eighteen {%akṣauhiṇīs%} partook
of the battle; {%Bhīṣma%} holding the command for ten days,

between {%Bhīma%} and {%Duryodhana%} lasting half a day, and the
nightly assault of {%Drauṇi%} (i.e. {%Aśvatthāman%}), {%Hārdikya%} (i.e.
{%Kṛtavarman%}), and {%Gautama%} (i.e. {%Kṛpa%}) on {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%}
