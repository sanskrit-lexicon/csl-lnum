{@[Kīṭopākhyāna]@}¦ (“the episode relating to the worm”).
§ 762{%b%} (Ānuśāsanik.). {%Bhīṣma%} said: In days of old, when
the emancipated ({%Brahmabhūtaḥ%}) brahman {%Vyāsa%} roamed over
the world, he saw a worm speedily moving on a chariot-road.
Asked by {%Vyāsa%}, who was omniscient and knew the language
of every animal, the worm said that it was running away
from a large cart, lest it should be killed; every creature, in
whatever situation it may be placed, becomes attached to it;
“in even this order of being I am happy, I think, and wish
to live”; in his former life he was a cruel {%Śūdra%}, a usurer,
etc., never dedicating food to D. and P., etc. (description);
he now was filled with repentance and grief; he had, however,
worshipped his old mother, and once showed hospitality to
a brahman; in consequence thereof the memory had not
forsaken him, and he thought he should once more regain
happiness (XIII, {@117@}). {%Vyāsa%} said: “It is the consequence
of a meritorious act of mine that thou art not stupefied; in
consequence of my penances I am able to rescue a being of
demerit by the simply granting him sight of my person; there
is no stronger power than that of penances. Thou mayst
again attain to righteousness and merit; the state of a worm
is really fraught with great misery. The superior brahman
[Page409-b+ 63]
worships the Sun and the Moon uttering {%mantras%}; when thou
hast attained to that state, I shall impart to thee {%Bráhman%}.”
The worm remained and was killed by the cart. He was
reborn in diverse orders of being, such as a porcupine, Iguana,
boar, deer, bird, {%Cāṇḍāla, Śūdra%}, and {%Vaiśya%}. Born at last as
a {%Kṣatriya%} (with {%Kāmboja%} steeds, {%Sūtas%} and {%Māgadhas%}, etc.;
description) through the grace of {%Vyāsa%}, he came and
worshipped him. {%Vyāsa%} said that the sin of his former life
had yet not been destroyed; he should become a brahman by
giving up his life on the field of battle for the sake of cows
or brahmans; performing many sacrifices he should attain to
heaven, and after emancipation ({%Brahma-bhūtaḥ%}) he should
enjoy eternal happiness. The ascending order of transmigration
is: († v. 5774) animal {%> Śūdra > Vaiśya > Kṣatriya >%}
{%Brahman > Svarga%} (XIII, {@118@}). He betook himself to severe
austerities; {%Vyāsa%} went to him and said that the penances of
the {%Kṣatriyas%} consist in the protection of all creatures;
thereby he should attain to the state of a brahman. Then he
protected his subjects righteously, and after death became
a brahman. {%Vyāsa%} came and told him not to fear death, but
only the loss of righteousness. He caused the earth to be
marked with 100 sacrificial stakes, and then obtained a
residence in the region of {%Brahmán%} himself, and obtained the
eternal {%Bráhman%} by his own acts, according to the words
of {%Vyāsa%}. Also the {%Kṣatriyas%}, who have been slain [on the
field of Kurukṣetra], have attained to a meritorious end
({%gatiṃ puṇyāṃ%}); therefore, do not mourn on their account”
(XIII, {@119@}).
