[{@Suvarṇaṣṭhīvi-sambhavopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the
episode relating to the origin of Suvarṇaṣṭhīvin”). § 634{%b%}
(Rājadh.): {%Parvata%}, after having taken counsel with {%Nārada%},
granted a boon to {%Sṛñjaya%} in the form of a son ({%Suvarṇa-%}
{%ṣṭhīvin%}), but {%Indra%} would not let him be long-lived, and
{%Parvata%} would not destine otherwise from partiality to {%Indra%},
but {%Nārada%} told {%Sṛñjaya%} to think of him. {%Nārada%} and
{%Parvata%} left {%Sṛñjaya's%} presence. {%Indra%} slew {%Suvarṇaṣṭhīvin%},
causing his {%vajra%} to assume the form of a tiger, on the shores
of the {%Bhāgīrathī. Sṛñjaya%}, in his distress, thought of
{%Nārada%}, who recited to him the Ṣoḍaśarājop. (§ 632{%b%}), and
brought the child back to life, with {%Indra's%} permission;
{%Suvarṇaṣṭhīvin%} ruled for 1100 years, gratifying D. and P.,
and procreated many sons ere he died (XII, {@31@}).
