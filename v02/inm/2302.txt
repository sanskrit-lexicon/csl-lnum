[{@Śākulopākhyāna(ṃ)@}],¦ “the episode about the Śakula
fishes.” § 645{%b%} (Āpaddh.): In a lake that was not very
deep and which abounded in fishes, there lived three {%Śakula%}
fishes ({%kuśalās%} in B. seems only to be a typographical error)
that were friends; amongst those three, one had much fore-
thought ({%dīrghakālajñaḥ%}); another was possessed of great
presence of mind ({%utpannapratibhaḥ%}); the third was pro-
crastinating ({%dīrghasūtraḥ%}). One day certain fishermen
coming to that lake began to bale out its waters to a lower
ground through diverse outlets. He of great forethought,
having in vain warned the others, immediately set out
through a current and reached another deep lake. The
procrastinating one was caught with many others and tied to
a string. He of presence of mind thrust himself into the
company of those so tied, and remained quietly among them
biting the string, and escaped when the fishes were removed
to a piece of deep water to be washed. The procrastinating
one met with his death (XII, {@137@}).
