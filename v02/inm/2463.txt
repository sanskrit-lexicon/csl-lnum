Gotama had a son {%Śaradvat%}, born with arrows. {%Ś%}. studied
the {%Dhanurveda%} in preference to the {%Vedas%}, and by his
austerities he came to master all weapons. Indra was afraid
of him, and sent the {%devakanyā%} (cf. v. 5078: {%apsarasaṃ%})
Jānapadī to disturb him. He fled from her; but from his
seed that had fallen upon a clump of reeds ({%śarastambe%})
sprung two children, whom a soldier found and brought to
king {%Śāntanu. Śāntanu%}, from pity ({%kṛpā%}, v. 5089), brought
them up as his own children, whence he called them {%Kṛpa%} and
{%Kṛpī. Ś%}. by his {%tapas%} learnt what had happened and came
to {%Śāntanu%} and told him his lineage, etc. He then instructed
{%Kṛpa%} in the fourfold {%Dhanurveda%} and various {%śāstras%}, and in
[Page196-a+ 63]
a short time {%Kṛpa%} became an eminent teacher, who instructed
the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras, Pāṇḍavas, Yādavas, Vṛṣṇis%}, and other
princes from various countries in the {%Dhanurveda%}: I, {@130@},
