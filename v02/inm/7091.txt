{@Maṅkaṇaka@}<sup>2</sup>,¦ a ṛṣi. § 365 (cf. Tīrthayātrāp.): At the
tīrtha {%Saptasārasvata%} the great {%ṛṣi M%}. became perfect
({%siddhaḥ%}), so that when he had cut his hand with the pointed
blade of a {%kuśa%} grass, there flew from his wound vegetable
juice, at which he began to dance, and the animate and
inanimate creation also began to dance together with him.
Then the gods, headed by Brahman and the ṛṣis, asked
{%Mahādeva%} (i.e. Śiva) to prevent him from dancing. The god
then in the presence of {%M%}. pressed his thumb with the tip of
his own finger, and from the wound there came ashes, white
as snow. Then {%M%}. became ashamed and adored {%Rudra%}, saying
that he was the refuge of the world, including the gods and
the Asuras, that he had created the three worlds, and swallows
everything at the end of the {%yuga%}, that he cannot be fathomed
by the gods themselves, that all the gods headed by {%Brahmán%}
are to be seen in him, etc. At his request {%Śiva%} said to the
{%Brahmarṣi%} that his asceticism ({%tapas%}) should through the grace
of {%Śiva%} increase a thousandfold, that he would dwell with
him in the āśrama, and that those who bathe in {%Sapta-%}
{%sārasvata%} and worship {%Śiva%} should be able to obtain
everything here and hereafter, and go to the {%Sārasvata loka%};
then {%Mahādeva%} disappeared: III, {@83@}, 6086.—§ 615 (Bala-
devatīrthayātrā): IX, {@37@}, 2185 ({%siddhaḥ…mahāmuniḥ%},
had performed austerities at Saptasārasvata); {@38@}, 2186.—
§ 615{%j%} (do.): {%M%}. had from his youth led the life of a {%brahma-%}
{%cārin%}. Once, when performing his ablutions in the river
{%Sarasvatī%}, he beheld a woman bathing in the river; at this
sight his seed dropped and fell into the {%Sarasvatī%}; he took it
up and placed it in his earthen pot; then it became divided
into seven parts, whence were born seven {%ṛṣis: Vāyuvega%},
etc. (β), who were the progenitors of the {%Maruts%}. (Then
[Page465-a+ 63]
the same story as in § 365 is related.) {%M%}. was the son of
{%Mātariśvan%} and {%Sukanyā%}: IX, {@38@}, 2217, 2224, 2244.—
§ 615 (do.): IX, {@39@}, 2246. Cf. Brahmarṣi.
