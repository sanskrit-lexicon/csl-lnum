{@Subhūmika(ṃ)@},¦ a tīrtha on the Sarasvatī. § 615{%c%} (Bala-
devatīrthayātrā): In that tīrtha many Aps are sporting
(therefore it is called {%S%}.); D. and G. repair thither every
month; it is the resort of {%Brahmán%} himself; G. and diverse
tribes of Aps. are to be seen there, passing the time happily;
D. and P. sport there in joy, sacred flowers being strewn
over them; {%Baladeva%} heard the sound of those celestial
songs and musical instruments, and saw many shadows of
D., G., and Rā.; IX, {@37@}, 2121.
