{@Bhīmakadalīkhaṇḍapraveśa(ḥ)@}¦ (Bhīma's entering the
plantain thicket). § 424 (cf. Tīrthayātrāp.): There they dwelt
for six nights. Suddenly a wind from the north-east brought
a celestial lotus of 1,000 petals, which {%Kṛṣṇā%} presented to
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%}; she sent {%Bhīma%} to bring others, in order to
carry them to their hermitage in {%Kāmyaka. Bhīma%} proceeded
along the slopes of the {%Gandhamādana (b%}); the lions, etc.,
fled; invisible, the wives of {%Yakṣas%} and {%Gandharvas%} stared
at him. After having bathed in a lake, he blew his shell
and began to proceed into a plaintain wood, but was arrested
by his brother the ape {%Hanumat%}, who for his good obstructed
the way to heaven ({%divaṅgamaṃ mārgaṃ%}), saying that this
was the path to the {%devaloka%}, impassable by mortals, save
the way of {%siddhi (siddhigatiṃ%}) (III, {@146@}). {%Hanumat%} said
he was suffering from illness and could not rise; but {%Bhīma%}
would not leap over him, and could not remove his tail.—
§§ 425-430: {%Hanumad-Bhīma-saṃvāda%} (q.v.).
