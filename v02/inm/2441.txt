{@Śāntanūpākhyāna(ṃ)@}¦ (“episode relating to Śāntanu”).
§ 162 (Sambhav.): The {%rājarṣi Pratīpa%} spent many years in
ascetic penances at the source of {%Gaṅgā%}. She sat upon his
right thigh and wished him to be her husband. He replied
that the left lap was for the wife, but the right for the
daughters and daughters-in-law; therefore he accepted her
for his son, to which {%Gaṅgā%} consented on the condition that
his son should not be able to judge of the propriety of her
acts. Then {%Pratīpa%}, along with his wife, engaged in ascetic
austerities from desire of offspring, and when they had grown
old, {%Mahābhiṣa%} (v. Mahābhiṣop.) was born as a son to them
and was called {%Śāntanu%}, because his father had controlled
his passion ({%śāntasya santānaḥ%}, v. 3882, cf. 3799). When
{%Śāntanu%} had grown to become a youth, {%Pratīpa%} told him about
his appointment with the celestial damsel, installed him upon
the throne, and retired into the woods. {%Śāntanu%}, who was
addicted to hunting, one day came upon the banks of {%Gaṅgā%},
frequented by {%Siddhas%} and {%Cāraṇas%}, and there he requested
{%Gaṅgā%}, in the form of a lovely maiden, to become his wife
(I, {@97@}). (For continuation v. Bhīṣmotpatti.)
