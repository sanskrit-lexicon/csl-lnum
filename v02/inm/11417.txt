[{@Vaivasvatopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“story of Manu Vaiva-
svata”). § 457 (Mārk.). Requested by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%},
{%Mārkaṇḍeya%} said: The {%maharṣi Manu, Vivasvat's%} son, equal
to {%Prajāpati%} (i.e. {%Brahmán%}), excelled his father and grand-
father in strength, etc. He practised austerities in {%Badarī%},
standing on one foot, etc., for 10,000 years. Once a small
fish came to him on the banks of the {%Cīriṇī%} and asked his
protection from the greater fishes. He first reared it in a
water vessel, and as it grew larger, he carried it to a large
tank, and thence into the {%Gaṅgā%}, and at last into the ocean.
The fish, saying that the world was about to be destroyed,
caused him to build a strong ship with a long rope and
ascend it with the seven {%ṛṣis%} and the seeds that were
enumerated by the {%brahmans%} of old. The fish then appeared
and was recognized by a horn, to which {%Manu%} tied the noose.
And, while there was water everywhere, the fish dragged
the boat through the flood for many years, until, advised by
the fish, {%Manu%} tied the ship to the highest peak of {%Himavat%},
thence called {%Naubandhana%}. The fish told him that he was
{%Brahmán%}, and caused {%Manu%} to create (again) by austerities
all creatures with gods, {%Asuras%}, and men. This is the
{%Mātsyakaṃ Purāṇaṃ%} (III, {@187@}).
