[{@Bisastainyopākhyāna@}]¦ (“the episode relating to the
theft of the lotus-stalks”). § 750{%b%} (Ānuśāsanik.): {%Bhīṣma%}
[Page153-b+ 63]
said: The seven Ṛ. {%Kaśyapa%}, etc. (α), and {%Arundhatī%}
together had one single maidservant, {%Gaṇḍā%}, who was
married to the {%śūdra Paśusakha%}. While they, in days of old,
practised penances, preparing themselves for ({%upaśikṣanto%})
{%Brahmaloka%} by yoga meditation ({%samādhinā%}), there occurred
a severe drought; {%Śibi's%} son {%Śaibya%} had in former times
given away a son of his as the sacrificial present to
the {%ṛtvijes%}; that prince now died of starvation; impelled
by hunger, the {%Ṛṣis%} cooked his body in a vessel. King
{%Śaibya Vṛṣādarbhi%} came and offered to give them kine,
etc., but they refused it: that acceptance of gifts from a king
was poison; they left the spot abandoning that flesh. The
king sent his ministers with figs, some of which were filled
with gold; but {%Atri%}, finding them heavy, refused to take
them; and so did all of them (β), and left the spot. Filled
with wrath, {%Vṛṣādarbhi%}, after having observed penances,
poured libations into the fire accompanied by {%mantras%}; from
the fire a hag ({%kṛtyā%}) sprang forth, whom he called {%Yātudhānī%};
he ordered her to slay the {%Ṛṣis%}, etc., having ascertained
their names. While Ṛ. roved within the forest, subsisting
upon fruits and roots, they saw a well-nourished mendicant
[called further below {%Śunaḥsakha%}] with a dog in good
condition; {%Arundhatī%} pointed him out to them, and each of
them explained the superior condition of this mendicant with
reference to one of the points in which he was better situated
than they(γ). The wandering mendicant approached them
and touched their hand according to custom. One day they
beheld a beautiful lake overgrown with lotuses, and desired
to gather some lotus-stalks; urged by {%Vṛṣādarbhi, Yātu-%}
{%dhānī%}, who guarded the lake, would know their names before
they took the stalks; {%Atri%} knew that she stood there in
order to slay them; but they all told their names with their
etymological explanations (δ); at each explanation {%Yātudhānī%}
declared that she did not understand it, [in some cases] “in
consequence of the inflections which the roots had undergone”;
{%Śunaḥsakha%} calls himself {%Śunaḥsakha-sakhi%}, and as {%Yātudhānī%}
wishes to hear the name once more in order to understand
it, he struck her head with his triple stick, at which she
was consumed to ashes. Having gathered lotus-stalks, they
once more plunged into the lake in order to offer oblations
of water to the {%Pitṛs%}. As they came up, the stalks were
nowhere to be seen. They took, each of them, oaths to
their innocence(ε); but the oath of {%Śunaḥsakha%} was “no
oath at all,” and he confessed that he had stolen the stalks
from desire of testing them; he turned out to be {%Indra%}, who
had come to test them, and told them the whole matter
about {%Yātudhānī%}. They then ascended to heaven in the
company of {%Indra%} himself* (XIII, {@93@}).
