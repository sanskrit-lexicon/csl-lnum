[{@Strīvilāpaparvan(°va)@}]¦ (“the section containing the
lament of the women”, the 86th of the minor parvans of the
Mhbhr.; cf. Strīvilāpa). § 619: Aided by the spiritual
sight granted by {%Vyāsa, Gāndhārī%} beheld the field of
battle, though distant, from the spot where she stood
(description), with Rā., Pś., jackals, etc. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, at
the command of {%Vyāsa%}, with the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (headed by {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%}), with {%Kṛṣṇa%} and all the {%Kuru%} ladies, proceeded to
the field of battle. The {%Pāñcāla%} and the {%Kuru%} ladies were
plunged into unutterable distress (description), described by
the daughter of {%Subala%}, i.e. {%Gāndhārī%}, to {%Kṛṣṇa%}, mentioning
{%Bhīṣma%}, etc. (α); then her eyes fell upon {%Duryodhana%} (XI,
{@16@}). {%Gāndhārī's%} lament at the sight of {%Duryodhana%} (β)
(XI, {@17@}); do. of her sons and daughters-in-law, etc.,
especially {%Duḥśāsana%} (γ) (XI, {@18@}); do. of {%Vikarṇa%}, etc. (δ)
(XI, {@19@}); do. of {%Abhimanyu%}, etc., directing {%Kṛṣṇa's%} attention
to the laments of {%Uttarā%} (ε) (XI, {@20@}); do. of {%Karṇa%} (ζ)
(XI, {@21@}); do. of the lord of the {%Avantis%}, etc. (η), {%Jayadratha%},
and {%Duḥśalā%} (XI, {@22@}); do. of {%Śalya, Bhīṣma%}, etc., (θ) and
{%Droṇa%}, whose disciples, with {%Kṛpī%}, were burning his body on
the bank of the {%Gaṅgā%} (XI, {@23@}); do. of {%Somadatta%} and
{%Bhūriśravas%}, and the mother and wives of {%Bhūriśravas%}, and
{%Śakuni%} (ι) (XI, {@24@}); do. of the {%Kāmboja%}-king, etc. (κ).
Then {%Gāndhārī%} cursed {%Kṛṣṇa%} for not having prevented the
slaughter of the {%Kurus%} and the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, saying: “on
the thirty-sixth year from this thou shalt, after causing the
slaughter of thy kinsmen, etc., perish in a disgraceful way
within the wilderness, etc.” {%Kṛṣṇa%} said: “there is none
in the world, save myself, who is capable of exterminating
the {%Vṛṣṇis%}; I am endeavouring to bring it about; in
proclaiming this curse, thou hast aided me in the accomplish-
ment of that task” The {%Pāṇḍavas%} became stupefied
(XI, {@25@}).
