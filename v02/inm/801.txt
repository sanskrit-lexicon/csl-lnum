{@Arjuna@}<sup>2</sup>¦ Pāṇḍava. § 4 (Anukram.): I, {@1@}, 109, 123, 125,
127, 129, 149, 150, 152, 160, 162, 165, 169, 172, 178, 179,
184, 187, 190, 191, 193, 212.—§ 10 (Parvas.): I, {@2@}, 315,

438, 439, 459, 493, 505, 546, 622.—§ 71 (Bhāratasūtra): I,
{@61@}, 2267 ({%udīcīm%}, sc. {%ajayat%}), 2271, 2274.—§ 83 (Kṛṣṇā):
I, {@63@}, 2449 (his son with Subhadrā was Abhimanyu), 2451
(his son with Kṛṣṇā was Śrutakīrti).—§ 130 (Aṃśāvat.):
I, {@67@}, 2746 (son of Indra), 2748 ({%Abhimanyur Arjunasya%}
{%suto 'bhavat%}), 2751.—[§ 131 (do.): I, {@67@}, 2779 (for his sake
Indra asked Karṇa for his mail and earrings).]—§ 157
(Pūruv.): I, {@95@}, 3814 (son of Indra and Kuntī).—§ 159
(do.): I, {@95@}, 3827 (his son with Kṛṣṇā was Śrutakīrti),
3830 (his son with Subhadrā was Abhimanyu). After Pāṇḍu
had been cursed, that he should have no progeny, he caused
Dharma to procreate Yudhiṣṭhira in Kuntī, then Vāyu to
procreate Bhīmasena, and then Indra to procreate Arjuna.—
§ 190{%d%} (Pāṇḍavotp.): I, {@123@}: In order to propitiate {%Indra%}
(before summoning him), {%Pāṇḍu%}, took counsel with the
{%maharṣis%}, and caused {%Kuntī%} to observe an auspicious vow for
a full year, while he himself began to stand upon one leg, etc.
After the birth of {%A%}. a bodyless voice said that he should
subjugate the {%Madras%}, the {%Kurus%}, the {%Somakas%}, the {%Cedis%},
{%Kāśis%}, and {%Karūṣas%}, and satiate {%Havyavāhana%} (Fire) in the
{%Khāṇḍava%} wood with the fat of all beings, and, with his
brothers, perform three sacrifices; in battle he would gratify
{%Śaṅkara%}, and receive from him the {%Pāśupata%} weapon, and, at
the command of {%Indra%}, slay the {%Nivātakavacas%}, and acquire all
sorts of celestial weapons: 4791, 4795.—§ 191: On hearing
this voice, the ascetics dwelling on {%Śataśṛṅga%} became ex-
ceedingly glad. There was heard the sound of {%dundubhis%},
and flowers were showered down. The various tribes of
celestials ({%devagaṇāḥ%}), etc. (α), came there (enumeration,
among others, of {%Devagandharvas, Apsarases%}, the twelve
{%Ādityas%}, the {%Rudras%}, the {%Vainateyas%}). Then the Aśvins
procreated the twins Nakula and Sahadeva in Mādrī.—
§ 192 (Pāṇḍavotp.): I, {@124@}, 4854 (the third son of Kuntī).
Having been procreated on Śataśṛṅga in behalf of Pāṇḍu
by the gods Dharma (Yudhiṣṭhira), Vāyu (Bhīmasena),
Indra (Arjuna; the mother of these three was Kuntī), and
the Aśvins (Nakula and Sahadeva, who were twins and sons
of Mādrī) in Pāṇḍu's wives Kuntī and Mādrī, the five
Pāṇḍavas after the death of Pāṇḍu were brought to
Hāstinapura and educated by Droṇa, under the supervision
of Bhīṣma. Their cousins (the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra) hated
them, especially Duryodhana, who tried to murder Bhīmasena
and later on all the Pāṇḍavas and Kuntī (Mādrī had burnt
herself with the corpse of Pāṇḍu), and Karṇa hated Arjuna
from jealousy.—§ 203{%b%} (cf. Droṇa): I, {@132@}: One day
{%Droṇa%} asked his pupils to promise to accomplish what
he had on his heart; only {%Arjuna%} promised it. {%Arjuna%}
became the foremost of all his fellow-pupils. {%Droṇa%} gave
every one of his pupils a narrow-mouthed vessel ({%kamaṇḍalu%})
for fetching water, in order that much time might be spent
in filling it, but to {%Aśvatthāman%} he gave a broad-mouthed
vessel ({%kumbha%}), and in the intervals so gained he used to
instruct his son in several superior methods; but {%Arjuna%}
filled the vessel by means of the {%Vāruṇa%} weapon, and used
[Page069-a+ 63]
to come at the same time as {%Aśvatthāman. Droṇa%} told the
cook never to give {%Arjuna%} his food in the dark, but not to
tell him that it was he ({%Droṇa%}) that had ordered this. One
day a wind put the lamp out when {%Arjuna%} was taking his
food; but his hand went up to his mouth from habit. His
attention being thus called to the force of habit, {%Arjuna%}
practised with his bow in the night, and {%Droṇa%} promised him
that there should not be a bowman equal to him in the world.
He taught him also to fight on horseback, etc., with the
mace, etc.: 5217, 5218, 5224, 5225, 5230, 5232, 5233,
5238.—§ 204 (Ekalavya): I, {@132@}, 5252 (Droṇa took from
Ekalavya as his fee the thumb of his right hand in order that
he might not surpass Arjuna).—§ 205{%e%} (cf. Droṇa): I, {@132@},
5273, 5274: Arjuna excelled everyone in every respect, and
alone became an {%atiratha%} (“a charioteer capable of fighting
at one time with 60,000 foes,” PCR.).—§ 206 (Droṇa): I,
{@132@}{%f%}, 5293, 5296. One day Droṇa caused an artificial bird
to be placed on the top of a tree, and first repeatedly asked
Yudhiṣṭhira to tell what he did see, while aiming at the
bird. He answered that he saw the tree, Droṇa, his
brothers, and the bird. Droṇa reproachfully told him to
stand apart. Then Droṇa repeated the experiment with his
other pupils, with the same result (ch. {@132@}). At last
Arjuna's turn came; he said first that he saw only the
vulture, and then that he saw only its head, and, when
Droṇa gave the order, he struck off its head with his shaft
(I, {@133@}).—§ 207 (do.): I, {@133@}: Arjuna rescued the life
of Droṇa by shooting with five arrows an alligator in the
Gaṅgā that had seized his thigh. Droṇa gave him the
weapon Brahmaśiras on the condition that he should not use
it against a human foe, as it might burn the whole universe.
—§ 208{%b%} (cf. Astradarśana): I, {@135@}: Then {%Arjuna%} appeared,
while {%Kuntī%} wept with joy, and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} learned from
{%Vidura%} who it was. By the {%Āgneya%} weapon {%Arjuna%} created
fire, by the {%Vāruṇa%} water, by the {%Vāyavya%} air, by the {%Pārjanya%}
clouds; by means of the {%Pārvata%} a mountain came into
being (v. 5366, read with V. {%“abhavadgiriḥ”%} or with B.
{%“asṛjadgirīn”%}), and by the {%Antardhāna%} weapon it again
disappeared, etc.; he at one time shot five shafts together
into the mouth of a moving iron boar, and discharged
twenty-one arrows into the hollow of a cow's horn hung up
in a rope and swaying to and fro (v. 5370, instead of {%“bale”%}
read with B. and V. {%“cale”%}).—§ 208 (Astradarśana): I, {@137@},
5440, 5442: At the show of arms Karṇa in vain challenged
Arjuna.—§ 209 (Drupadaśāsana): I, {@138@}, 5484, 5492,
5499, 5500, 5501. Arjuna helped Droṇa to subjugate
Drupada, which favour Droṇa had asked as his fee.—
§ 210{%c%} (cf. Sambhavaparvan): I, {@139@}: {%Droṇa%} taught {%Arjuna%}
Brahmaśiras (that he had learnt from {%Agniveśa%}, the disciple
of {%Agastya%}), on the condition that he should not hurl
it at any human being (cf. § 207), and obtained from
him as his fee the promise that he would fight with him
[in the great battle]. Then {%Arjuna%} went away to the
northern region.—§ 211 (Sambhavap.): I, {@139@}, 5537, 5538.
Headed by Arjuna, the Pāṇḍavas in war slew Sauvīra, who
had performed a three years' sacrifice at the inroad of the
Gandharvas. The Yavana king, whom even Pāṇḍu had
failed to subject, was subdued by Arjuna; as was also the
Sauvīra Vitula (B. {%Vipula%}), who had always shown a dis-
regard for the Kurus; and the Sauvīra Sumitra, called
Dattāmitra (LIA. i, pp. 656/804, n. 2); assisted by Bhīma,
Arjuna with only a single chariot subjugated all the kings of
the east ({%prācyāḥ%}) backed by 10,000 chariots; and in the
[Page069-b+ 63]
same way the south. Dhṛtarāṣṭra's sentiments towards the
Pāṇḍavas suddenly became poisoned, and from anxiety he
could not sleep (I, {@139@}).—§ 213 (Jatugṛhap.): I, {@151@},
5911 (has escaped from the lac house).—§ 214 (Hiḍimbav.):
I, {@154@}, 6019, (6027), (6034), 6039 ({%A%}. offered to assist
Bhīmasena against Hiḍimba, and exhorted him to kill him
without delay; then he caused the Pāṇḍavas to proceed to
a town not far off); {@156@}, 6096.—§ 217 (Caitrarathap.):
I, {@166@}, 6346 (a brahman related how Bhīṣma prevailed upon
Droṇa to teach the princes, etc.; both Arjuna and the others
promised to do whatever he might ask as his fee, etc.).—
§ 219 (do.): I, {@168@}, 6419 (the brothers set out for the town
of Drupada).—§ 221 (do.): I, {@170@}, (6451), (6462), (6472),
6474, (6493), 6499 (while the Pāṇḍavas were wandering
from Ekacakrā to the town of the Pāñcālas, Arjuna walking
before them torch in hand, the Gandharva king Citraratha
opposed them at the Gaṅgā, but was vanquished by Arjuna,
whom he then gave the Gandharvic māyā called Cākṣuṣī,
and on whom and each of his brothers he bestowed 100
Gandharva horses; he gave them the counsel to select a fit
purohita; Arjuna in return gave him the Āgneya weapon).—
§ 222 (Tapatyup.): I, {@171@}, (6516) (as Citraratha had called
{%A%}. Tāpatya, Arjuna caused him to relate Tapaty-upākhyāna).
{@173@}, 6633 (“their son was Kuru, the ancestor of Arjuna”).
—§ 223 (Vāsiṣṭha): I, {@174@}, 6634 (Citraratha told Arjuna
about Vasiṣṭha). {@175@}, (6649), 6659 (Citraratha related the
hostilities between Viśvāmitra and Vasiṣṭha to Arjuna).—
§ 229 (Vasiṣṭhop.): I, {@182@}, (6888) (asked by Arjuna,
Citraratha related why Kalmāṣapāda commanded his queen
to go to Vasiṣṭha, etc.).—§ 230 (Dhaumyapuroh.): I, {@183@},
(6913), 6915 (according to the counsel of Cītraratha, the
Pāṇḍavas installed Dhaumya as their purohita, and resolved
to go to the svayaṃvara of Kṛṣṇā).—§ 231 (Svayaṃvarap.):
I, {@184@}: The Pāṇḍavas went to the Pāñcāla land in the
company of brahmans who told them of the svayaṃvara,
etc.). {@185@}: On their way they beheld Vyāsa; they took
up their quarters in the house of a potter; and adopting the
brahmanical profession, they began to lead an eleemosynary
life. Drupada always wished to bestow his daughter on
Kirīṭin (i.e. Arjuna), and therefore caused a very stiff bow
to be made which was incapable of being bent by anybody
except Arjuna.—§ 233 (do.): I, {@187@}: When Duryodhana,
etc., had in vain tried to string the bow, and Karṇa, though
having succeeded in stringing it, had as a sūta, been rejected
by Kṛṣṇā, Jiṣṇu (i.e. Arjuna) came forward. {@188@}, 7049,
7051, 7052: Some of the brahmans spoke reproachingly of
Arjuna's daring undertaking, some approved of it. Bending
his head unto Īśāna and remembering Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna
accomplished the task; Kṛṣṇā approached Arjuna, who soon
after left the lists, followed by her.—§ 234 (do.): I, {@189@},
7075, 7080: When Drupada expressed his desire of bestowing
his daughter on that brahman the kings resolved to slay
Drupada and burn Kṛṣṇā, but spare Arjuna, whom they
took for a brahman; Arjuna and Bhīmasena rescued them;
Kṛṣṇa knew the Pāṇḍavas. {@190@}, 7086, 7094, 7098, 7099:
Karṇa is defeated by Arjuna (“accomplished in the Brāhma
and the Paurandara weapons,” v. 7105), etc. Bhīmasena
and Arjuna with difficulty escaped from the throng, followed
by Kṛṣṇā.—§ 235 (do.): I, {@191@}, (7138), 7141: When they
came with Kṛṣṇā, Kuntī said “enjoy ye all”; Yudhiṣṭhira
declared that Arjuna should wed her, but agreed that she
should be the common wife of them all.—§ 236 (do.): I,
{@192@}: Dhṛṣṭadyumna secretly followed Bhīmasena and
[Page070-a+ 63]
Arjuna, and from their conversation learned who they were.—
§ 237 (Vaivāhikap.): I, {@193@}, 7192: Dhṛṣṭadyumna related
what had happened; Arjuna is said to have large red eyes
(v. 7175); from their conversation he concluded that they
were the Pāṇḍavas of whom it had been heard that they had
all escaped from the house of lac. {@195@}, 7226, 7235, 7237:
Drupada vowed to restore Yudhiṣṭhira on his paternal throne;
he became very perplexed at the project of marrying Kṛṣṇā
to all the five brothers; meanwhile Vyāsa arrived.—§ 241
(Vidurāgam.): I, {@200@}, 7367: Vidura and Dhṛtarāṣṭra
became glad at the Pāṇḍavas having won Kṛṣṇā; but
Duryodhana and Karṇa tried to stir Dhṛtarāṣṭra up against
them. {@201@}, 7408: Duryodhana proposed several means of
getting the better of the Pāṇḍavas, etc.—§ 244 (Rājyalā-
bhap.): I, {@207@}, 7547: Dhṛtarāṣṭra caused the Pāṇḍavas
together with Kuntī and Kṛṣṇā to repair to Khāṇḍavaprastha
(Indraprastha), giving them half the kingdom.—§ 247
(Arjunavanavāsap.): I, {@213@}, (7774): The Pāṇḍavas reigned
in prosperity at Indraprastha; once Arjuna, having violated
an established rule regarding Kṛṣṇā, set out to live twelve
years in the forest.—§ 248 (do.): I, {@214@}, (7796), 7804:
Arjuna was drawn away to the bottom of the water by Ulūpī
(upon whom he begat a son); she said that he would be
invincible in water.—§ 249 (do.): I, {@215@}: {%A%}. visited many
tīrthas, married Citrāṅgādā at Maṇipūra, where he dwelled
for three years; she gave birth to a son.—§ 250 (do.):
I, {@216@}{%f%}, 7850: {%A%}. visited the tīrthas of the southern ocean,

(Haraṇāharaṇap.): I, {@221@}, 7969, 7987, 8032, 8039, 8048:
Kṛṣṇa reconciled {%A%}. with the Bhojas, etc.; {%A%}. married
Subhadrā and passed a whole year at Dvārakā; then Kṛṣṇa
remained for some time with {%A%}. at Indraprastha; Subhadrā
brought forth Abhimanyu, who became the favourite of
Kṛṣṇa and from his father acquired the Dhanurveda.
Kṛṣṇā also obtained five sons (Śrutakarman by Arjuna),
who, after having studied the Vedas, from Arjuna acquired
knowledge of all weapons celestial and human.—§§ 254—260
(Khāṇḍavadah.): I, {@222—234: 224@}, 8161, 8167; {@225@},
8201, (8203); {@227@}, 8238, 8245, 8247, 8275, 8278, 8282;
{@228@}, 8298, 8301, 8308, 8309, 8310, 8312, 8317, 8322,
8326; {@234@}, 8466, 8476, 8478: Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna assisted
Agni in burning the Khāṇḍava forest; Agni caused Varuṇa
to give Arjuna the Gāṇḍīva bow, two inexhaustible quivers,
and a car yoked with horses; then Agni gave Kṛṣṇa the
discus Sudarśana; Varuṇa gave Kṛṣṇa the mace Kaumodakī;
Indra in vain poured down showers of rain in order to prevent
the burning. An incorporeal voice said that Kṛṣṇa and
Arjuna, being really the old ṛṣis and gods Nara and
Nārāyaṇa, were invincible. Indra appeared and promised
to give Arjuna all his weapons (both the Āgneya and the
Vāyavya), when Mahādeva had been pleased by him; he
granted Kṛṣṇa that his friendship with Arjuna should
be eternal. The car (I, 8183 ff.) which Varuṇa gave
to Arjuna was furnished with celestial weapons, etc., and
incapable of being vanquished by gods or Asuras; its banner
bore a large monkey; the car was drawn by horses white as
silver, born in the region of the Gandharvas ({%Gāndharvaiḥ%}),
and harnessed with gold, and in speed resembling the wind
or the mind; its splendour was great, and the sound of
its wheels was tremendous; it had been created by the
[Page070-b+ 63]
Prajāpati Bhaumana (Viśvakarman) after severe ascetic
meditation; no one could gaze at its splendour; it was the
very car riding upon which Soma had vanquished the
Dānavas; it was furnished with an excellent flagstaff of
golden colour, upon which was seen a celestial ape apparently
bent upon burning everything it beheld; and upon the flags
were seen various creatures of large size whose roars and yells
caused the enemy's soldiers to faint.—§ 261 (Sabhākriyāp.):
II, {@1@}, (3), (6): Maya asked Arjuna to tell him what he was
to do for him because he had been rescued by him in the
Khāṇḍava forest; Arjuna told him to do something for
Kṛṣṇa, who causes him to build a palace for Yudhiṣṭhira.

971: The combat between Bhīma and Jarāsandha having
lasted for thirteen days, Bhīma killed him on the fourteenth
night; they installed Jarāsandha's son Sahadeva as king of
Magadha, then they returned to Indraprastha on Jarāsandha's
celestial car; Kṛṣṇa set out for Dvārakā.—§ 278 (Digvijap.):
II, {@25@}, (984): Having obtained the bow, {%A.%}, etc., prevailed
upon Yudhiṣṭhira to let him subdue the north; {%A%}. set out
on that celestial car which he had obtained from Agni and
subdued the north, while his brothers subdued the other
regions, and Yudhiṣṭhira stayed at Indraprastha.—§ 279 (cf.
Digvijayaparvan): {%Arjuna%} subdued the {%Kulindas, Ānarttas%},
{%Kālakūtas, Sumaṇḍala%}, and with him {%Śākala-dvīpa%} and king
{%Prativindhya%} and the kings in {%Śākala-dvīpa%} and the Seven
Islands ({%Saptadvīpeṣu%}, i.e. the Earth), and together with
them he vanquished {%Bhagadatta%}, king of {%Prāgjyotiṣa%} and
friend of {%Indra%}, who was surrounded by {%Kirātas, Cīnas%},
and other warriors dwelling on the sea-coast; after eight
days of combat, {%Arjuna%} prevailed upon him to give tribute
to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} at his will (II, {@26@}), 999, (1007). Having
vanquished all the mountain kings of the north, he subdued
{%Bṛhanta%}, the mountain king dwelling in {%Ulūka%}, and with
him {%Senāvindu%}; at the command of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, he stayed
at {%Devaprastha%}, the city of {%Senāvindu%}, while his troops
subjugated {%Modāpura, Vāmadeva, Sudāman, Susaṅkula%}, and
the {%Northern Ulūkas%}. Then, having vanquished the moun-
taineers, he conquered the town of the {%Paurava%} king
{%Viśvagaśva%}; then the seven tribes of the {%Utsavasaṅketas%},
etc. Having conquered the {%Himavat%} and {%Niṣkuṭa%} (? see

{%Śvetaparvata%}, he subdued the country of the {%Kimpuruṣas%}
ruled by {%Drumaputra%}, then by conciliatory proceedings the
country named {%Hāṭaka%} defended by {%Guhyakas%}. Then he came
to the {%Mānasa%} lake and all the sacred waters ({%ṛṣikulyāh%}).
[Page071-a+ 63]
Then he conquered the region of the {%Gandharvas%}, and took
as tribute from the {%Gandharva%} city horses spotted as partridges
and named {%maṇḍūkas%} (‘frogs’). At the entrance to {%Northern%}
{%Harivarṣa%} he was encountered by huge guardians ({%dvāra-%}
{%pālāḥ%}), who told him that this city could not be conquered,
that he who entered it was sure to perish, that nothing might
be seen there by one with a human body, for this was the
abode of the {%Northern Kurus%}, but that they would do any-
thing else he would ask of them. At his request they gave
him heavenly clothes, etc., as a tribute for {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}.
Then he returned to {%Indraprastha%}, and gave all he had won to
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (II, {@28@}), 1048, 1051.—§ 286 (Rājasūyikap.):
II, {@33@}, 1221, 1234: Under Yudhiṣṭhira's rule the people

(Śiśupālav.): II, {@42@}, 1475: In the quarrel between Kṛṣṇa,
etc., and Śiśupāla on the occasion of the handing over of
the gift of honour (Arghāharaṇap.), in which Śiśupāla was
ultimately killed by Kṛṣṇa, Śiśupāla also spoke with
depreciation about Arjuna's, etc., slaying Jarāsandha.—
[§ 292{%a%} (Rājasūyikap.): II, {@45@}α, 1607 (Dhanañjaya, i.e.
Arjuna, followed Yajñasena, i.e. Drupada).]—§ 293 (Dyūtap.):
II, {@46@}, 1640: Terrible omens had appeared at the rājasūya,
which Vyāsa explained as foreboding the destruction of the
kṣattriyas after thirteen years by Bhīma, {%A.%}, etc.; {%A%}.

—§ 294 (do.): II, {@47@} ff., 1670, 1755: Bhīma, Arjuna, etc.,
laughed at Duryodhana's mistakes in the palace; Śakuni
caused him to invite the Pāṇḍavas to a match of dice.—

dhana said that if Bhīma, Arjuna, and the twins would
declare that Yudhiṣṭhira was not their master, then Draupadī
would be free; {%A%}. said that he was certainly their master

Aindra, Pāśupata, Brāhmya, Pārameṣṭhya, likewise those of
Prajāpati, Yama, Dhātṛ, Savitṛ, Tvaṣtṛ, and Vaiśravaṇa,

now conquer him; he had received fifteen weapons and learnt
five ways of using them; Indra had asked him as his fee to
slay the Nivātakavacas, and had given him the car (conducted
by Mātali) upon which he (Indra) had vanquished Bali, etc.,
and “this” diadem and ornaments of his own and the
impenetrable mail, and he had fastened “this” durable

(cf. § 446).—§ 444 (do.): III, {@169@} f., 12173, 12181:
Arjuna related his victory over the Nivātakavacas; Indra
had formerly been told by Svayambhū that he himself would
destroy them in another body; as the gods were unable to
slay them, Indra had presented those weapons to Arjuna in
order to have them killed. Then Arjuna and Mātali again
went to the abode of the gods.—§ 445 (do.): III, {@173@}:
While returning, {%A%}. destroyed Hiraṇyapura, inhabited by
Paulomas and Kālakhañjas, who could not be slain even by
the gods, etc.; therefore Brahmán had determined that
Arjuna, a mortal, should kill them; he employed the Raudra

{@175@}, 12292, 12309: The next morning, when Arjuna
was about to show the celestial weapons to Yudhiṣṭhira,
the earth trembled, etc. Vāyu laid celestial garlands on

necessity, which would destroy the three worlds; then the
gods departed.—§ 448 (Ājagarap.): III, {@176@}, 12317: The

Pāṇḍavas were dwelling at the lake [of Dvaitavana],

vailed upon Arjuna to rescue Duryodhana, he being himself
prohibited by a sacrifice. {@244@}: As the Gandharvas would
not set free Duryodhana, etc., as requested by Arjuna,

15004, 15005: The Gandharvas in vain attempted to break
the cars of the Pāṇḍavas; especially Arjuna sent millions
of them to the abode of Yama by means of his Āgneya
weapon. The Gandharvas then rose up to the skies, taking
the Dhārtarāṣṭras with them, showering maces, darts, etc.,
upon Arjuna, who killed them with his weapons Sthūṇākarṇa
(C. Sthūlā°), Indrajāla, Saura, Āgneya, and Saumya. At
last Citrasena rushed at Arjuna, armed with a mace of iron;
when Arjuna had cut that mace into seven pieces with his
arrows, Citrasena, by means of his science, concealed himself
from the view of Arjuna, and thus continued to fight with
him; but Arjuna destroyed his power of concealing himself by
shooting at him with his celestial arms, guided by the sound
({%śabdavedhaṃ samāśritya%}). Then Citrasena showed himself
to Arjuna, reminding him that he was his friend, and the
battle was interrupted. {@246@}, 15010: Citrasena relates that
he had been acquainted with the purpose of Duryodhana,
etc., and had been requested by Indra to bring Duryodhana

the Kauravas. {@249@}, 15070: Duryodhana renounced all food

protected by Kṛṣṇa. The Pāṇḍavas continued to dwell in
Kāmyaka.—§ 546 (Kuṇḍalāharaṇap.): III, {@300@} ff.: Lomaśa
had conveyed a message from Indra to Yudhiṣṭhira: “That
intense fear of thine which thou dost never express to

Arjuna praised Yudhiṣṭhira before Virāṭa, and showed him
all the Pāṇḍavas; Uttara spoke about Arjuna's prowess,
and described each of the Pāṇḍavas, especially Arjuna (“it
was by him that Bhīṣma, Droṇa, and Duryodhana were
vanquished”). Virāṭa offered to bestow his daughter Uttarā
upon Arjuna, who accepted her for Abhimanyu. The nuptial
festival was held at Upaplavya, where a great many kings
came with akṣauhiṇīs of troops.—§ 554 (Sainyodyogap.):

took counsel of each other about the preparations of war;
after Kṛṣṇa had set out for Dvārakā, Arjuna and
Duryodhana came thither while Kṛṣṇa was asleep; Arjuna
chose Kṛṣṇa himself, who was not to fight, and Kṛṣṇa
promised to become Arjuna's charioteer; Arjuna came back
to Yudhiṣṭhira with Kṛṣṇa and the foremost Daśārhas.

Dhṛtarāṣṭra sent Sañjaya to Upaplavya, where he saluted

in the council hall related that Arjuna (! cf. § 556, V, {@23-@}
{@28@}) had said with Yudhiṣṭhira's sanction that Sañjaya
should threaten Duryodhana, etc., saying that the Pāṇḍavas
only wished for war; Arjuna said (§ 561{%b%}, V, {@48@}) that one
morning when he had finished his water rites and prayers,
a brahman said to him that he would have to fight with his
foes, and that either Indra riding on his steed would walk
before him, or Kṛṣṇa would protect him from behind riding
on his car drawn by Sugrīva; and Arjuna had preferred
Vāsudeva (Kṛṣṇa) as his ally to Indra. Arjuna also
said that Duryodhana thought of imprisoning Kṛṣṇa and
seeks to create a sudden disunion between Kṛṣṇa and
Arjuna, and relates terrific omens; “I will hurl the Sthūṇā-
karṇa, Pāśupata, and Brāhma weapons, and all those that
Śakra gave me.” Bhīṣma said that Nara and Nārāyaṇa are
Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa; Arjuna with an arrow severed in battle
the head of the Asura Jambha, etc., and Bhīṣma rebuked
Karṇa, who had seen his brother in the city of Virāṭa slain by
Arjuna; Sañjaya mentioned Arjuna's burning of the Khāṇḍava
forest. Dhṛtarāṣṭra was most afraid of Bhīma (who in height
is higher than Arjuna by the span of the thumb); yet he was
also afraid of Arjuna; “33 years have passed away since the
burning of the Khāṇḍava forest; we have never heard of
his being defeated anywhere”; Duryodhana alluded to the
resolution of the Saṃśaptakas to slay Arjuna.—§ 561{%h%} (Yānas.):

{%Dhātṛ%} (i.e. Prajāpati, Nīl.); for on this (i.e. Arjuna's) flagstaff
they (i.e. Tvaṣṭṛ, Śakra, and Dhātṛ, Nīl.) have made forms

in all directions both perpendicularly and laterally covered one

be impeded; it was ever varying like {%Śakra's%} bow (i.e. the
rainbow). And to that chariot were yoked 100 white celestial
steeds with the speed of the winds, given by {%Citraratha%};
neither on earth, nor in the sky, nor in heaven, their course
could be impeded; a boon had been granted that their number
would always remain full, however often they might be slain.
—Arjuna had got Karṇa, Jayadratha, etc., assigned as his
share in the combat. Arjuna was protected by the celestials;
Sañjaya had seen two straight lines on his foot soles; Agni
would help him as in Khāṇḍava; he took up 500 arrows at
a time, and Kṛṣṇa protected him; on a single chariot Arjuna
conquered the whole earth, etc.; he had said that Bhīṣma,
etc., were all on the eve of death, if they did not give up
to Yudhiṣṭhira his own share of the kingdom.—§ 562

Bhīma and Arjuna, like two Yamas, were capable of slaying

of the exploits of {%A.%}; Droṇa said that his affection for {%A%}. was
greater than for Aśvatthāman. Duryodhana had chosen Karṇa
as the antagonist of Arjuna. Kṛṣṇa described Arjuna's
banner, made by Bhaumana by means of celestial illusion;
his Aindra, Āgneya, and Māruta weapons, etc. Karṇa

Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, all of them blowing their conchs on
entering Kurukṣetra. As Yudhiṣṭhira complained that he
had to slay his preceptors, etc., {%A%}. reminded him of what
Kuntī and Vidura had said through Kṛṣṇa. Bhīṣma said
that he did not know of any warrior upon earth who was equal
to him, except Arjuna; but Arjuna would never openly fight
with him. Karṇa wanted to fight with Arjuna, but not before
Bhīṣma was slain. Arjuna “of curly hair” was made the
leader of all the leaders of the Pāṇḍava army, and Kṛṣṇa
the leader of Arjuna and the driver of his steeds. Bhīṣmaka's
son Rukmin offered Arjuna his assistance if he was afraid;
{%A.%}, mentioning his exploits, and that he had paid his homage

said that with Kṛṣṇa as his ally he might exterminate the
three worlds with the gods, etc., in the twinkling of an eye,

a hymn to Dūrgā, who appeared and gave him assurance of

two armies, so that he might see who had assembled to fight.
Beholding his relatives, etc., Arjuna was filled with compassion
and overcome with despondency, and refused to fight. Kṛṣṇa
appeals to Arjuna to shake off his despondency, but in vain.
Kṛṣṇa then explained to Arjuna the nature and the attributes

him to fulfil the duties of his caste by fighting like a man, and
to concern himself with work for work's sake and not for

weapons), fought with {%A.%}; Bhīṣma said to Duḥśāsana that
{%A%}. was invincible, and that he himself was not able to be
vanquished by D., Dā., and Rā.; Dhṛtarāṣṭra's sons
surrounded Bhīṣma, but fled before Arjuna. Bhīṣma fell
down from his chariot a little before sunset, but put off his
death, as the sun was in the southern solstice; both parties
desisted from battle; as Bhīṣma's head hung down he asked
for a pillow; Arjuna supported his head with three arrows shot
from the Gāṇḍīva and consecrated by means of mantras, at
which Bhīma was highly gratified.—§ 588 (do.), VI, {@121—122@}:
ELEVENTH DAY: {@121@}, 5776, 5780, 5781: The next morning,
as Bhīṣma asked for water, Arjuna mounted his chariot
and from the Gāṇḍīva shot an arrow consecrated with mantras
and identified with the Pārjanya weapon, therewith piercing
the earth, and there arose a jet of pure and cold water;
Bhīṣma praised Arjuna: “even Nārada spoke of thee as an
ancient ṛṣi…”; he said to Duryodhana that the
weapons appertaining to Agni, etc., were known only to
Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa. Bhīṣma tried to win over Karṇa to
the side of his uterine brothers, but he said that he would
fight Arjuna, etc., though protected by Kṛṣṇa.—§ 589

Bhīṣma, mentioning the danger menacing the Kurus from
Arjuna with the Gāṇḍīva, etc., Arjuna's battle with Śiva, etc.
Yudhiṣṭhira disposed his troops in the form of a krauñca
(crane), with Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna at the head. The Pāṇḍavas
[Page077-a+ 63]
and Sṛñjaya were defeated by Droṇa; Yudhiṣṭhira asked {%A%}.
to check Droṇa. Dhṛtarāṣṭra regretted that Duryodhana did
not know Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna.—§ 590 (do.), VII, {@12—16@}:
ELEVENTH DAY (Sañjaya begins his narrative in detail): {@12@},
453; {@13@}, (472): Droṇa promised to seize Yudhiṣṭhira, if
he was not protected by Arjuna (with his weapons received
from Indra and Rudra, etc.); Arjuna must therefore be with-
drawn from Yudhiṣṭhira. Yudhiṣṭhira learnt through his
spies that Droṇa had promised to seize him; {%A%}. consoled him.
A fierce battle commenced; protected by Droṇa and Arjuna,
both hosts seemed to stand inactive. In order to rescue
Yudhiṣṭhira, {%A%}. attacked Droṇa's division. When the sun
set, both parties withdrew their troops. The Pāṇḍavas, etc.,
praised Arjuna.—§ 591 (Saṃśaptakavadhap.), VII, {@17@}, 680,
688, 709: Droṇa confessed his inability of seizing Yudhiṣṭhira
if Arjuna were by; the Trigarta king, saying that Arjuna had
always injured them, said that they would take an oath that
either Arjuna or the Trigartas should be slain. Then they
summoned Arjuna to the southern part of the field. Arjuna
told Satyajit to guard Yudhiṣṭhira, and went out against
the Trigartas.—§ 592 (do.), VII, {@18—32@}: TWELFTH DAY:

1329, 1336, 1339; {@32@}, 1418, 1423, 1426, 1428, 1443:
The Saṃśaptakas rejoiced at the prospect of fighting with {%A.%},
who terrified them with the sound of Devadatta, and attacked
them; Subāhu and Suśarman, etc. (α), fought with {%A.%}; they
fled to Duryodhana, but, urged by the Trigarta king, they
once more returned to the field with the Nārāyaṇa cowherds.
Kṛṣṇa conveyed Arjuna to the Saṃśaptakas. The Nārāyaṇas
fought with Arjuna. {%A%}. blew the Devadatta and employed the
Tvāṣṭra weapon, that confounded the foes, who began to strike
each other; Arjuna crossed the Lalitthas, etc. (β), and used
the Vāyavya weapon to frustrate the downpour of arrows shot
by his foes, and Vāyu bore away crowds of Saṃśaptakas with
their steeds, etc. Yudhiṣṭhira disposed his troops in the form
of a semicircle. Yudhiṣṭhira fled. Arjuna's son Śrutakīrti
fought with the son of Duḥśāsana. {%A.%}, etc. (υ), fought with
Bhagadatta (upon his elephant). Urged by Arjuna, Kṛṣṇa
began to proceed against Bhagadatta; the Saṃśaptakas
(14,000, including 10,000 Gopālāḥ or Nārāyaṇāḥ) challenged
Arjuna, and he encountered them, discharged the Brāhma
weapon, defeated and slew them, and then turned against
Bhagadatta; but as Suśarman with his brothers followed
him from behind, he again attacked Suśarman, and then
again Bhagadatta; Bhagadatta, at last, consecrated his hook
with mantras so as to become the Vaiṣṇava weapon;
Kṛṣṇa received it on his breast, and it became a garland.
As {%A%}. taxed Kṛṣṇa for fighting himself, Kṛṣṇa related the
history of the Vaiṣṇavāstra ({%c%}); “the great Asura has
now been divested of that supreme weapon; now slay
Bhagadatta, that enemy of the gods, just as I formerly
slew the Asura Naraka for the good of the worlds”;
{%A%}. then slew both Bhagadatta and the elephant. Then {%A%}.
slew the two brothers Vṛṣa and Acala. Dhṛtarāṣṭra's
sons attacked Arjuna, and Śakuni employed magics in order to
confound him and Kṛṣṇa: producing clubs, etc., and asses,
etc., which {%A%}. slew with celestial weapons; then darkness,
whence harsh voices were heard; this {%A%}. dispelled with the
weapon Jyotiṣka; then waves of water, which were dried
up with the Āditya weapon; Śakuni fled. {%A%}. slaughtered
[Page077-b+ 63]
the Kuru army: some followed Droṇa, others Duryodhana;
a fierce battle took place on the southern side between Arjuna
and the Kurus. The Pāṇḍavas regretted that Arjuna was
engaged on the southern part of the field in slaughtering the
Saṃśaptakas and the Nārāyaṇa force. Having slain the
Saṃśaptakas, Arjuna fought with Droṇa, etc., employing the
Āgneya weapon; {%A%}. slew three of Karṇa's brothers (γγ).
At sunset the armies retired.—§ 593 (Abhimanyuvadhap.),
VII, {@33—51@}: THIRTEENTH DAY: {@33@}, 1456, 1466, 1468;
{@35@}, 1520, 1521; {@36@}, 1545; {@40@}, 1661; {@45@}, 1824; {@51@}, 1989,
1991: Being overcome by {%A.%}, and Droṇa having failed to seize
Yudhiṣṭhira, the Kurus were regarded as defeated; they heard
everybody praise {%A%}. and Kṛṣṇa. Next morning Duryodhana
blamed Droṇa for not having seized Yudhiṣṭhira; Droṇa
said that nobody could defeat the force protected by Arjuna
and Kṛṣṇa, save Mahādeva. The Saṃśaptakas challenged
Arjuna and took him away to the southern side of the field.
The Pāṇḍavas were headed by Bhīmasena. Abhimanyu
defeated all the warriors that encountered him with the
weapons he had received from Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa. At last
Abhimanyu was slain by Duḥśāsana's son, after Jayadratha
had checked those who tried to follow Abhimanyu.—§ 595
(do.), VII, {@71@}, 2465: Vyāsa consoled Yudhiṣṭhira, who
became free from grief; but “what shall we say to Arjuna?”
—§ 596 (Pratijñāp.), VII, {@72—81: 72@}, 2485, 2537, 2562,
2563; {@73@}, 2581, 2610; {@74@}, 2636, 2637; {@75@}, 2666, 2667,

2868, 2872, (2874), 2885; {@81@}, 2889, 2895, 2905, 2909: In
the evening Arjuna, after having slain large numbers of
Saṃśaptakas, proceeded towards his tent and told Kṛṣṇa
that his heart was afflicted; he saw indications of disaster;
Abhimanyu did not come out with smiles to receive him, etc.
He remembered that Droṇa had this day formed the circular
array, which none save Abhimanyu could break; but he had
not taught him how to come out of it after having pierced it;
he had heard the leonine shouts of the Dhārtarāṣṭras, and
Kṛṣṇa had heard Yuyutsu censuring them for having slain
a child instead of Arjuna, and then Yuyutsu had cast up his
weapons afflicted with rage and grief. Kṛṣṇa consoled Arjuna,
talking about the kṣattriya duties and heaven. None save
Kṛṣṇa and Yudhiṣṭhira (who were always acceptable to
him) could address Arjuna. Yudhiṣṭhira addressed him and
told (VII, {@72@}) him the particulars of Abhimanyu's heroism
and fall. Arjuna vowed to slay Jayadratha before the sun set
the following day (his oath); even as to As., D., men, birds,
snakes, P., wanderers of the night, B.-ṛ., and D.-ṛ., etc., he
said that they would not succeed in protecting him, even if he
entered Rasātala, or ascended the firmament, or repaired to the
city of the gods ({%Devapuraṃ%}) or the city of Diti ({%Diteḥ puraṃ%});
if the sun set before he had slain him, he would himself enter
the fire. Arjuna bent the Gāṇḍīva, Kṛṣṇa blew the Pāñca-
janya, Arjuna the Devadatta (VII, {@73@}). Having been informed
by spies, Jayadratha was overwhelmed with sorrow and fear,
thinking that not even Droṇa (α), not even D., G., As., U.,
Rā., could protect him against Arjuna. He wished to return
home. Duryodhana comforted him saying that he, Karṇa, etc.
(β), would protect him. Accompanied by Duryodhana, Jaya-
dratha that very night repaired to Droṇa and questioned him
about the difference between himself and Arjuna. Droṇa said
they had got the same instruction, but Arjuna was superior to
Jayadratha in consequence of yoga and the hard life he
had led; Droṇa would, however, protect him, forming an
[Page078-a+ 63]
impenetrable array; and, moreover, death ought not to be an
object of terror to him (VII, {@74@}). Kṛṣṇa remonstrated
with {%A%}. for his rash vow; the Kurus had expected an attack
by {%A.%}; now they would protect Jayadratha (who had mentioned
{%A.'s%}) encounter with Śiva, Hiraṇyapura, etc.); Karṇa, etc. (γ),
would be in Jayadratha's van; Droṇa's array would be half
a śakaṭa and half a lotus with a needle-mouthed array in the
middle (VII, {@75@}). {%A%}. assured Kṛṣṇa of his competence to
accomplish his vow, notwithstanding Droṇa, Sā., R., V., A.,
M., with Indra, V.-D., D., P., G., Garuḍa, etc., by means of
the Gāṇḍīva and the weapons he had obtained from Yama, etc.
(δ) (VII, {@76@}). The gods, including Indra, became very anxious.
Sinister omens appeared in nature. Kṛṣṇa went to {%A.'s%} abode
and consoled Subhadrā (mentioning the kṣattriya duties, etc.,
and revenge) (VII, {@77@}). Subhadrā bewailed Abhimanyu,
and said “Shame on Bhīmasena, etc. (ε),” because they had not
protected him. Draupadī and Uttarā came to her, lamenting.
Kṛṣṇa said that Abhimanyu had attained the most laudable
and enviable goal. Then he returned to {%A%}. (VII, {@78@}).
{%A%}. performed his usual nightly sacrifice to Śiva. Kṛṣṇa
with Dāruka repaired to his own tent. None in the Pāṇḍava
camp slept that night, thinking of {%A%}. In the middle of the
night Kṛṣṇa said to Dāruka that he had resolved to fight the
next day [if necessary]; he must equip his chariot, placing
Kaumodakī, etc., on it, making room for Garuḍa, and yoking
Balāhaka, etc. (ζ), to it; when hearing Pāñcajanya emitting
the shrill Ṛṣabha note, he should come to Kṛṣṇa (VII, {@79@}).
{%A%}. saw Kṛṣṇa in a dream, who told him not to grieve, and
mentioned the Pāśupata weapon (with which Śiva slew all
the Daityas in battle); if he remembered it now, he would
be able to slay Jayadratha next day; otherwise he must
pray to Śiva. At the Brāhma hour {%A%}. saw himself sojourning
through the sky (Himavat, Maṇimat, frequented by Si. and
Cā., etc. (η)), with Kṛṣṇa, to where Śiva was seated with
Pārvatī (description) (θ); Kṛṣṇa and {%A%}. praised <is>Mahādeva</is>
(VII, {@80@}). {%A%}. beheld the offerings that <is>Śiva</is> made every
night to <is>Kṛṣṇa</is>, and he mentally adored both Kṛṣṇa and
Śiva. Śiva told them to bring Śiva's bow and arrow from
a lake of <is>amṛta</is>. In the lake they saw two terrible snakes;
when they had uttered the <is>Brahma Śatarudriya</is>, the
snakes assumed the forms of a bow and arrow; from Śiva's
body there came out a <is>brahmacārin</is> with blue throat and
red locks, and having showed {%A%}. the use of the bow and arrow
and the mantras, he sped these weapons to that same lake.
Having thus once more obtained the Pāśupata weapon, {%A%}.
and Kṛṣṇa came back to their own camp (VII, {@81@}).—

2969, 2970; {@84@}, 2975, 2977, 2982, 2983, 2995, 2998:
Yudhiṣṭhira underwent his <is>morning rites</is> (very copious
description); Kṛṣṇa visited Yudhiṣṭhira (VII, {@82@}). Then
also Virāṭa, etc. (α), arrived. Yudhiṣṭhira asked Kṛṣṇa to
rescue the Pāṇḍavas, quoting Nārada. Kṛṣṇa assured Yudhi-
ṣṭhira of Arjuna's success (VII, {@83@}). {%A%}. came and acquainted
Yudhiṣṭhira with his dream, then he and Kṛṣṇa and Yuyu-
dhāna (these two on one chariot) set out for {%A.'s%} pavilion.
Kṛṣṇa equipped {%A.'s%} chariot (which had previously been
sanctified with mantras), which {%A%}. circumambulated with his
bow and arrow in hand. {%A.%}, Yuyudhāna, and Kṛṣṇa mounted
the chariot. Many and auspicious omens appeared. {%A%}. charged
Yuyudhāna to protect Yudhiṣṭhira in his absence (only he
or Pradyumna was able to do it). Yuyudhāna proceeded to
Yudhiṣṭhira (VII, {@84@}).—§ 598 (Jayadrathavadhap.), VII,

The warriors of Droṇa shouted in anger “where is {%A.?%}” etc.
(η). After the <is>Rudra-hour</is> had set in, {%A%}. made his
appearance, while omens appeared in nature. Durmarṣaṇa
(Dhārtarāṣṭra) took up his position in the van in order to
oppose {%A. A%}. was at the very van of his army. Kṛṣṇa
and {%A%}. blew their conchs. The Kuru army was afraid

whose division was routed (VII, {@90@}). {%A%}. met Droṇa and
asked leave to slay Jayadratha; Droṇa refused leave and
attacked {%A.; A%}. avoided him and penetrated into the Kuru
army, the Pāñcāla princes Yudhāmanyu and Uttamaujas being
the protectors of his wheels; he was opposed by Jaya, etc. (α),
and the Abhīṣāhas, etc. (β) (VII, {@91@}). {%A%}. employed the
Brāhma weapon against Droṇa, avoided him again, fought with
Kṛtavarman and the Kāmboja king Sudakṣiṇa; Kṛtavarman
prevented Yudhāmanyu and Uttamaujas from following {%A.%},
who did not slay Kṛtavarman. Śrutāyudha ({%b%}) attacked {%A%}.
and was slain by Kṛṣṇa. Then {%A%}. slew Sudakṣina; all the
troops fled away (VII, {@92@}). {%A%}. slew the Abhīṣāhas, etc.
(γ), and slew Śrutāyus and Acyutāyus with the Aindra
weapon, and then their sons Niyatāyus and Dīrghāyus. {%A%}.
caused a great carnage among the Aṅgas (on elephants), the
Kaliṅga king, etc. (on elephants), the Mlecchas, Yavanas, etc.
(δ); {%A%}. slew the Ambastha king Śrutāyus (VII, {@93@}).
Droṇa acknowledged his inability to oppose Arjuna, clad
Duryodhana in invulnerable armour and urged him to oppose
{%A%}. Duryodhana and the Trigartas, etc., proceeded towards
the chariot of {%A%}. (VII, {@94@}). {%A%}. and Kṛṣṇa steadily pro-
ceeded towards Jayadratha (description). {%A%}. slew Vinda
and Anuvinda. While Kṛṣṇa led Arjuna's steeds, {%A%}. on
foot kept the whole Kuru army in check, and piercing the
earth with a weapon made a lake for his steeds to drink
from and a hall of arrows for them to rest within; Nārada
came to see the lake (VII, {@99@}). Si. and Cā., etc., applauded
(VII, {@100@}). The progress of Arjuna (with Kṛṣṇa) became
irresistible. Duryodhana (VII, {@101@}) fought with Arjuna
(VII, {@102@}), who had also got the same invulnerable armour
from Indra; {%A%}. shot terrible shafts consecrated with mantras
at Duryodhana; this weapon could not be used again lest it
should slay {%A%}. himself; {%A%}. deprived Duryodhana of his
chariot, steeds, and weapons; when Kṛṣṇa blew the Pāñca-
[Page079-a+ 63]
janya and {%A%}. bent the Gāṇḍīva, the Kurus fell down on
the ground. The protectors of Jayadratha attacked Kṛṣṇa
and {%A%}. (VII, {@103@}). {%A%}. fought Bhūriśravas, etc. (μ), (and
blew the Devadatta), Duryodhana, Aśvatthāman (VII, {@104@}),
and slew many chariot-warriors. {%A.'s%} standard bore the
sign of an ape with fierce face and tail like that of the
lion (ν) (VII, {@105@}). Yudhiṣṭhira heard the blare of
Pāñcajanya and thought {%A%}. to be in distress; he requested
Sātyaki to go to {%A%}. and bring him intelligence of his safety;
{%A%}. had said in the Dvaita wood to Yudhiṣṭhira, “even if
Kṛṣṇa, etc. (σ), assists us, I shall yet appoint Sātyaki for
our aid, since there is none equal to him,” and Yudhiṣṭhira
had witnessed his reverence for {%A%}. at Dvārakā, after his
return from the tīrthas, etc.; “the day is about to end”;
Pradyumna and Sātyaki are equal to {%A%}. in bravery (VII, {@110@}).
Sātyaki hesitated to comply with Yudhiṣṭhira's request on
the ground of a counter-command by {%A.%}; “the Sauvīrakas,
etc. (τ), D., As., men, Rā., K., M.-U., etc., cannot cope with
{%A%}. in battle” (VII, {@111@}). Sātyaki agreed to obey Yudhi-
ṣṭhira's order; “the distance from here is 3 yojanas”; he
would crush the elephants of the Añjana breed mounted by
Mlecchas (named Rukmarathas), who at Karṇa's command
had returned from the pursuit of {%A%}. and were waiting for
Sātyaki, and likewise crush those 700 elephants mounted
by Kirātas ({%c%}) and formerly given by the Kirāta king to {%A%}.
(VII, {@112@}). Yuyudhāna proceeded towards the chariot of
{%A%}. (VII, {@120@}). Yudhiṣṭhira was anxious because he had
not obtained any news of {%A%}. and Sātyaki, and thought
of sending Bhīma after Sātyaki; Bhīma penetrated to
Arjuna, making his presence known by a roar; {%A%}. and Kṛṣṇa
uttered loud roars in return; Yudhiṣṭhira understood that
all was safe, and recalled {%A.'s%} feats (ππ) (VII, {@128@}). {%A%}. bent
the Gāṇḍīva, and Kṛṣṇa blew the Pāñcajanya (VII, {@129@}).
Yudhāmanyu and Uttamaujas proceeded towards {%A%}. (VII,
{@130@}). Bhīma was attacked by Karṇa; Kṛṣṇa and {%A%}. became
anxious for Bhīma (VII, {@132@}). Bhīma gladdened {%A.%}, etc.
(ψψ) (VII, {@136@}). Bhīma's weapons being exhausted, he
fled away from Karṇa and defended himself with the bodies of
the elephants slain by {%A.%}; but, recollecting {%A.'s%} vow, he did
not take the life of Karṇa; and Karṇa, recollecting his promise
to Kuntī, did not take the life of Bhīma; {%A%}. then turned Karṇa
and then Aśvatthāman to flight (VII, {@139@}). Sātyaki slew the
steeds of Duḥśāsana, gladdening {%A%}. and Kṛṣṇa (VII, {@140@}).
Sātyaki approached {%A.%}, who was anxious for Yudhiṣṭhira
(εεε) (VII, {@141@}). As Sātyaki succumbed to Bhūriśravas,
{%A.%}, urged by Kṛṣṇa, cut off one of the arms of Bhūriśravas
(VII, {@142@}). Bhūriśravas rebuked {%A%}. (ηηη); {%A%}. justified his
conduct (θθθ). Bhūriśravas ({%d%}) desired to die in <is>prāya</is>
(description); he acknowledged the justice of {%A.'s%} plea, and
was blessed by Kṛṣṇa and {%A%}. (ιιι). Though forbidden by
Kṛṣṇa, etc. (κκκ), Sātyaki slew Bhūriśravas sitting in prāya
(VII, {@143@}). {%A%}. proceeded to Jayadratha's chariot; Duryo-
dhana, etc. (μμμ), encountered {%A%}. Duryodhana prevailed upon
Karṇa to protect Jayadratha (ννν); {%A%}. deprived Karṇa of his
steeds, chariot, and charioteer. {%A%}. invoked the Vāruṇa
weapon and caused a great carnage (VII, {@145@}). {%A%}. employed
the <is>Aindra</is> weapon, etc. (description). {%A%}. cut off Jaya-
dratha's standard and slew his charioteer; Jayadratha was
put into their centre by six chariot-warriors. Kṛṣṇa
covered the sun by means of his yoga power, so that all,
except {%A.%}, thought the sun to have set, and he urged
{%A%}. to cut off Jayadratha's head without delay; {%A%}. caused
such a carnage that the warriors abandoned Jayadratha
[Page079-b+ 63]
in fear and fled away; Kṛṣṇa again urged {%A%}. to cut off
Jayadratha's head without delay, telling him about the curse
of Jayadratha's father <is>Vṛddhakṣattra</is> ({%g%}), who was still
engaged in penances outside Samantapañcaka; therefore {%A%}.
should make the head fall upon the lap of Vṛddhakṣattra
himself, lest {%A.'s%} head should crack into 100 pieces; this {%A%}.
did, and as the head fell down from Vṛddhakṣattra's lap
the latter's head split into 100 pieces. Kṛṣṇa then withdrew
the darkness he had created; Kṛṣṇa and {%A%}. blew their
conchs, etc.; {%A%}. fought with many mighty chariot-warriors
(VII, {@146@}); Kṛpa (at whose death-like swoon {%A%}. grieved),
Aśvatthāman (who fled), Karṇa; Kṛṣṇa told {%A%}. to avoid
Karṇa, because the latter was still in possession of the
lance that Indra had given him. “In this world there
are only three mighty archers, Kṛṣṇa, {%A.%}, and Sātyaki,”
said Sañjaya (VII, {@147@}). Bhīma tried to induce {%A%}. to
permit him to slay Karṇa; {%A%}. vowed to slay Karṇa's
son Vṛṣaseṇa in his presence. Kṛṣṇa congratulated {%A%}.
(ϕϕϕ), who attributed the victory to Kṛṣṇa; Kṛṣṇa
pointed out to {%A%}. the results of that day's battle
(VII, {@148@}). Kṛṣṇa and {%A%}. congratulated Yudhiṣṭhira
(ψψψ) (VII, {@149@}). A fierce battle ensued (VII, {@152@}).—

Karṇa vowed to slay {%A.%}, etc. (υ) (VII, {@158@}). Aśvatthāman,

steeds and driver of Karṇa, etc.; Duryodhana fought with {%A.%};
Kṛpa urged Aśvatthāman to proceed against {%A.%}; he made
Duryodhana desist from an encounter with {%A%}. (VII, {@159@}).
{%A%}. slew the Yaudheyas, etc. (ζζ); the Pāñcālas fled, but were
rallied by Bhīma and {%A.%}; the Kauravas fled (VII, {@161@}).
Kṛṣṇa told Yudhiṣṭhira not to fight with Droṇa, he should
go to Duryodhana, {%A.%}, and Bhīma (VII, {@162@}). Duryodhana
commanded his troops to take up lighted lamps and torches
(VII, {@163@}). “Karṇa will vanquish {%A.%}, etc.,” said Droṇa;
{%A%}. fought against the Kauravas (VII, {@164@}). Alambuṣa fought
with {%A%}. (VII, {@165@}). {%A%}. vanquished Alambuṣa and attacked
Droṇa (VII, {@167@}). A new battle ensued (description) (VII,
{@169@}); the Gāṇḍīva and the rattle of {%A.'s%} chariot were heard;
Duryodhana despatched Śakuni against {%A%}. (VII, {@170@}).
{%A%}. deprived Śakuni of his chariot, etc.; Kṛṣṇa and {%A%}.
blew their conchs (VII, {@171@}). The Pāṇḍava host fled; {%A%}.
and Kṛṣṇa rallied the retreating troops (σσ) (VII, {@172@}).
Dhṛṣṭadyumna was deprived of his chariot by Karṇa,
and ascended the chariot of {%A. A%}. and Kṛṣṇa and Yudhi-
ṣṭhira conversed about Karṇa; {%A%}. asked Kṛṣṇa to proceed
towards Karṇa. Kṛṣṇa said that none except {%A%}. and
Ghaṭotkaca could encounter him; but {%A%}. must not do it
as long as he retained the lance presented by Indra; “but
Ghaṭotkaca will vanquish Karṇa.” They prevailed upon
Ghaṭotkaca to encounter Karṇa (ττ) (VII, {@173@}). Ghaṭotkaca
slew Alambuṣa and fought with Karṇa (VII, {@174@}). Kṛṣṇa
urged {%A%}. to proceed in Bhīma's wake and resist Droṇa's
division (VII, {@177@}). {%A%}. shot many Kṣattriyas (VII, {@178@}).
[Page080-a+ 63]
Karṇa slew Ghaṭotkaca with his celestial dart (VII, {@179@}).
Kṛṣṇa with transports of delight embraced {%A.%}, because
Karṇa's dart could no more kill {%A%}. (VII, {@180@}). Kṛṣṇa's
policy was the reason why Karṇa had never hurled the fatal
dart at {%A%}. (VII, {@182@}).—§ 601 (Droṇavadhap.), VII,

{%A%}. granted permission to the warriors to sleep. D., Ṛ., and
soldiers applauded {%A.%}; all the combatants lay down on
the field to sleep (description); the Kaurava troops blessed
{%A%}. for his act of kindness. When the moon rose, both hosts
rose from sleep and again prepared for battle (VII, {@184@}).
Droṇa described the extent of {%A.'s%} might and prowess (γ);
Duryodhana vowed that he would slay {%A%}. that day. Droṇa was
of opinion that it was only right that Duryodhana and Śakuni
should proceed against {%A%}. (VII, {@185@}).—§ 602 (do.), VII,

night had worn away the battle once more commenced.
Urged by Kṛṣṇa {%A%}. moved to the left of Droṇa and Karṇa.
Bhīma urged {%A%}. to put forth all his vigour. {%A%}. fought with
Droṇa, Karṇa, etc. (ζ) (description); he was assisted by
Drupada, etc. Soon the morning sun arose (VII, {@186@}). The
battle was revived (VII, {@187@}). D., G., Ṛ., Si., Aps., Y.,
and Rā. applauded Droṇa and {%A.%}, saying that “this is no
human, etc. (μ), but an exalted Brāhma encounter”; both
employed the Brāhma weapon; the engagement became
general (VII, {@188@}). {%A%}. attacked the Kurus, and Droṇa
attacked the Pāñcālas (VII, {@189@}). The Pāṇḍavas feared,
thinking that {%A%}. would not fight with Droṇa. Kṛṣṇa
told {%A%}. to abandon virtue and let some one tell Droṇa
that Aśvatthāman had been slain in battle. {%A%}. did not
approve; others approved, Yudhiṣṭhira, however, with great
difficulty (VII, {@190@}). A fierce encounter took place between
Droṇa and Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Sātyaki rescued Dhṛṣṭadyumna
and was applauded by Kṛṣṇa, {%A.%}, and Si., etc. (VII, {@191@}).
Dhṛṣṭadyumna cut off Droṇa's head, though forbidden by
{%A%}. and blamed by everybody (VII, {@192@}).—§ 603 (Nārāya—

9444, 9479; {@202@}, 9645: Aśvatthāman was filled with rage;
he said there was none equal to him and {%A%}. in knowledge
of arms; he had a weapon (the Nārāyaṇa weapon) that
neither {%A.%}, etc. (δ), knew, presented by Nārāyaṇa to his father,
with the promise that no man should ever be his equal in
battle; only this weapon must never be used in haste, etc.,
and never be hurled upon persons that abandoned their chariots
and weapons in battle, etc.; with this he would rout and slay
the Pāṇḍavas, etc. (ι) (VII, {@195@}). Terrible signs appeared
in nature. Yudhiṣṭhira spoke about the matter to {%A%}. (κ);
{%A%}. in reply described the prowess of Aśvatthāman and the
unrighteousness of the Pāṇḍavas in slaying Droṇa (λ); “all
of us have passed the greater parts of our lives; the days that
remain to us are few; this exceedingly unrighteous act has
stained what is left;…I did not interfere, as he was
about to be slain; for this fault I have already sunk into
hell, overcome with shame” (VII, {@196@}). Bhīmasena,
reproaching {%A.%}, vindicated the deed (μ) (VII, {@197@}). {%A%}. cast
oblique glances upon Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Dhṛṣṭadyumna taunted
Sātyaki for the slaughter of Bhūriśravas (ρ); Sātyaki would
[Page080-b+ 63]
slay Dhṛṣṭadyumna; Dhṛṣṭadyumna asked Bhīma to let
him slay Sātyaki (τ); then he and {%A%}. would slay the enemies.
Kṛṣṇa and Yudhiṣṭhira restored peace (VII, {@198@}).
Aśvatthāman invoked the Nārāyaṇa weapon (description).
Kṛṣṇa prevailed upon the troops to lay down their weapons
and alight from their chariots; Bhīmasena alone refused to do
so. {%A%}. said that his vow was that the Gāṇḍīva should not be
used against the Nārāyaṇa weapon, kine, and brahmans. Bhīma
attacked Aśvatthāman, but was overwhelmed by the energy of
the Nārāyaṇa weapon (VII, {@199@}). {%A%}. covered Bhīmasena with
the Vāruṇa weapon; he and Kṛṣṇa forcibly brought Bhīma
down from his chariot, making him abandon his weapons.
Then the Nārāyaṇa weapon became pacified. It could not be
used twice. {%A.%}, etc. (γγ), fought with Aśvatthāman (VII,
{@200@}). {%A%}. addressed Aśvatthāman in harsh words (δδ),
though {%A%}. and Aśvatthāman loved each other. Aśvatthāman
became angry with {%A%}. and especially with Kṛṣṇa, touched
water, and invoked the Āgneya weapon, the result being
sinister omens and a great slaughter in the Pāṇḍava army;
{%A%}. invoked the Brāhma weapon; the darkness was dispelled,
etc., a full akṣauhiṇī of the Pāṇḍava troops had been
felled; Kṛṣṇa and {%A%}. were unwounded; Aśvatthāman
lost heart and ran away; he met Vyāsa, who told him the
history of Nārāyaṇa ({%b%}); “Nara and Nārāyaṇa are {%A%}. and
Kṛṣṇa” (VII, {@201@}). {%A%}. met with Vyāsa and inquired of
him about the invisible person who aided him in the battle.
Vyāsa said that it was Mahādeva himself, and related the tale
of the sacrifice of Dakṣa, the destruction of Tripura ({%d%}), etc.

a long time with the Pāṇḍavas (Arjuna). On the approach
of the evening twilight the Kauravas retired to their en-
campment; they held a consultation in the night; Karṇa
was installed as generalissimo (ι) (VIII, {@10@}). Yudhiṣṭhira
asked {%A%}. to array the Pāṇḍava army and slay Karṇa. The
Pāṇḍava army was arranged after the form of a half-moon,
{%A%}. in the middle (ω); Yudhāmanyu and Uttamaujas became
the protectors of {%A.'s%} chariot-wheels (VIII, {@11@}). {%A%}. fought
with the Saṃśaptakas (VIII, {@13, 16@}) and Aśvatthāman (VIII,
{@16@}). The Kaliṅga, Vaṅga, and Niṣāda heroes attacked {%A%}.
with a division of elephants, which was broken; Kṛṣṇa urged
{%A%}. not to spare Aśvatthāman, who was at last borne away by
his steeds; Kṛṣṇa and {%A%}. proceeded towards the Saṃśaptakas
(VIII, {@17@}). Urged by Kṛṣṇa, {%A%}. slew the Magadha chief
Daṇḍadhāra (lord of Girivraja), (on an elephant), and then
his brother Daṇḍa; {%A%}. once more proceeded against the
Saṃśaptakas (VIII, {@18@}), whom he slaughtered; {%A%}. slew
Ugrāyudha's son; urged by Kṛṣṇa, {%A%}. defeated the
remnant of the Saṃśaptakas in order not to lose any time
in slaying Karṇa (VIII, {@19@}). Kṛṣṇa said to {%A%}. that he did
[Page081-a+ 63]
not see Yudhiṣṭhira (VIII, {@21@}). {%A%}. fought the Trigartas,
etc. (λλ), slew king Śatruñjaya, and Suśruta's son and
Candradeva; king Satyasena wounded Kṛṣṇa and was slain
by {%A.%}, who then slew Citravarman and Mitrasena, etc.,
and wounded Suśarman; all the Saṃśaptakas attacked {%A.%},
who invoked the Aindra weapon (description); the hostile
army fled away almost entirely (VIII, {@27@}). Karṇa
slaughtered the Pāñcālas, {%A%}. the Trigartas, etc., when
the sun had passed the meridian (VIII, {@28@}). In the
afternoon {%A%}. and Kṛṣṇa (having said their daily prayers
and worshipped Bhava) destroyed the Kurus; {%A%}. fought
Duryodhana, Aśvatthāman, Karṇa. At the close of the day
both armies withdrew; Rā. and Pś., etc., came (VIII, {@30@}).
Dhṛtarāṣṭra exalted the prowess of {%A%}. (οο). Karṇa assured
Duryodhana that he would slay {%A%}. next day; at dawn he
repeated his pledge: “{%A%}. is superior to me only by having
Kṛṣṇa, the creator of the universe, for his charioteer, the
chariot given him by Agni, his steed, and his standard with
the ape.” He wanted Śalya (“who is superior to Kṛṣṇa”)
as his charioteer (VIII, {@31@}).—§ 606 (do.), VIII, {@35@}, 1657:
Duryodhana prevailed upon Śalya to be Karṇa's charioteer

pointing to the fact that Kṛṣṇa had become the charioteer
of {%A.%}, and would fight if {%A%}. were slain (VIII, {@35@}).—§ 607

(VIII, {@36@}). Karṇa boasted (γ); Śalya ridiculed him and
praised {%A%}. (δ). Karṇa proceeded on his chariot and inquired
after {%A%}. (VIII, {@37@}), promising every Pāṇḍava soldier that
he who pointed out to him {%A%}. would receive whatever
wealth he desired (VIII, {@38@}). Śalya said that Karṇa would
have a sight of {%A%}. without troubling to make a search, and
asked him to abandon his desire for a single combat with {%A%}.
(VIII, {@39@}). Karṇa said that Kṛṣṇa and {%A%}. were well known
to him but did not inspire him with fright; notwithstanding the
curse of Paraśu-Rāma he would slay {%A.%}; he would employ
the Brāhma weapon, which {%A%}. would never be able to escape,

fought the Saṃśaptakas (VIII, {@47@}). {%A%}. fought the Saṃśap-

birds came down and devoured the snakes; {%A%}. sat down,
recovered, and invoked the Aindra weapon; the battle became

Kṛṣṇa upon beholding Karṇa's ({%e%}) prowess, and as the
Saṃśaptakas were defeated (when the sun had ascended the

remains.” {%A%}. proceeded to Yudhiṣṭhira; Kṛṣṇa described
the field of battle to {%A%}. (γγ). A terrible battle ensued
(VIII, {@58@}). A remnant only of the Saṃśaptakas were
left unslaughtered. Dhṛṣṭadyumna was worsted by Aśvat-
thāman and rescued by {%A.; A%}. proceeded towards the
Saṃśaptakas (VIII, {@59@}). Kṛṣṇa pointed out to {%A%}. that
Yudhiṣṭhira was being pursued by many Dhārtarāṣṭras
and was in great danger; Karṇa would soon come against
{%A%}. and was protected by Duryodhana; he should be slain.
{%A%}. then destroyed the remnant of his foes; the Saṃśaptakas
fled (VIII, {@60@}). {%A%}. fought against Aśvatthāman (VIII,
{@61@}). {%A%}. appeared (VIII, {@62@}). Śalya exhorted Karṇa to
fight with {%A.%}, but in vain; he once more reminded Karṇa
of {%A.%}, etc. (ηη) (VIII, {@63@}). {%A%}. fought with Aśvatthāman;
Aśvatthāman employed the Aindra weapon, which {%A%}.
neutralized with a mighty weapon created by Indra; at
last Aśvatthāman was borne away by his steeds. The
Sṛñjayas called upon {%A%}. and Kṛṣṇa. {%A%}. spoke to Kṛṣṇa
about Karṇa; Kṛṣṇa asked him first to find Yudhiṣṭhira
(VIII, {@64@}). {%A%}. met with Bhīma and asked him to bring
intelligence of Yudhiṣṭhira; but they agreed that {%A%}.
should go to Yudhiṣṭhira while Bhīma should resist the
Saṃśaptakas. {%A%}. and Kṛṣṇa found Yudhiṣṭhira lying on
his bed (VIII, {@65@}). {%A%}. swore to slay Karṇa and all the
[Page082-a+ 63]
foes that day (VIII, {@67@}). Yudhiṣṭhira censured {%A.%},
thinking that he had run away from the battle leaving Bhīma
unsupported (λλλ), several times invoking him to give up
the Gāṇḍīva to somebody else (VIII, {@68@}). {%A%}. drew his sword
in order to strike off Yudhiṣṭhira's head in fulfilment of his
vow regarding the person who would tell him to give up the
Gāṇḍīva (μμμ); Kṛṣṇa addressed {%A%}. on the nature of truth
(ννν); {%A%}. said he must keep his vow (ξξξ); Kṛṣṇa suggested
that {%A.%}, by insulting Yudhiṣṭhira, by addressing him with
“thou,” would be regarded as having slain him (οοο) (VIII,
{@69@}). Urged by Kṛṣṇa, {%A%}. insulted Yudhiṣṭhira in a long
speech (πππ); then he became despondent and desired to
cut off his own head; Kṛṣṇa urged him to utter his own
praises, as self-praise was equal to self-destruction. {%A%}. praised
himself (ρρρ) and asked for Yudhiṣṭhira's forgiveness,
promising to slay Karṇa and rescue Bhīma. Kṛṣṇa induced
him to forgive both himself and {%A%}. (σσσ) (VIII, {@70@}).
Speeches of Kṛṣṇa, {%A.%}, and Yudhiṣṭhira on the same topic
(τττ) (VIII, {@71@}). {%A%}. proceeded to slay Karṇa, having
obtained Yudhiṣṭhira's leave; Kṛṣṇa addressed {%A%}. in order
to raise his spirits (υυυ) (VIII, {@72@}); continuation (υυυ)
(VIII, {@73@}). {%A.'s%} cheerful reply to Kṛṣṇa (ψψψ) (VIII,
{@74@}). Sañjaya related; {%A%}. slew many (VIII, {@75@}). Bhīma
said to his charioteer Viśoka that he was anxious about {%A%}.
and Yudhiṣṭhira; Viśoka pointed out to Bhīma that {%A%}. was
returning to battle (ωωω) (VIII, {@76@}). {%A%}. and Bhīma attacked
the Kaurava army (description) (VIII, {@77@}). {%A%}. produced
a river of blood (description). Requested by {%A%}. (ζ), Kṛṣṇa
brought him to Karṇa; Duryodhana attacked {%A.; A%}.
vanquished Aśvatthāman, Kṛpa, and Kṛtavarman; Śikhaṇḍin,
etc. (ιʹ), proceeding towards {%A.%}, checked the foes (VIII, {@79@}).
{%A.%}, avoiding Karṇa, proceeded to the rescue of Bhīma; he
informed Bhīma that Yudhiṣṭhira was well; he slew ten
sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra (VIII, {@80@}). {%A%}. was assailed by ninety
Saṃśaptakas as he was proceeding towards Karna's chariot;
he slew them; so also many Kauravas and a force of Mlecchas,
mounted on 1,300 elephants under the command of Duryodhana.
Bhīma rushed towards {%A.%}, and destroyed a small unslaughtered
remnant of the Kauravas; then he followed {%A%}. in his rear
(VIII, {@81@}). Kṛṣṇa urged {%A%}. to slay Karṇa; {%A%}. proceeded
with Bhīmasena (VIII, {@82@}). Bhīmasena took up a little of
Duḥśāsana's blood and drank it (μʹ), addressing Kṛṣṇa
and {%A.%}, and vowing soon to slay Duryodhana (VIII, {@83@}).
Urged by Bhīma and Nakula, {%A%}. proceeded towards Vṛṣasena
(VIII, {@84@}). {%A%}. slew Karṇa's son Vṛṣasena, and threatened
to slay Karṇa, as Bhīma would slay Duryodhana; {%A%}. attacked
Karṇa (VIII, {@85@}); Kṛṣṇa addressed {%A%}. (τʹ); {%A.'s%} reply
(υʹ) (VIII, {@86@}); description of {%A%}. and Karṇa (ϕʹ); As.,
Yātudhānas, Gh., etc., sided with Karṇa; the Vedas,
etc. (χʹ), took the side of {%A.%}; the smaller snakes all
sided with Karṇa; V., M., Sā., R., V.-D., A., and Agni,
etc. (χʹ), sided with {%A.%}, while all Ā. sided with Karṇa;
the Vaiśyas, etc. (ψʹ), sided with Karṇa; P., etc. (χʹ), with
{%A.%}; the Pretas, Pś., Rā., etc., with Karṇa; D.-ṛ., B.-ṛ.,
R.-ṛ., with {%A.%}, as also G. headed by Tumburu. With the
Prādheyas and Mauneyas, G., and Aps., and many wise
sages, having wolves for their vehicles, came to witness the
encounter that was also witnessed by D., Dā., G., N., Y., etc.,
M.-ṛ., P. (subsisting upon Svadhā), etc., and Brahmán with
B.-ṛ., and Prajāpatis, and Bhava. Indra wished that {%A%}.
should vanquish Karṇa; Sūrya, that Karṇa should vanquish
{%A.%}; the gods urged Brahmán that the success of both should
be equal, Indra that {%A%}. and Kṛṣṇa should win; Brahmán
[Page082-b+ 63]
and Īśāna (i.e. Śiva) said that the victory of {%A%}. was certain
(ωʹ): “let Karṇa obtain identity with V. or M., let him
be worshipped in heaven with Droṇa and Bhīṣma.” Indra
acquiesced by their words. Description of Karṇa's and {%A.'s%}
chariots; the ape on {%A.'s%} banner attacked the elephant's rope
on Karṇa's banner. Kṛṣṇa and Śalya darted keen glances at
each other, and so did {%A%}. and Karṇa. Śalya said that he would
slay both Kṛṣṇa and {%A%}. if Karṇa was slain; Kṛṣṇa said that
Karṇa could not slay {%A.%}; otherwise, the destruction of the
universe would be at hand, and he would himself slay Karṇa
and Śalya. {%A%}. said that that day the wives of Karṇa would
become widows (ααʹ) (VIII, {@87@}). In the welkin D., N.,
As., Si., Y., G., Rā., Aps., and B.-ṛ., etc., looked on. The
battle commenced. {%A%}. defeated Duryodhana, etc. (VIII,
{@88@}); description of the battle between {%A%}. and Karṇa; {%A%}.
employed an Āgneya weapon, which was neutralized by
Karṇa with a Vāruṇa weapon by means of clouds, which
was in its turn dispelled by {%A%}. by means of a Vāyavya
weapon; {%A%}. employed the Aindra weapon ({%? dayitaṃ deva-%}
{%rājñaḥ; Mahendrasyāstraṃ%}), Karṇa the Bhārgava weapon.
Seeing {%A.'s%} weapons neutralized by Karṇa, Bhīma (αεʹ) and
Kṛṣṇa (αζʹ) urged {%A%}. to put forth his strength. {%A%}. bowed
to Brahmán and invoked the Brāhma weapon, which could be
applied by the mind alone; Karṇa neutralized it; urged by
Bhīma, {%A%}. applied a second Brāhma weapon, which caused
a great carnage among the Kaurava troops (description).
{%A%}. shot at Karṇa and Śalya and slew Sabhāpati, etc. The
Kauravas urged Karṇa to slay {%A%}. Yudhiṣṭhira appeared in
order to witness the encounter. {%A.'s%} bowstring burst; Karṇa
pierced {%A%}. (αδʹ). Karṇa employed five snakes as arrows;
they were cut off by {%A.%}, who slew 2,000 Kurus. The Kurus
fled, leaving Karṇa to fight alone with {%A%}. (VIII, {@89@}). The
snake Aśvasena entered into Karṇa's quiver in the form of an
arrow. Karṇa and {%A%}. were fanned and sprinkled with
fragrant sandal-water by many Aps., staying in the welkin,
and Śakra and Sūrya gently brushed their faces with their
hands. Karṇa aimed that arrow which he had long kept for
{%A.'s%} destruction. Omens appeared; Karṇa did not know that
Aśvasena had entered his arrow. Kṛṣṇa with his feet
pressed {%A.'s%} car about a cubit into the earth and the snake-
arrow only broke his diadem (made by Svayambhū for
Indra > {%A%}.); incapable of being crushed by Rudra, etc. (αιʹ).
Karṇa would not shoot the same weapon again. Aśvasena then
of his own accord came towards {%A%}. in the shape of an arrow;
Kṛṣṇa informed {%A.; A%}. cut off the snake, and Kṛṣṇa raised
the chariot from the earth. Once, when Karṇa was stupefied,
{%A%}. did not wish to slay him, but he was taught by Kṛṣṇa
never to spare an enemy. Karṇa invoked the Brāhma weapon
and {%A%}. the Aindra weapon, which was neutralized by Karṇa;
urged by Kṛṣṇa to shoot “high weapons,” {%A%}. shot the Brāhma
weapon. Karṇa cut off eleven bowstrings of {%A.'s%} one after
another, not knowing that {%A%}. had 100 strings to his bow;
urged by Kṛṣṇa to strike Karṇa with “superior weapons,”
{%A%}. then consecrated another celestial weapon with mantras,
uniting the Raudra weapon with it. At that time the earth
swallowed up Karṇa's wheels. Karṇa asked {%A%}. to wait for
a moment till he had raised his sunken wheel (VIII, {@90@}).
Kṛṣṇa urged {%A%}. to pierce Karṇa with a celestial weapon;
{%A%}. kindled with fury; blazing flames of fire seemed to
emanate from all the pores of his body. Both Karṇa and {%A%}.
invoked the Brāhma weapon; {%A%}. shot an Agni weapon,
which was neutralized by Karṇa with the Vāruṇa weapon,
spreading darkness in all directions, which {%A%}. dispelled
[Page083-a+ 63]
with the Vāyavya weapon. Pierced by a shaft of Karṇa's,
{%A%}. began to reel, etc.; Karṇa in vain endeavoured to
extricate his chariot. Recovering his senses, {%A%}. took up an
Añjalika weapon. Urged by Kṛṣṇa, {%A%}. cut off Karṇa's
standard, and then struck off Karṇa's head with an Añjalika
weapon (the Ṛ. loudly crying out “Peace be to the
universe!”) (VIII, {@91@}). {%A%}. fought the chariots of the
Kauravas. {%A%}. and Kṛṣṇa blew their conchs; D., G., men,
Cā., M.-ṛ., Y., and M.-U. congratulated {%A%}. (VIII, {@94@}). Urged
by Kṛṣṇa (αϕʹ), {%A%}. presented himself to Yudhiṣṭhira, who
greeted {%A%}. and Kṛṣṇa. Yudhiṣṭhira, with Kṛṣṇa and {%A.%},
came back to the field to have a look at Karṇa's body (VIII,

{%A%}. fought against the chariots; Duryodhana rallied a
small force by a spirited address (ζζ); the Pāṇḍavas,
and especially {%A.%}, rushed against them (IX, {@19@}). The
whole army of Duryodhana fled except Duryodhana (IX, {@21@}).
{%A%}. (desiring to exterminate the Kurus) addressed Kṛṣṇa,
recounting the loss sustained by the Kurus (νν), and attacked

(IX, {@24@}). {%A%}. and Bhīma, etc. (οο), slew 3,000 elephants,
encompassing the Pāṇḍava brothers; {%A%}. had afflicted Sañjaya's

Satyeṣu, and the Prasthala ruler Suśarman, and the latter's

{@29—31: 29@}, 1568, 1600; {@30@}, 1725: the followers of
Śakuni attacked the Pāṇḍavas; {%A%}. and Bhīmasena came to the
rescue of Sahadeva; {%A%}. slew them. Duryodhana abandoned
his slain steed, and fled away without a companion, on foot
towards a lake, taking up his mace. The Pāṇḍavas with {%A%}.
baffled the purpose of the Kurus. In Duryodhana's army no
great chariot-warrior was alive save Aśvatthāman, Kṛpa, and
Kṛtavarman (IX, {@29@}). When the sun had set, {%A.%}, etc. (ε),
started towards the lake (IX, {@30@}). Yudhiṣṭhira in vain
exhorted Duryodhana to come out from the lake and fight with

with his brothers and Duryodhana, proceeded to Samanta-
pañcaka (IX, {@55@}). {%A%}. inquires of Kṛṣṇa about the relative
merits of the two combatants. Kṛṣṇa said that by fighting
fairly Bhīma would never succeed in vanquishing Duryodhana.
{%A%}. struck his own left thigh before the eyes of Bhīmasena,
who understood the sign and fractured Duryodhana's thigh
with his mace (IX, {@58@}). Kṛṣṇa caused {%A%}. to take down the
Gāṇḍīva and his inexhaustible quivers, and then to dismount;
then Kṛṣṇa also dismounted; the celestial Ape on his standard
disappeared, and the chariot (burnt by Droṇa and Karṇa with
the Brāhma weapon) with its steeds, etc., was reduced to ashes.
At Kṛṣṇa's suggestion the Pāṇḍavas and Sātyaki resolved to
pass the night at a spot outside the camp, on the banks of the
Oghavatī. They then despatched Kṛṣṇa to Hāstinapura in
order to pacify the wrath of Gāndhārī and console her and
Dhṛtarāṣṭra (IX, {@62@}). Duryodhana induced Kṛpa to instal
Aśvatthāman as the Kuru generalissimo; then they took

with Kṛṣṇa proceeded in the track of Bhīmasena and Nakula
in pursuit of Aśvatthāman: Kṛṣṇa, {%A.%}, and Yudhiṣṭhira
on Kṛṣṇa's chariot. Aśvatthāman shot a celestial weapon
“for the destruction of the Pāṇḍavas” (X, {@13@}). Urged by
Kṛṣṇa, {%A%}. shot the [Brāhma] weapon. Extraordinary omens
appeared in nature; Nārada and Vyāsa, seeking to save the
three worlds, stood between the two fires (X, {@14@}). {%A%}. with-
drew his weapon, but Aśvatthāman could not. Vyāsa praised
{%A%}. for not having used the Brahmaśiras weapon before
(X, {@15@}). Kṛṣṇa said that Uttarā's son Parikṣit would be
stillborn, but be brought to life by Kṛṣṇa, etc. Aśvatthāman's

1759: Bhīṣma had been overthrown in battle by {%A.%}; he

they burnt the corpse of Bhīṣma, Bhīmasena and {%A%}. held

he now, however, recited what the brahman Kāśyapa had
heard from a brahman crowned with ascetic success about
Jīva (the individual Soul), etc. (i.e. Anugītā).—§ 782{%b%}
(Brāhmaṇagītā), XIV, {@34@}, (932): When Kṛṣṇa had
finished the Brāhmaṇagītā, {%A%}. asked where that brāhmaṇī
and that brahman were now; Kṛṣṇa said: “My mind

brāhmaṇī; he who has been called {%kṣetrajña%}, I am myself.”
—§ 782 (Anugītāp.), XIV, {@35@}, (934): Asked by {%A%}. about
Bráhman, Kṛṣṇa recited the old history about the discourse

sacrifice; {%A%}. with the Gāṇḍīva followed the horse; all
Hāstinapura came out to see him; a disciple of Yājñavalkya
followed him in order to perform auspicious rites for him,
and also many brahmans and kṣattriyas. In course of the
horse's wandering many great and wonderful battles were
fought. The horse wandered over the whole earth; from
the North it turned to the East; myriads of kings fought
with {%A.%}, because they had lost their kinsmen on the field of
Kurukṣetra, the same did innumerable Kirātas, Yavanas,
Mlecchas, and Āryas. {@74@}: The Trigartas attacked {%A.%}, who
in vain asked them to forbear; the Trigarta king Sūryavarman
fought with {%A.%}, who slew his younger brother Ketuvarman;
then he fought Dhṛtavarman, was wounded in his hand and

warriors; the Trigartas fled and accepted {%A.'s%} dominion.
{@75@}, 2188, 2190: In Prāgjyotiṣa, Bhagadatta's son king
Vajradatta (description) attacked {%A%}. on his elephant, but,

during three days, he on the fourth day had his elephant slain,
and promised to come to the horse-sacrifice. {@77@}: The
Saindhavas seated on chariots attacked {%A.%}, who was on foot,
recollecting Jayadratha; omens appeared; the Gāṇḍīva fell
down; the gods, etc., shouted “victory” to {%A.%}, who once more
used his bow; the Saindhavas fled. {@78@}, 2265, 2273, 2280:
The Saindhavas once more rallied; {%A%}. urged them to surrender,
but in vain; then Duḥśalā, taking her grandson, the son of
Suratha, in her arms, repaired to {%A.; A%}. cast off his bow,
and asked after Suratha (the son of Jayadratha); she said
that he had died from sorrow when he heard of {%A.'s%} arrival;
{%A%}. comforted her; Duḥśalā asked her warriors to desist, and
returned home; at last the horse arrived at Maṇipūra—
{@79@}, 2338—where Babhruvāhana, {%A.'s%} son by Citrāṅgadā,
approached {%A%}. with humility; {%A%}. angrily blamed him for
having fallen away from kṣattriya duties. Ulūpī pierced
through the earth and beheld her [step-]son standing distressed,
and incited him to fight {%A.%}, which he did; he even caused
the sacrificial horse to be seized; gravely wounded, {%A%}. praised
his son highly; at last {%A%}. fell down in a swoon, and so did
Babhruvāhana. {@80@}, 2371: Citrāṅgadā lamented. At last
Ulūpī thought of the gem that has the virtue of reviving
a dead man; the gem came; she placed it on the breast
of {%A.%}; he revived. {@81@}, (2402): Asked by {%A.%}, Ulūpī
recited the curse of the Vasus for {%A.'s%} having slain Bhīṣma
in unfair fight; if {%A%}. had died without having expiated his
sin, he would have fallen into Hell; {%A%}. highly approved of
her deed and told Babhruvāhana to come with his mother,
etc., to the horse-sacrifice; Babhruvāhana promised to come
and to take upon himself the task of distributing food among
the brahmans. He asked {%A%}. to pass the night in the city
with his two wives; but {%A%}. was prevented by his vow of
following the horse. {@82@}, 2456, 2462: The horse at last
[Page085-b+ 63]
turned its face towards Hāstinapura; at Rājagṛha, the
Magadha king Meghasandhi, the son of Sahadeva, mounted on
his chariot, attacked {%A.%}, who was on foot; he was told to come
to the horse-sacrifice. In Vaṅga, Puṇḍra, and Kośala {%A%}.

son of Ekalavya, was vanquished after a furious battle, etc.
King Ugrasena came to {%A%}. with Vasudeva. Then along the
coast of the western ocean; then to the Gāndhāras, where
a fierce battle ensued with the Gāndhāra king, the son of
Śakuni. {@84@}, 2491: At last the king, disregarding {%A.'s%} peaceful
advice, fought alone; {%A%}. shot off his headgear; the mother
of the king came out and forbade her son to fight; {%A%}. told
him to come to the horse-sacrifice. {@85@}, 2511: At the news
of his arrival to Hāstinapura, Yudhiṣṭhira rejoiced, etc., and
made magnificent preparations for the sacrifice. {@86@}, 2559:

much emaciated, and that he was near at hand. {@87@}, 2587, 2592,
2593: Yudhiṣṭhira enquired of Kṛṣṇa why {%A%}. was fated to
bear such hardships in life; Kṛṣṇa attributed it to the elevation
of {%A.'s%} cheekbones. Bhīmasena, etc., became gratified with
{%A.'s%} triumphs. A messenger announced the arrival of {%A.%},
and received large gifts. On the second day {%A%}. entered the
city (description). {%A%}. saluted Yudhiṣṭhira, etc. {@88@}: The
sacrifice was duly performed; {@89@}, 2655.—§ 786 (do.), XIV,
{@91@}, 2814: “Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīma, and {%A%}. resembled Indra.”
—§ 787 (Āśramavāsap.), XV, {@1@}: For fifteen years the
Pāṇḍavas did everything under the advice of Dhṛtarāṣṭra;
Bhīmasena alone did not forget his grievances. {@2@}: From
fear of Yudhiṣṭhira nobody dared to speak evil of Duryo-
dhana or Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Bhīma, however, reverenced the old
king outwardly, but with a very unwilling heart. {@3@}: After
fifteen years Dhṛtarāṣṭra, afflicted by the cutting words of
Bhīma, asked Yudhiṣṭhira's permission for himself and
Gāndhārī to retire to the woods clad in rags and barks in order
to practise austerities; {@10@}, 333, 346. {@11@}: Yudhiṣṭhira
and {%A%}. applauded Dhṛtarāṣṭra's intention to perform the
śrāddha of Bhīṣma, etc., before setting out for the woods;
Bhīma was unwilling; {%A%}. sought to pacify him, seconded by
Yudhiṣṭhira. {@12@}, (382), 387, 392: {%A%}. urged Bhīma to
forget the injuries of Duryodhana. {@13@}, 403: Vidura reported
the speeches of Yudhiṣṭhira, {%A.%}, and Bhīma to Dhṛtarāṣṭra.
{@15@}, 434: When Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Gāndhārī set out with his
daughters-in-law on the day of full-moon in the month of
Kārttika, Yudhiṣṭhira and {%A%}. were filled with grief.
{@16@}, 455: Vidura and Sañjaya and Kuntī retired with Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra and Gāndhārī into the woods; Dhṛtarāṣṭra caused Kṛpa
and Yuyutsu to remain and made them over to Yudhiṣṭhira.—
§ 788 (do.), XV, {@22@}: Afflicted with grief, the Pāṇḍavas
did not attend to their kingly offices; they set their heart
upon seeing Dhṛtarāṣṭra, etc., and proceeded towards the
forest. {@23@}, 618, 628: Headed by {%A%}. (on a chariot with white
horses) and Kṛpa, they proceeded slowly (description of the
expedition). {@24@}, 646: Sahadeva and Kuntī informed

to see the Pāṇḍavas, Sañjaya pointed out each of them
(γ). {@26@}: Vidura entered the body of Yudhiṣṭhira, but
was not cremated; {@28@}, 747 (ε).—§ 789 (Putradarśanap.),
XV, {@29@}: The Pāṇḍavas passed about a month in that
[Page086-a+ 63]
forest; Vyāsa came; Dhṛtarāṣṭra wished to see his dead
children and kinsmen; the grief of Gāndhārī, etc. (δ), was
revived; she said that for sixteen years Dhṛtarāṣṭra never
slept for grief; and also Kṛṣṇā, etc. (ε), grieved exceedingly;
asked by Vyāsa to tell what she wiṣed—{@30@}—Kuntī told
the story of Karṇa's birth; Vyāsa promised to show her
Karṇa. {@31@}: They all proceeded towards the Bhāgīrathī,
and waited for the advent of night; at sunset they
bathed and finished their evening rites. {@32@}: When night
came, Vyāsa plunged into the Bhāgīrathī for a bath and
summoned all the deceased warriors, who all rose up from
the water with a loud uproar. {@33@}: When they had sported
with one another for that night, Vyāsa dismissed them within
the twinkling of an eye.—§ 791 (do.), XV, {@36@}, 1004 (β):
Dhṛtarāṣṭra became released from his grief; all returned
home; the Pāṇḍavas had passed more than a month in the
wood.—§ 792 (Nāradāgamanap.), XV, {@37—39@}: Two years
later the Pāṇḍavas were visited by Nārada, who told them
that Dhṛtarāṣṭra, etc., had been burnt by a forest con-
flagration; only Sañjaya had escaped. The Pāṇḍavas and
the citizens all proceeded to Gaṅgā in order to offer oblations
of water to them, etc.—§ 793 (Mausalap.), XVI, {@4@}, †107:
After the mutual slaughter at Dvārakā, Kṛṣṇa sent Dāruka
to inform {%A%}. and tell him to come quickly; Kṛṣṇa, entering
Dvāravatī, told his father to protect the ladies till {%A%}. came.
Bala-Rāma and Kṛṣṇa died. {@5@}, 135, 138: {%A%}. with Dāruka
proceeded to Dvārakā; when Kṛṣṇa's 16,000 wives saw {%A.%},
they uttered a loud cry. The city seemed to {%A%}. to be like the
terrible river Vaitaraṇī. {%A.%}, Satyā, and Rukmiṇī fell down
and wailed; then praising Kṛṣṇa and comforting the ladies,
{%A%}. went to Vasudeva. {@6@}κ, 151, 153, 154, 157, 169: Vasu-
deva lamented and said he would die by abstaining from food.
{@7@}, 183, 224, 227, 230, 253: {%A%}. said that the hour had come
also for the Pāṇḍavas to depart [from the world] (λ);
he would, however, first move the women, the children, and
the aged of the Vṛṣṇis to Indraprastha. Then he entered
the hall of the Yādavas called Sudharmā ({%sudharmāṃ yādavīṃ%}
{%sabhāṃ%}), where he told the citizens and ministers that he
would take away with him the remnants of the Vṛṣṇis and
Andhakas, as the sea would soon engulf the city, etc. {%A%}.
passed that night in the mansion of Kṛṣṇa. At dawn Vasu-
deva by yoga attained to the highest goal; his four wives
ascended the funeral pyre. When {%A%}. had caused Vasudeva
and his four wives to be burnt, he visited the place where the
Vṛṣṇis had been slaughtered, and caused the last rites to be
performed and Rāma and Kṛṣṇa to be burnt. On the
seventh day he set out with the ladies and children, the Yādava
troops and other inhabitants, with Kṛṣṇa's 16,000 wives,
and Vajra; they numbered many millions in all; then the
ocean flooded Dvārakā; they proceeded in slow marches;
at Pañcanada the Ābhīras (Mlecchas) conspired to rob the
cavalcade. {%A%}. only with great difficulty succeeded in
stringing his bow. His celestial weapons would not come
to his mind; the women were snatched away by the robbers;
{%A.'s%} shafts soon became exhausted; formerly they had been
inexhaustible. {%A%}. became very distressed; he escorted the
remnant of the cavalcade to Kurukṣetra; he established
the son of Kṛtavarman in the city of Mārttikāvata with the
remnant of the women of the Bhoja king; the remainder,
with children and old men and women, at Indraprastha with
Vajra for their ruler; the son of Yuyudhāna (with old men,
etc.) on the banks of the Sarasvatī, etc.; then {%A%}. entered the
retreat of Vyāsa. {@8@}, 254, 255, (261): {%A%}. informed Vyāsa of
[Page086-b+ 62]
what had passed (ν) (“500,000 warriors have thus been laid
down”). Vyāsa said that Kṛṣṇa, as also the Pāṇḍavas,
had finished their work; “the time has come for your
departure from this world,” etc. (ξ). {%A%}. entered Hāstinapura
and informed Yudhiṣṭhira of what had taken place.—§ 794
(Mahāprasthān.), XVII, {@1@}, 2, 5, 20, 31, 37, 38: The
Pāṇḍavas set their heart on leaving the world; the kingdom
was made over to Yuyutsu, and Parikṣit installed as king in
Hāstinapura, while Vajra ruled in Indraprastha. Kṛpa was
installed as the preceptor of Parikṣit. The subjects tried
in vain to dissuade them; they and Draupadī divested them-
selves of their ornaments and dressed in the barks of trees;
then they threw their sacred fires into the water. Then they
set out on their journey: the five Pāṇḍavas, Draupadī, and
a dog; wandering towards the east they reached the sea of
red water. Agni came (α) and caused {%A%}. to throw the
Gāṇḍīva and his inexhaustible quiver into the water and
thus restore them to Varuṇa. They now proceeded towards
the south, etc., wishing to make a round of the whole earth.
{@2@}, 67: Having crossed Himavat, etc., Kṛṣṇā dropped down,
in consequence of her partiality for {%A.%}; then Sahadeva, then
Nakula, then {%A%}. fell down; {%A.%}, because he had said that
he would consume all the foes in a single day, but had
not accomplished it. {@3@}, 92: Yudhiṣṭhira's second test.
—§ 795 (Svargārohaṇap.), XVIII, {@1—3@}: Yudhiṣṭhira's
third test: {@2@}, 36, 66. {@4@}, [128: When arrived in heaven
