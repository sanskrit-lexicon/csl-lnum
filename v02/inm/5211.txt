{@Kalmāṣapāda@},¦ Saudāsa (also named Mitrasaha), king of
Ayodhyā and husband of Madayantī. § 188 (Madayantī):
[Page377-b+ 63]
I, {@122@}, 4737 (being himself unable to beget children
{%K%}. urged Madayantī to go to Vasiṣṭha, who begat Aśmaka on
her, cf. § 225).—§ 224 (Vāsiṣṭha): The rājarṣi of the
race of {%Ikṣvāku Kalmāṣapāda%} (whose sacrifices {%Viśvāmitra%}
had desired to perform) once when hunting met the viprarṣi
{%Śaktri%}, the eldest of Vasiṣṭha's 100 sons, and ordered
him to stand out of his way, and as {%Śaktri%} did not yield
{%K%}. struck him with his whip. {%Śaktri%} then cursed him, saying:
“From this day thou shalt be a {%rākṣasa%}, eating human
flesh.” The king began humbly to propitiate the ṛṣi, but
{%Viśvāmitra%} (between whom and Vasiṣṭha there was a dispute
about {%K.%}, whom they both wanted as their yājya) passed before
them without being seen, and caused a {%rākṣasa%} named {%Kiṅkara%}
to enter the king. {%Viśvāmitra%} then went away. At this time
a hungry brahman beheld in the wood {%K.%}, who was terribly
afflicted by the {%rākṣasa%}, and asked the king for some food
with meat. {%K%}. asked him to stay there for a moment, and
having roved for some time at pleasure at last entered his
inner apartments. When waking at midnight and remembering
his promise, he summoned his cook, and as the cook did not
find any meat {%K%}. said: “Feed him with human flesh.”
The cook then took human flesh from the place where the
executioners were, and offered it to the hungry brahman.
Seeing with his spiritual power of vision ({%siddha-cakṣuṣā%})
what kind of food it was, the brahman in anger said that the
king himself should take a fancy to such food and wander
over all the earth alarming all creatures. The curse on the
king, being thus repeated a second time, became very strong,
and possessed by the {%rākṣasa%} the king lost all his senses.
A while after {%K.%}, beholding {%Śaktri%}, in order to revenge him-
self for the curse slew him and ate him up. And {%Viśvāmitra%}
caused that {%rākṣasa%} also to devour the other sons of Vasiṣṭha:
I, {@176@}, 6696 ({%Ikṣvākuvaṃśajaḥ%}), [6720 ({%Mitrasahaḥ%} B., C. has
{%mitrasahaṃ%} as adj. to {%dvijaṃ%})].—§ 225 (Vāsiṣṭha): I, {@177@},
6761, 6768 (Vasiṣṭha delivered {%K%}. from the curse of Śaktri,
and then at the request of {%K%}. begat Aśmaka on Madayantī,
the queen of {%K%}.).—§ 228 (Aurvop.): I, {@181@}, 6881 (attained
to heaven).—§ 229 (Vasiṣṭhop.): I, {@182@}, 6888, 6904

a son on his wife).—[§ 480 (Pativratop., Brāhmaṇavyā-
dhasaṃv.): III, {@208@}, 13817 ({%Saudāsena%}, all. to § 224).]—
§ 607 (Karṇap.): VIII, {@45@}, 2092 ({%Rākṣasaḥ%}, a sentence of
his is quoted; read with B. {%K°aḥ sarasi%}, instead of {%K°asarasi%}).
—[§ 638{%b%} (Rāmopākhyāna): XII, {@49@}, 1792 ({%dāyādaḥ Saudā-%}
{%sasya…Sarvakarmā%}, had been protected by Parāśara).]—
[§ 723 (Ānuśāsanik.): XIII, {@6@}α, 326 ({%Kośalādhipaḥ…%}

{%Mitrasahaś cāpi Vasiṣṭhāya mahātmane Madayantīṃ%} ({%Dama°%},
C.) {%priyāṃ dattvā tayā saha divaṃ gataḥ%}, cf. § 225).]—[§ 746
(do.): XIII, {@78@}, 3732 ({%Ikṣvākuvaṃśajo rājā Saudāsaḥ%}),
(3734) ({%Saudāsaḥ%}, questioned Vasiṣṭha about kine).]—
§ 767 (Ānuśāsanik.): XIII, {@137@}α, 6262 ({%rājā Mitrasahaḥ%}).]—
[§ 784{%b%} (Uttaṅka): XIV, {@56@}, 1654 ({%Saudāsapatnī°%}), 1656
({%Saudāsaṃ puruṣādaṃ%}); {@57@}, (1672) ({%Saudāsaḥ%}), (1674) (do.),
(1679) (do.), 1681 ({%Saudāsa°%}); {@58@}, 1690 ({%Mitrasahaṃ%}),
