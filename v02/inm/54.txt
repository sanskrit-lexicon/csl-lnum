{@Āśāvaha@}<sup>1</sup>:¦ I, {@3@}, 42 (Anukram.): according to the expla-
nation of Nīlakaṇṭha, either a synonym of Vāyu (the wind),
the tenth of the twelve sons (i.e. “representations,” Nīl.) of
Heaven (Dyaus) (= Māyā, Nīl.) and Vivasvat (i.e. Brahman,
Nīl.), viz., the geniuses of the ten senses and Mind ({%manas%})
together with Mahya (B. {%Sahya%}, i.e. Manu, Nīl.), who are
all manifestations of the one “Son of Heaven” ({%divaḥ%}
{%putro%}),—or (more probably) a Vivasvat or form of the Sun
({%“Vivasvataḥ”%} being then an irregular nom. plur.; but
B. has {%putrā%} instead of {%purā%}).
