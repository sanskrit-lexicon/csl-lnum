[{@Hradapraveśaparvan@}]¦ (“the section containing Duryo-
dhana's entering the lake,” the 81st of the minor parvans
of Mhbhr.; cf. Hradapraveśana). § 612: The followers
of {%Śakuni%} attacked the {%Pāṇḍavas; Arjuna%} and {%Bhīmasena%}
came to the rescue of {%Sahadeva; Arjuna%} slew them; {%Duryo-%}
{%dhana%} rallied the remnants of his chariots (many hundreds),
etc., and urged them against the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%};
they were exterminated in a moment by the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and
the {%Sṛñjayas%}. Only {%Duryodhana%} remained alive. Requested
by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya%} recounted the numbers of the
remnants of the {%Pāṇḍava%} army. {%Duryodhana%} abandoned his
slain steeds and fled away on foot without a companion,
towards a lake, taking up his mace, recalling the words of
[Page325-b+ 63]
{%Vidura%}. The {%Pāṇḍavas%} (headed by {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}) with
{%Arjuna%} (with {%Gāṇḍīva%}) baffled the {%Kurus%}. In {%Duryodhana's%}
army no great chariot-warrior was alive save {%Aśvatthāman%},
etc. (α). Urged by {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Sātyaki%} was about to
slay {%Sañjaya%}; but {%Vyāsa%} came and caused him to be let off
alive. He met with {%Duryodhana%}, whom he told the state of
things, and who asked him to inform {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}. Then
{%Duryodhana%}, having charmed the waters, entered the lake.
{%Sañjaya%} then met with {%Aśvatthāman%}, etc. (α), and informed
them; they fled away, at sight of the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, to the {%Kuru%}
camp, taking {%Sañjaya%} up in the chariot of {%Kṛpa%}. The sun
had set a little before. The outposts of the camp wept
aloud. The old men proceeded towards the city with the
princesses (description); also the camp-guards fled towards
the city, and so did also the cowherds, etc., from fear of
{%Bhīmasena. Yuyutsu%} reflected (β). With the permission of
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} he supervised the removal of the ladies. The
sun was setting. Having entered {%Hāstinapura%} with the
ladies, he informed {%Vidura%} (γ); urged by {%Vidura%}, he passed
that night in his own abode, while {%Vidura%} went to the
cheerless mansion of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} (IX, {@29@}). Requested by
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} (δ), {%Sañjaya%} related: The {%Pāṇḍavas%} wandered
over the field in search of {%Duryodhana%}; tired, they took rest
in their camp with all their soldiers. Then {%Aśvatthāman%}, etc.
(α) proceeded towards the lake and urged {%Duryodhana%} to fight
with them against {%Yudhiṣṭhira. Duryodhana%} said that he
would rest for that night and fight the next morning.
{%Aśvatthāman%} swore to slay the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and all the {%Pāñcālas%}
in this night. Certain hunters who used every day to procure
a basketful of meat for {%Bhīmasena%} overheard the conversation
between {%Duryodhana%} and {%Aśvatthāman%}, etc. (α), and informed
{%Bhīmasena%}. The {%Pāṇḍavas%} all ({%Arjuna%}, etc. (ε) with {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%}) started towards the lake ({%Dvaipāyana%}); hearing the
noise caused by them {%Aśvatthāman%}, etc. (α), took leave from
{%Duryodhana%} and went away, and stopped under a banyan
(IX, {@30@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} advised {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to slay {%Duryodhana%}
by putting forth his own powers of illusion (ζ). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
tauntingly addressed {%Duryodhana%} for having fled from battle
(η); {%Duryodhana%} said that he had entered the lake not
from fear, but in order to take rest. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked
{%Duryodhana%} to come out immediately and fight his foes.
He answered that his kingdom might be taken by his foes,
his own desire being to enter the woods and retire from the
world (θ); {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} taunted him for such an answer,
refusing to take the kingdom in gift from one who was
unable to retain it by might (IX, {@31@}).
