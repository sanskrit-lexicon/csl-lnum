[{@Haraṇāharaṇaparvan@}]¦ (“the section relating to the
handing over the gift of honour,” the 17th of the minor
parvans of the Mhbhr.). § 253: {%Kṛṣṇa%} said that {%Arjuna%}
had not insulted their family, but had rather enhanced their
respect, and prevailed upon them that they, by conciliation,
brought {%Arjuna%} back to {%Dvārakā%}, where he was united in
marriage with {%Subhadrā%} and passed a whole year. The last
time of his exile he passed in {%Puṣkara%}. After the twelve
years were complete he came back to {%Khāṇḍavaprastha%}.
{%Draupadī%} at first was jealous, but then embraced {%Subhadrā%}.
{%Kṛṣṇa%} visited them at {%Indraprastha%} with {%Rāma, Akrūra%}
{%Dānapati%} (the {%senāpati%} of the {%Vṛṣṇis%}), {%Anādhṛṣṭi, Uddhava%}
(a disciple of {%Bṛhaspati%} himself), {%Satyaka%} and {%Sātyaki%}, and
{%Kṛtavarman Sātvata%}, and {%Pradyumna, Śāmba, Niśaṭha, Śaṅku%},
{%Cārudeṣṇa, Jhillin, Vipṛthu, Sāraṇa, Gada%}, etc., bringing
with them many nuptial presents. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} sent the
twins out to receive them. {%Kṛṣṇa%} gave them 10,000 kine
from the country of {%Mathurā%}, and {%Bālhika%} horses as {%kanyādhana%},
etc. {%Rāma%} gave {%Arjuna%} as a wedding present ({%pāṇigrahaṇika%})
1,000 elephants. Having spent many days in sports and
merriment there, the {%Vṛṣṇis%} returned to {%Dvāravatī%} with
{%Rāma%} in the van, carrying with them the gems that had been
given them by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}. But {%Kṛṣṇa%} remained with
{%Arjuna%} at {%Indrapraṣtha%}, and they went a-hunting over the
borders of the {%Yamunā. Subhadrā%} brought forth {%Abhimanyu%}, so
called because he was fearless ({%abhī%}) and wrathful ({%manyumat%},
v. 8027). Upon his birth {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} gave away 10,000
kine and {%niṣkas%} to the {%brahmans%}. The child became the
favourite of {%Vāsudeva%}, etc., and acquired from his father the
{%Dhanurveda (b).—Pāñcalī%} ({%Kṛṣṇā%}, v. 8045) also obtained
five sons (see § 159): {%Prativindhya, Sutasoma, Śrutakarman%},
{%Śatānīka, Śrutasena%}. They were born each at the interval of
one year. Their {%jātakarman, cūḍa%}, and {%upanayana%} were
performed by {%Dhaumya%}. After having studied the {%Vedas%} they
acquired from {%Arjuna%} knowledge of all weapons celestial and
human (I, {@221@}).
