{@[Pavan-Ārjuna—saṃvāda]@}¦ (“conversation between the
[Page549-a+ 63]
Wind and Arjuna Kārtavīrya”). § 772{%b%} (Ānuśāsanik.):
{%Bhīṣma%} said: The {%Haihaya%} king {%Arjuna Kārtavīrya%}, with
1,000 arms, became the lord of the whole of this world
(i.e. the earth) [residing] in {%Māhiṣmatī%}; he gave large
gifts to {%Dattātreya%}, who granted him four boons: that he
should have 1,000 arms in battle, but only two at home; that
he should subjugate the whole earth righteously, and sway her
with vigilance; and that whenever he might happen to go
wrong, the righteous should set him right. {%A%}. now regarded
himself as having no equal. A celestial voice said that
the brahman is superior to the {%kṣatriya; A%}. maintained
that the brahmans take refuge with the {%kṣatriyas%}; what
the virgin {%Gāyatrī%} had said from the sky was not true
({%asatyaṃ%}, so B. and Nīl.). “I shall bring the skin-clad
brahmans under my subjection.” At these words of {%A%}. the
invisible goddess ({%Gāyatrī%}) became agitated ({%vitrastā 'bhūn%}
{%niśācarī%}; cf. Nīl.). Then {%Vāyu%} (wind) warned {%A.%}, addressing
him from the air. Asked by {%A%}. what kind of earthly
creature the brahman is, if he resembles the wind, water,
fire, sun, or sky (XIII, {@153@}), {%Vāyu%} praised the brahmans
above all, citing {%Kaśyapa (c), Aṅgiras (d), Gautama (e%}),
{%[Kapila] (f), Aurva (g%}), and {%Dattātreya%}; even {%Agni (h%}) and
{%Brahmán (i%}) are brahmans; the large kingdom of the
{%Daṇḍakas%} was destroyed by a brahman; the ocean, that was
full of crystal water, cursed by the brahmans, became saline
in taste. {%Arjuna%} remained silent (XIII, {@154@}). {%Vāyu%} repeated
the story of {%Kaśyapa%} in detail, and asked {%Arjuna%} if he knew
a {%kṣatriya%} superior to {%Kaśyapa. Arjuna%} remained silent.
Then {%Vāyu%} related the story of {%Utathya (j%}) (XIII, {@155@}).
{%Arjuna%} remained silent. {%Vāyu%} then described the greatness
of {%Agastya (k). Arjuna%} remained silent. {%Vāyu%} related a feat
of {%Vasiṣṭha's (l%}) (XIII, {@156@}). {%Arjuna%} remained silent.
{%Vāyu%} related a feat of {%Atri's (m). Arjuna%} remained silent.
{%Vāyu%} related a feat of {%Cyavana's (n%}) (XIII, {@157@}). {%Arjuna%}
remained silent. {%Vāyu%} related the history of the {%Kapas%}
({%p). Arjuna%} praised the brahmans, mentioning {%Dattātreya%}.
{%Vāyu%} told him always to protect them; “a terrible danger
threatens thee from the {%Bhṛgus%}; that will take place after
a time” (XIII, {@158@}).
