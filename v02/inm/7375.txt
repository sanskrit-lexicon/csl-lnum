{@Mṛtyu@}<sup>4</sup>¦ (“Death”), fem. § 594 (Akampana): Nārada said
to Akampana: In the beginning the Grandsire {%Brahmán%}
created all creatures. As the creation bore no sign of
decay, he began to think about the destruction of the
universe. Failing to find any means of destruction, he
became angry, and in consequence of his anger a fire sprang
from the apertures of his body ({%khebhyaḥ%}) and destroyed
all creatures. Then {%Śiva%} (the lord of all the wanderers
at night) appealed to {%Brahmán%} (the greatest of ascetics),
who said, “Thou hast been born out of our wish” ({%kāmāt%})
(VII, {@52@}), and that the Earth, afflicted with the heavy
weight of creatures, had asked him to destroy them. {%Śiva%},
saying that he had been appointed by {%Brahmán%} the protector
of creatures, prevailed upon {%Brahmán%} to keep his wrath
within his own inner self and extinguish the fire. Then
{%Brahmán%} expounded the doctrine of {%pravṛtti%} and {%nivṛtti%}.
From his organs of sense ({%gobhyaḥ%}, cf. {%khebhyaḥ%} in a parallel
passage, XII, 9179) then issued a female who was dark, etc.,
and set out for the southern quarter; {%Brahmán%} called her
Death ({%Mṛtyu%}) and told her to slay the creatures. She wept,
but {%Brahmán%} caught her tears with his two hands and
implored her (VII, {@53@})—who wished to go to the hermitage
of {%Dhenuka%} to perform austerities—to slay the creatures.
Soon {%Brahmán%} smiled, the creatures continued to live as
before, and {%Mṛtyu%} proceeded to {%Dhenuka%}, where she practised
austere vows during twenty-one times ten billions of years,
and then she wandered 10,000 billions of years with the
creatures. Next she repaired to {%Nandā%} and there passed
8,000 years, and became purified from all her sins. Then she
went to {%Kauśikī%}, where she lived upon air and water only.
Then she repaired to {%Pañcagaṅgā%} and next to {%Vetasaka%} (C. {%Ce°%}),
then to the {%Gaṅgā%} and thence to {%Meru%}, motionless and
suspending her life-breaths. Thence to the top of {%Himavat%}
(where the gods had performed sacrifices) for a billion of
years standing on the toe only of her feet. Then to
{%Puṣkara%}, and {%Gokarṇa%}, and {%Naimiṣa%}, and {%Malaya%}, with
steady devotion to the Grandsire without acknowledging any
other god. {%Brahmán%} was gratified with her and said that
in slaying the creatures she should be without sin; {%Yama%} and
the diseases should become her helpmates. She prevailed
upon him that the passions, covetousness, etc., should tear
the bodies of the creatures before she slew them. Her
tears which were in his hands should become diseases
springing from the creatures themselves and kill men; she
should be the virtue of living creatures and the goddess of
this virtue. Sin would slay those who were of wicked
behaviour; “it will be thy work to sink them in their sins that
are wicked.” Nārada further expounded the nature of death
and told Akampana not to grieve for his dead son: VII,
