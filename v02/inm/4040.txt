[{@Gaṅgāvataraṇa(ṃ)@}]¦ (“descent of the Gaṅgā”). § 389
(Sagara): Asked by {%Sagara%} to bring back the horse and
deliver him from hell ({%Narakād), Aṃśumat%} went to the spot
where the earth had been excavated, entered the sea by that
very way, and beheld {%Kapila%} and the horse. As he bowed
his head before {%Kapila%}, etc., {%Kapila%} granted him the horse,
and that his fathers should be purified and go to heaven,
when his son's son, by the favour of {%Śiva%}, brought {%Tripathagā%}
(i.e. Gaṅgā) from heaven. When he had brought the horse
back to the sacrificial yard and narrated all the events to
{%Sagara, Sagara%} grieved no more, but praised {%Aṃśumat%} and
finished the sacrificial rites. {%Sagara%} was greeted by all the
gods and converted the sea into a son of himself ({%putratve%}
{%kalpayām āsa%}), and after a long reign placed his grandson on
the throne and ascended to heaven. {%Aṃśumat%} ruled the
whole earth like {%Sagara%}, and died after he had placed his son
[Page299-b+ 63]
{%Dilīpa%} on the throne. {%Dilīpa%} in vain tried to effect the
descent of {%Gaṅgā%} in order to raise his forefathers. He then
anointed his son {%Bhagīratha%} as king, and practised austerities
in the forest, and then ascended to heaven (III, {@107@}).
{%Bhagīratha%} made over his kingly duties to his minister
({%sacive%}), and ({%b%}) practised austerities on the {%Himavat%} during
1000 celestial years, living upon fruits, roots, and water.
Then {%Gaṅgā Haimavatī%} appeared in a material form
({%mūrtimatī%}), and promised to besprinkle the bodies of his
forefathers and carry them to heaven, and as there existed
none in the three worlds except {%Śiva%}, who was able to sustain
her fall, she caused {%Bhagīratha%} to go to {%Kailāsa%}, where he, by
his austerities, obtained the favour of {%Śiva%} (III, {@108@}), who,
surrounded by his awful attendants ({%pāriṣadaiḥ%}), came to
{%Himavat%}. There he caused {%Bhagīratha%} to pray to {%Gaṅgā%}.
{%Gaṅgā%} immediately came down from the sky, in the presence
of the gods, {%maharṣis, Gandharvas, snakes%}, and {%Yakṣas%}, and
{%Śiva%} received her on his forehead, whence she fell to the
earth, divided into three streams. At her request {%Bhagīratha%}
led her to the spot where the bodies of {%Sagara's%} sons lay,
while {%Śiva%} went to {%Kailāsa%} with the celestials. {%Gaṅgā%} filled
the sea, and {%Bhagīratha%} adopted her as his daughter and
offered libations of water to his forefathers (III, {@109@}).
