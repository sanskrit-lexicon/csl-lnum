accept her as his wife, because he, being a disciple of Uśanas,
regarded her as his sister; {%D%}. then cursed {%Kaca%}).—§ 146:
When {%Kaca%} had imparted to the gods the {%Sañjīvanī%} they set
out with {%Indra%} at their head to defeat the {%Asuras%}. In a wood
like {%Caitraratha, Indra%} transformed himself into wind and
mixed up the clothes of some bathing maidens. A quarrel
about the clothes resulted in {%D.'s%} being thrown into a well
by {%Śarmiṣṭhā%}, the daughter of {%Vṛṣaparvan. Yayāti%} found
her and drew her up by her right hand, and then returned
to his capital. {%Devayānī%} sent {%Ghūrṇikā%} to inform {%Śukra%}
of what had passed (I, {@78—79@}). {%Śukra%} threatened {%Vṛṣa-%}
{%parvan%} that he would leave the Asuras, until {%Śarmiṣṭhā%},
together with 1,000 maidens, was given to {%D%}. (I, {@80@}).
Surrounded by {%Śarmiṣṭhā%} and 2,000 maidens, {%Devayānī%} one
day again met {%Yayāti%}, who at her request received her

invite {%Śarmiṣṭhā%} to share his bed (I, {@81@}): I, {@78@}, 3284, 3285,

§ 147: {%Devayānī%} gave birth to a son. After 1,000 years had
elapsed, {%Śarmiṣṭhā%} attained to puberty and prevailed upon
Yayāti to beget a son also with her (I, {@82@}); to {%Devayānī%}
she said that she had born the child to a {%ṛṣi%} whose
name she had not dared to ask. The sons of {%Devayānī%} were
{%Yadu%} and {%Turvasu%}, those of {%Śarmiṣṭhā%} were {%Druhyu, Anu%},
and {%Pūru%}. One day, when {%Devayānī%} was walking in the
wood together with {%Yayāti%}, she met the children of
{%Śarmiṣṭhā%} and asked them: “Who is your father?” They
then pointed to {%Yayāti. Devayānī%} in anger withdrew to
{%Uśanas%}, followed by {%Yayāti. Uśanas%} cursed {%Yayāti%} to be
overcome by decrepitude, yet with the permission of trans-
ferring it to someone else, and he added that that son of
{%Yayāti%} who would give him his own youth should succeed
{%Yayāti%} on the throne, etc. (I, {@83@}): I, {@82@}, 3397, 3398, 3400,
