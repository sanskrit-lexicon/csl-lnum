{@Pramadvarā@},¦ wife of Ruru. § 19 (Paulomap.): I, {@5@}, 872
(wife of Ruru and mother of Śunaka).—§ 21 (cf. Paulomap.):
{%Menakā%} dropped her child by {%Viśvāvasu, P%}. near the hermitage
of {%Sthūlakeśa%}, who took it up and reared it. {%P%}. was betrothed
to {%Ruru%}, but a few days before the nuptials she was killed
by a snake: I, {@8@}, 940, 950, 951, 953.—§ 22 (do.): Svastyā-
treya, etc. (α), (the inhabitants of the forest) came to
see her (I, {@8@}).—§ 23 (do.): {%Ruru%} retired into a deep wood
and, weeping aloud, cried to the gods to resuscitate {%P%}. A
{%devadūta%} (messenger of the gods) told him to resign to her
half of his own life, which he did. Then the king of the
{%Gandharvas%} (i.e. Viśvāvasu) and the {%devadūta%} obtained from
Dharma the favour that {%P%}. revived endued with a moiety of
Ruru's life; then they were married and became happy:
I, {@9@}, 965, 968, 972, 974, 976, 977, 978.—§ 736{%b%} (Vītahavyop.):
XIII, {@30@}, 2004 (mother of Śunaka).
