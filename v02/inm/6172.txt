[{@Kuṇḍalāharaṇaparvan@}¦ (“the section relating to the
taking away of the ear-rings”)], the fiftieth of the minor parvans
of Mhbhr.—§ 546: Asked by Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana
related how Indra removed Yudhiṣṭhira's fear of Karṇa, as
he had promised to Yudhiṣṭhira through Lomaśa: In the
thirteenth year of the exile of the Pāṇḍavas, Indra resolved,
in the guise of a brahman, to ask Karṇa for his ear-rings
(sprung from amṛta) and mail for the benefit of Arjuna.
[Page435-b+ 63]
Sūrya then came to Karṇa in a dream and dissuaded him
from giving them. “There is beside some mystery which
you will understand in time.” Karṇa refused to break his
vow always to give to brahmans and confided in the weapons
which he had obtained from Rāma Jāmadagnya and Droṇa.
Sūrya then prevailed upon him to beseech Indra to give him
a dart (III, {@300—2@}).—§ 547: Karṇa (q.v.).
