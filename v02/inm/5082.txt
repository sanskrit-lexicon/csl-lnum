{@Kairātaparvan@}¦ (“the section treating of the Kirāta”),
the 33rd of the minor parvans of Mhbhr., forming an episode
to Arjuna's journey to the abode of Indra (cf. Kairāta).
§ 331. It is anew related how {%Arjuna%} set out from the
{%Kāmyaka%} wood towards the north; he entered a terrible
forest (description), resorted to by {%Siddhas%} and {%Cāraṇas%}, and
then proceeded to the {%Himavat%} (description). For four months
he practised austerities (specified), until the {%ṛṣis%} made
representations about it to {%Śiva%}, who dismissed them after
having removed their fears (III, {@38@}). Then {%Śiva%} with his
bow and arrows, in the guise of a {%Kirāta%}, accompanied by
{%Umā%} in the guise of a {%Kirāta%} woman, by merry spirits
({%bhūtaiḥ%}), and thousands of women, approached {%Arjuna%} as he
was about to kill {%Mūka%}, a son of {%Danu%}, who in the form of
a boar would have killed {%Arjuna. Arjuna%} and {%Śiva%} at the
same time pierced {%Mūka%} with their arrows, and killed him;
when dying he again assumed his {%rākṣasa%} form; then they
fought against each other, first with arrows, then with the
very bows, then with swords, then with trees and stones,
then with the fists, and then by clasping each other; at last
{%Arjuna%} lost his senses, and was almost reduced to a ball of
flesh; when he regained consciousness he made a clay image
of {%Śiva%}, which he worshipped with a garland, which then
appeared on the head of the {%Kirāta%}; he thus learned that
it was {%Śiva%}, and prostrated himself at his feet. {%Śiva%} declared
that {%Arjuna's%} prowess was equal to his own, promised to give
him his weapon, and gave him ‘eye’ ({%cakṣus%}), so that he
beheld him in his true form, together with {%Umā%}.—§ 332:
{%Arjuna%} then fell on his knees and worshipped him, saying:
“O {%Kapardin!%} etc.” (v. {%Mahādevastava%}) (III, {@39@}).—§ 333:
Śiva said that {%Arjuna (b%}) was in a former life {%Nara%}, etc.
When granted a boon, {%Arjuna%} asked {%Śiva%} to give him the
{%Pāśupata%} weapon named {%Brahmaśiras (c%}). Having purified
himself he was instructed in its use on the condition that he
should not hurl it against a human being, for then it would
destroy the universe. The earth trembled, etc. The gods
and {%Dānavas%} beheld the weapon in its bodily shape standing
by the side of {%Arjuna%}. When {%Arjuna%} had been touched by
{%Śiva%}, all that was evil in his body was dispelled. Having
said to {%Arjuna%}, “Go thou into heaven,” {%Śiva%} went up into
the skies accompanied by {%Umā%} (III, {@40@}).—§ 334: Then
{%Arjuna%} was on the {%Himavat%} visited by the {%Lokapālas%}, viz.,
{%Varuṇa%} (blue as lapis lazuli), together with rivers, {%Nāgas%},
{%Daityas%}, and {%Sādhyas; Kubera%}, who dwells on {%Kailāsa%},
golden-coloured ({%jāmbūnadavapuḥ%}), accompanied by {%Yakṣas%};
{%Yama%}, with staff in hand ({%daṇḍapāṇiḥ%}), illuminating the
three worlds, and the {%Guhyakas, Gandharvas%}, and {%Nagās%},
accompanied by those lords of the creation ({%lokabhāvanaiḥ%})
the {%Pitṛs%}; further {%Śakra%}, with {%Māhendrāṇī%}, mounted on the
neck of {%Airāvata%}, and surrounded by the gods, and eulogized
by {%Gandharvas%} and {%ṛṣis%}. Each of them occupied a particular
summit of {%Himavat%} ({%Yama%} to the south, {%Varuṇa%} to the west).
[Page372-b+ 63]
They granted him ‘sight’ ({%dṛṣṭi%}), that he might see them.
{%Yama%} said that {%Arjuna%} would defeat the {%Nivātakavacas%}, etc.,
and gave him his irresistible staff ({%daṇḍa%}) as a weapon.
{%Varuṇa (b%}) gave him his irresistible nooses. {%Kubera%} said that
in bygone {%kalpas Arjuna%} had always gone through ascetic
austerities along with them, and gave him his favourite
weapon {%Antardhāna (c). Indra%} said he would descend to
earth in his chariot with {%Mātali%} as his charioteer, and taking
him to heaven grant him all his celestial weapons (III, {@41@}).
