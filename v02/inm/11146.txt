[{@Uñchavṛtty-upākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode relating
to the gleaner”). § 718{%b%} (Mokṣadh.): {%Bhīṣma%} said:
M-ṛ {%Nārada%} wanders through all the worlds like {%Vāyu%},
not obstructed by anything; once he repaired to the abode of
{%Indra%}, who asked him if he had perceived any wonderful
incident. {%Nārada%} recited the following story (XII, {@353@}):
In the town of {%Mahāpadma%}, on the southern bank of the
{%Gaṅgā%}, there lived a brahman of the {%Soma-%}lineage ({%Somānvaye%},
i.e. {%Atrigotre%}, Nīl.), endued with amiability, etc.; he was in
great trouble with regard to the value of following the
ordinances of the {%Vedas%}, or the {%[Dharma]śāstras%}, or the
duties that eminent men of former times have performed
({%śiṣṭācīrṇa%}). Then there came to him a wise brahman as a
guest (XII, {@354@}); him he asked what he, having entrusted
his duties as a householder to his son, should do in order to
perform the highest duty of men, as he had no respect for
the religion of the {%Yatis%}, who depend upon alms. The guest
said that he was himself perplexed, as heaven had many
doors (examples) (XII, {@355@}); he told him (according to
what he learnt from his preceptor) to repair to {%Padma%}, the
righteous {%Nāga%}, who lived in the city called after the {%Nāgas%}
in the {%Naimiṣa%} forest, on the banks of the {%Gomatī%}, whence,
in a former creation ({%pūrvābhisarge%}) the wheel of righteous-
ness was set in motion ({%dharmacakraṃ pravartitaṃ%}), and
where all the gods had, in days of old, performed a great
sacrifice, and where king {%Māndhātṛ%} neglected ({%atikramañ%}
{%cakre) Indra%} (XII, {@356@}). The host became delighted, and
passed the night happily conversing with his guest about the
fourth mode of life ({%caturthadharma%}) [i.e. {%sannyāsa%}, renuncia-
tion, PCR.; = {%mokṣadharma%}, Nīl.]; the next morning, having
dismissed his guest, he set out for the abode of the {%Nāga%}
(XII, {@357@}), was shown the way by an ascetic, and received
by the beautiful wife of the {%Nāga%}; as the {%Nāga%} had gone to
draw the chariot of {%Sūrya%} for a month, and would be back in
seven or eight days, he passed this time on the banks of the
{%Gomalī%} (XII, {@358@}). On the 6th day the {%Nāgas%} of the city,
seeing him abstaining from food and [only] reciting {%mantras%},
came and asked him to eat; but he wanted to keep his fast for
eight days; if then the {%Nāga%}-chief had not come back, he
would break his fast. Then the {%Nāgas%} returned (XII, {@359@}).
When the {%Nāga%}-chief came home, he was informed by his
wife about the brahman's arrival (XII, {@360@}). The {%Nāga%}
doubted whether that brahman was a human being, as the
{%Nāgas%}, even by D., As., and D-ṛ, are considered to be endued
with great energy; his wife told him to go and speak to the
guest without the wrath which is natural to {%Nāgas%}; the
{%Nāga%} himself also blamed wrath, citing {%Rāvaṇa%} (who became
the rival of {%Śakra%} and was slain by {%Rāma%}) and the sons
of {%Kārtavīrya%} (who were slain by {%Rāma Jāmadagnya%}) and
{%Kārtavīrya%} himself (XII, {@361@}). The {%Nāga%} met with the
[Page691-b+ 63]
brahman (who characterized himself as a righteous being
({%dharmāraṇya = muni%}, Nīl.)) on the banks of the {%Gomatī%},
engaged in Yoga and reciting the {%Vedas%} in order to dispel all
evil from the {%Nāga%} (XII, {@362@}); he asked the {%Nāga%} whether
he had seen anything wonderful in those regions where he had
drawn the one-wheeled chariot of {%Vivasvat%}. The {%Nāga%}
described the wonders of which the Sun is the source (α).
The most wonderful was that one day, in former times, at the
hour of noon, a being came through the sky like a second
sun and entered {%Sūrya%} (XII, {@363@}). {%Sūrya%} declared it to be
a brahman, who had attained to heaven on account of his
having been crowned with success ({%siddhaḥ%}) in the
gleaning-vow ({%uñchavṛttivrate%}) (description), and because
he had gratified {%Bhava%} (Śiva) by praising him with
{%saṃhitāḥ%}, and now he “goes round the earth staying in the
disc of {%Sūrya%}; neither D., nor G., As., nor Pn. are superior
to those creatures that attain to this excellent end” (XII,
{@364@}). The brahman then betook himself formally to the
practice of the {%uñcha%}-vow (XII, {@365@}), and having saluted
the {%Nāga%}, he went to {%Cyavana Bhārgava%}, who initiated him
and recited the story of the brahman in king {%Janaka's%} palace
to D-ṛ. {%Nārada > Indra >%} the foremost brahmans. “During
my (i.e. Bhīṣma's) battle with {%Rāma%}, the {%Vasus%} told it to
me.” The brahman proceeded to another forest (XII, {@366@}).
