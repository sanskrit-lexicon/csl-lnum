{@Aṇīmāṇḍavyopākhyāna(ṃ)@}.¦ § 172 (Sambhavap.):
The history of {%Māṇḍavya%} (§ 80) is more fully described.
Suspicion had fallen upon him, because thieves had hid
their plunder in his hermitage, while he was sitting for years
with his arms upraised observing the vow of silence. When
impaled, he by his ascetic power not only preserved his life,
but summoned other {%ṛṣis%} to the scene, who came in the
night in the shape of birds (I, {@107@}). Hearing that he was
alive, the king asked his pardon and endeavoured to extract
the stake from his body, but was obliged to cut it off outside
the body. {%Māṇḍavya%} henceforth walked about with the stake
in his life, and thereby conquered {%lokas%} unattainable by others
and was called {%Aṇīmāṇḍavya%} (v. 4329). He ruled that an
act should not be sinful when committed by one below the
age of 14 years (I, {@108@}).
