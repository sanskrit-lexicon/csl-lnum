[{@Baladevatīrthayātrā@}]¦ (“Baladeva's visit to the sacred
places on the Sarasvatī”; cf. {%Sārasvataṃ parva%}). § 615
(Gadā-y.-p.): {%Vaiśampāyana%} said: {%Baladeva%} first proceeded
to {%Prabhāsa%}, where {%Uḍurāj%} (i.e. Soma), who had been affected
with phthisis ({%yakṣman%}), became freed from his curse,
whence its name. Asked by {%Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana%}
related {%Prabhāsotpattikathana%} (q.v.). Thence {%Bala-Rāma%}
proceeded to {%Camasodbheda%}, where he passed one night and
gave away costly gifts. Thence he proceeded to {%Udapāna (b%})
(IX, {@35—36@}), and thence to {%Vinaśana%} (IX, {@36@}), called so
by the Ṛ. because the {%Sarasvatī%} has there become invisible
from contempt of {%Śūdras%} and {%Ābhīras%}. Thence to {%Subhū-%}
{%mika (c), Gandharvāṇāṃ tīrtha (d), Gargasrotas (e%}); thence
(“smeared in white sandal-paste and attired in blue robes”)
to {%Śaṅkhatīrtha (f%}); thence to the {%Dvaita%} lake; then, along
the southern bank of the {%Sarasvatī%}, to {%Nāgadhanvan (g%}).
{%Baladeva%} then set out with his face towards the East, and
one after another reached hundreds and thousands of {%tīrthas%}
that occurred at every step. Bathing in all those {%tīrthas%},
and observing fasts, etc., as directed by Ṛ., and giving away
wealth in profusion, etc., he (always smeared with white
sandal-paste) set out for that spot where the {%Sarasvatī%} turns
in an eastward direction in order to behold the Ṛ. in the forest
of {%Naimiṣa (h%}), and he became filled with wonder. “There,
at {%Kurukṣetra%}, O foremost one of {%Kuru's%} race, do thou
perform great sacrifices and rites.” Thence {%Bala-Rāma%} went
to the {%tīrtha Saptasārasvata%} (description), resorted to by
[Page106-b+ 63]
{%Vāneyas%} and other ascetics, where the great ascetic crowned
with success ({%siddhaḥ%}) performed his penances (IX, {@37@}).
Requested by {%Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana%} related the history
of {%Saptasārasvata (i%}) and {%Maṅkaṇaka (j%}) (IX, {@38@}). Having
passed one night there, {%Bala-Rāma%} went to {%Auśanasa tīrtha%}
(“the {%tīrtha%} of {%Uśanas%}”) {%Kapālamocana%}; the great {%muni%}
{%Mahodara%}, whose thigh had been seized by the head of a Rā.
slain by {%Rāma%} [Dāśarathi], was liberated. There {%Kāvya%}
(i.e. Śukra, Uśanas) had performed {%tapas%}, and the whole
science of politics and morals ({%nīti%}) was revealed to him,
while meditating on the war of Dai. and Dā. Requested by
{%Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana%} related the story of {%Mahodara (k%}).
Thence {%Bala-Rāma%} went to the abode of {%Ruṣaṅgu (l%}), where
{%Ārṣṭiṣeṇa%} had formerly undergone austere penances, and
where the great {%muni Viśvāmitra%} had become a {%brahman%}. Then
to that {%tīrtha%} where {%Brahmán (Lokapitāmahaḥ%}) had created the
worlds; where the great Ṛ. {%Ārṣṭiṣeṇa%} had acquired brahman—
hood; where the Ṛ.-ṛ. {%Sindhudvīpa%}, the great ascetic {%Devāpi%}
(both in the {%Kṛta%} age, IX, {@40@}, 2294), and the {%muni Viśvā-%}
{%mitra%} had obtained brahmanhood (IX, {@39@}). Requested by
{%Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana%} related the history of {%Ārṣṭiṣeṇa%}
({%m%}) and of {%Viśvāmitra (n%}). Thence to the abode of {%Baka%},
where {%Dālbhya Baka%} had practised austerities (IX, {@40@});
which resounded with the chanting of the {%Vedas (brahma-%}
{%ghoṣair avākīrṇaṃ%}; B. has {%Brahmayoner Avākīrṇaṃ%} “from
Br. to Av.,” Nīl.), where the Ṛ. {%Baka Dālbhya (o%}) poured
the kingdom of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra Vaicitravīryi%} (?{%Vaicitravīryiṇaḥ%},
genitive) as a libation into the sacrificial fire. In that {%tīrtha%}
{%Bṛhaspati%} also poured libations into the sacrificial fire, by
means of flesh, in order to destroy the {%Asuras%}, and the
As. began to waste away and were destroyed by the gods.
Thence to {%Yāyāta tīrtha%}, where, at a sacrifice of king {%Yayāti%}
{%Nāhuṣa%}, the {%Sarasvatī%} produced milk and clarified butter,
whereafter {%Yayāti%} went to heaven. Once again {%Yayāti%}
performed a sacrifice there, and {%Sarasvatī%} gave to each
of the brahmans everything for which he cherished a wish;
they regarded the gifts as made to them by the king,
and praised and blessed him; D. and G. were pleased.
Thence {%Baladeva%} proceeded to the {%tīrtha Vasiṣṭhāpavāha%}
(IX, {@41@}). Requested by {%Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana%} told
the history of {%Vasiṣṭhāpavāha (p%}), and why it is so rapid,
and the brahmanicide of {%Indra (s%}), who was purified by
bathing in that {%tīrtha%}. Thence {%Baladeva%} went to the {%tīrtha%}
of {%Soma%}; where in days of yore {%Soma%} had performed the
{%Rājasūyā%} sacrifice, with {%Atri%} for his {%hotṛ%}, after which the
great battle took place between D. and Dā., Dai., and a Rā.,
named {%Tāraka%}, in which {%Skanda (Mahāsena%}) slew {%Tāraka%} and
obtained the command of the celestial forces; in that {%tīrtha%}
is a gigantic {%Aśvattha%} tree, under whose shade {%Kārttikeya%}
({%Skanda%}) always resides in person (IX, {@43@}). Requested
by {%Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana%} related the investiture of
{%Skanda (u%}). The {%tīrtha%}, where in days of yore {%Varuṇa%}, the
lord of the waters, had been installed by the celestials, is
named {%Taijasa%}. Having bathed in that {%tīrtha%} and adored
{%Skanda, Bala-Rāma%} gave gold, etc., to the {%brahmans%};
passing one night there, he became cheerful and happy
(IX, {@44—46@}). Requested by {%Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana%}
related the installation of {%Varuṇa (v%}) in a former {%kalpa%}.
Thence {%Baladeva%} (“the slayer of {%Pralamba%}”) proceeded to
{%Agnitīrtha%}, where {%Agni%}, disappearing, became concealed in
the {%Śamī%} wood, wherefore the gods repaired to {%Brahmán%},
and asked him to create fire. Requested by {%Janamejaya%},
{%Vaiśampāyana%} related the story of {%Agnitīrtha (w%}). Thence
[Page107-a+ 63]
he went to {%Brahmayoni%}, where {%Brahmán%} had exercised his
functions of creation; in days of yore {%Brahmán%}, having bathed
in that {%tīrtha%} with all the gods, created all the {%tīrthas%}
for the gods, according to due rites. Thence to {%Kaubera%}
{%tīrtha%}, where {%Ailavila%}. (i.e. {%Kubera%}) ({%x%}), having practised
austerities, obtained the mastery of all treasures ({%Dhanādhi-%}
{%patyaṃ%}), and all kinds of wealth, etc., came to him of their
own accord. {%Rāma%} there beheld the excellent woods of
{%Kubera%}. Thence {%Bala-Rāma%} went to {%Badarapācana%}, where
the fruits of every season are always to be found (IX, {@47@}),
and where many ascetics and Si. are dwelling. (The story of
{%Badarapācana (y%}) and of {%Arundhatī (z%}).) Requested by
{%Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana%} related the birth of {%Śrutāvatī (aa%}).
Then {%Baladeva%} proceeded to {%Indratīrtha%} (IX, {@48@}). (The
history of {%Indratīrtha (bb%}).) Thence to {%Rāmatīrtha (cc%}), the
resort of D. and B.-ṛ. Thence to {%Yamunātīrtha (dd%}). Thence
{%Baladeva%}, adorned with garlands of wild flowers ({%vanamālī%}),
proceeded to {%Ādityatīrtha (ee%}), where also Ṛ. {%Asita Devala%}
obtained great {%yoga%} powers (IX, {@49@}). (The history of
{%Asita Devala (ff%}).) Thence {%Bala-Rāma%} went to the {%tīrtha%}
of {%Soma%} (IX, {@50@}), where {%Soma%} had in former days performed
the {%Rājasūya%} sacrifice, and where the great battle was fought
about {%Tārā (Tārakāmayaḥ%}). Thence {%Bala-Rāma%} proceeded
to the {%tīrtha%} of the {%muni Sārasvata%}, where, during a drought
of twelve years, {%Sārasvata%} in former days taught the {%Vedas%}
to many {%brahmans%}. Requested by {%Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana%}
related the history of {%Sārasvata (gg%}) and of {%Dadhīca (hh%}).
Thence {%Bala-Rāma%} proceeded to the {%tīrtha%} of the old maiden
({%vṛddhakanyā%}) (IX, {@51@}). Requested by {%Janamejaya, Vaiśam-%}
{%pāyana%} related the story of the {%vṛddhakanyā (ii%}). While there,
{%Baladeva%} heard of the slaughter of {%Śalya%}. Having come out
of the environs of {%Samantapancaka (Samantapañcakadvārāt%}),
he enquired of the Ṛ. what was the result of a visit to
{%Kurukṣetra%}, which they told him (IX, {@52@}). ({%Kurukṣetra-%}
{%kathana (kk%}) (IX, {@53@}).) Having visited {%Kurukṣetra, Bala—%}
{%Rāma%} proceeded to a large and exceedingly beautiful
hermitage, overgrown with {%madhūkas%}, etc., and was told by
Ṛ.: Here {%Viṣṇu%} in days of yore undertook austere penances
and performed duly all the eternal sacrifices. Here a {%brāhmaṇī%}
girl, having from youth observed the vow of {%brahmacarya%},
was crowned with success ({%siddhā%}), and, in possession of {%yoga%}
powers, she proceeded to heaven. The beautiful daughter of
{%Śāṇḍilya%}, a {%brahmacāriṇī%}, who had performed penances difficult
to women, went to heaven [here], and was worshipped by the
gods and {%brahmans. Baladeva%} then began his ascent of {%Himavat%},
and soon came to the {%tīrtha Plakṣaprasravaṇa%}, and thence
to the {%tīrtha Kārapavana%} (PCR. {%°vapa°%}), where he passed one
night. > the asylum of {%Mitra%} and {%Varuṇa%}. From {%Kāra-%}
{%pavana%} > that spot on the {%Yamunā%} where in days of yore {%Indra%},
{%Agni%}, and {%Aryaman%} had obtained great happiness. Then
he sat down with Ṛ. and Si. in order to listen to their talk.
There came Ṛ. {%Nārada (ll%}), and, asked by {%Bala-Rāma%}, he told
him all that had happened to the {%Kurus%}, including the names
of those chiefs that had fallen (ν), and of those that were
still alive (ζ), and asked him to go to the field to witness the
mace-encounter between {%Bhīma%} and {%Duryodhana%}, which was
to take place that very day. {%Bala-Rāma%} then bade farewell,
and dismissed all those that had accompanied him to {%Dvārakā%},
and descended from {%Himavat%} and {%Plakṣaprasravaṇa%}, and sang
a verse in praise of the {%Sarasvatī%}. Then he ascended a chariot
with goodly steeds, and arrived on the field (IX, {@54@}).
