{@Yudhiṣṭhirāśvāsa@}¦ (“the consoling of Yudhiṣṭhira”).
§ 544 (cf Rāmopākhyānap.): {%Mārkaṇḍeya%} consoled {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%}, reminding him of {%Rāma's%} victory over {%Rāvaṇa%} by means
of monkeys and bears: “thou acts as a {%kṣatriya%} and has no
sin, even the gods, with {%Indra%} and the {%Asuras%}, must endure
the same; it was after such affliction that {%Indra%}, with the
{%Maruts%}, slew {%Vṛtra, Namuci%}, and the {%Rākṣasī Dīrghajihvā%};
{%Arjuna, Bhīmasena, Nakula%}, and {%Sahadeva%} are capable of
vanquishing {%Indra%} with the {%Maruts; Jayadratha%}, who
abducted Kṛṣṇā, was vanquished” (III, {@292@}).
