{@Jambū@}.¦ § 574{%i%} (Jambūkh.): On the south of Nīla and the
north of Niṣadha there is a huge eternal {%jambū%} tree ({%Eugenia%}
{%jambolana%}, rose-apple), named {%Sudarśana%}, and adored by Si,
and Cā.; it grants every wish, and after it {%Jambūdvīpa%} has its
name; the tree is 1,100 {%yojanas%} high and touches the very
heavens. The circumference of a fruit of that tree measures
2,500 cubits; when ripe the fruit bursts, and pours out a
silvery juice which becomes a river, which passes round {%Meru%}
and comes to the northern {%Kurus%}; the drinking of that juice
conduces to peace of mind, no thirst is felt ever after, nor
decrepitude. On that spot there is found a species of gold,
called {%jāmbūnada%}, used for celestial ornaments and like the
complexion of {%indragopaka%} (cochineal) insects. The men
who live there are of the complexion of the morning sun:
