[{@Gṛdhra-gomāyu-saṃvāda(ḥ)@}]¦ (“the discourse
between a vulture and a jackal”). § 653{%b%} (Āpaddh.):
{%Bhīṣma%} related: The young child of a {%brahman%} died and was
taken to the burning-place; a vulture caused the lamenting
kinsmen to leave the child, as the sun was soon to set,
saying that the child could not be revived by their lingering.
A jackal, black as a raven, rebuked them for not waiting till
the sun had set, as the child might possibly revive. The
vulture and the jackal alternately endeavoured to persuade
them. The jackal mentioned that by {%Rāma's%} [i.e. {%Dāśarathi's%}]
slaying the {%Śūdra%} named {%Śambuka%}, a {%brahmaṇa%} child was
restored to life; similarly the son of R.-ṛ. {%Śveta%}. The vulture
said that if only {%Rudra%}, etc. (α), would grant him a boon,
the child might come back to life, and mentioned the
spirits and Y. and Rā., etc., who haunt the burning-place,
while the jackal reminded them that it was here on this
“quiet and peaceful” spot that the {%Pitṛs%} by thousands took
leave of the world. The jackal and the vulture continued to
dispute, exhausted with hunger and thirst, wishing to get
opportunity of devouring the child. Then {%Śaṅkara%} (i.e. {%Śiva%})
exhorted by his consort came, and, taking up a quantity of
water in his hands, restored the child to life for a hundred
years, and to the jackal and the vulture he granted a boon, in
consequence of which their hunger was appeased. Blessing
upon the reader (XII, {@153@}).
