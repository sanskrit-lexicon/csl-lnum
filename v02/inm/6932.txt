(on his digvijaya Sahadeva came to {%M.%}, the capital of king
{%Nīla%}, and fought with {%Nīla%}, who was assisted by {%Agni%}).—
§ 282{%b%} (do.): {%Agni%} had become enamoured of {%Nīla's%} daughter
and would not blaze up till agitated by the breath of her lips;
one day when he enjoyed her love, disguised as a brahman,
he was discovered by {%Nīla%}, who ordered the brahman to be
punished according to the law, but as {%Agni%} flamed up in
wrath, the king bestowed his daughter upon him and was
granted the boon that his army should have no fear from
enemies, and from that time those monarchs who attacked
{%Nīla%} were consumed by {%Agni%}. The wives of {%M%}. were granted
sexual liberty, and were not confined to a particular husband.
From that time the monarchs avoid {%M%}. from fear of {%Agni%}:
