{@[Nivātakavacayuddhaparvan(°va).]@}¦ (“Arjuna's
combat with the Nivātakavacas,” the 39th of the minor
parvans of Mhbhr.) § 441: One day, when the Pārthas
were thinking of {%Arjuna%}, they saw {%Indra's%} chariot (in which
{%Indra%} had slain seven phalanxes of {%Diti's%} sons), driven
by {%Mātali%}, illuminating the sky, and {%Arjuna%} descended
and saluted each of them; {%Mātali%} also greeted and instructed
them, and then returned in the chariot to {%Indra. Arjuna%}
then gave to {%Draupadī%} precious gems, etc., presented to him
by {%Indra%}. Then he related all as it had happened, and slept
that night with the two sons of {%Mādrī%} (III, {@165@}). The
next morning {%Indra%} visited them under the sound of musical
instruments, etc., and blessed {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, and advised
him to repair to {%Kāmyaka%}. Blessing upon the reader
(III, {@166@}).—§ 442: When {%Indra%} had gone, {%Arjuna%} related
his journey from {%Kāmyaka%} (see §§ 330—3), etc. (of mountains
he mentioned only {%Bhṛgutuṅga%}, where he spent one night
and subsequently saw the brahman; then {%Himavat%}, where the
meeting with the {%Kirāta%} took place on the first day of the
fifth month after the beginning of his penances; the {%Kirāta%}
multiplied a hundredfold and a thousandfold, and was
transformed in various manners; {%Arjuna%} in vain employed
the {%Vāyavya, Sthūṇākarṇa%} (see Nīl.), {%Jāla%} (i.e. {%Vāruṇa%}, Nīl.),
and the {%Śalabhāstra%}, and showers of shafts and stones, as the
{%Kirāta%} swallowed them up all; {%Arjuna%} in vain discharged
the {%Brahmāstra%}) (III, {@167@}).—§ 443: {%Arjuna%} continued his
narrative (see §§ 334—7): he passed the night after the
meeting with the {%Kirāta%} at that place, and in the morning
he saw again the same brahman (= {%Indra%}), and in the
evening he had the visit of the {%Lokapālas%}; the weapons
that {%Indra%} promised to teach him were: those of {%Vāyu, Agni%},
the {%Vasus, Varuṇa%}, the {%Maruts%}, the {%Sādhya%} and {%Paitāmaha%}
weapons, those of the {%Gandharvas, Uragas%} (i.e. Snakes), and
{%Rākṣasas%}, and all the {%Vaiṣṇava%} and {%Nairṛta%} weapons [v. 12020
foll.]; in the chariot of {%Indra, Mātali%} wondered that {%Arjuna%}
[Page521-a+ 63]
was not jerked, though {%Indra%} always himself gets jerked at
the first pull by the steeds [v. 12030]; when he had learnt
the weapons, {%Indra%} said that now even the gods could not
conquer him (v. 12054); he had received knowledge of
fifteen weapons with five modes of using them, viz. {%Prayoga%}
[discharge], {%upasaṃhāra%} [withdrawal], {%āvṛtti%} [redischarge],
{%prāyaścitta%} [revival of harmless beings slain by any weapon,
PCR., Nīl.], and {%pratighāta%} [revival of weapons baffled by
those of the enemies, PCR., Nīl.] (vv. 12058—9); {%Indra%} asked
him, as his fee, to slay the {%Nivātakavacas%}, who were
thirty millions ({%tisraḥ koṭyaḥ%}) in number and dwelt in the
ocean, and gave him the chariot (conducted by {%Mātali%}),
upon which he ({%Indra%}) had vanquished {%Bali%} ({%Baliṃ%}
{%Vairocaniṃ%}, v. 12068), {%Śambara, Bala, Vṛtra, Prahlāda%},
and {%Naraka%}, and millions of {%Daityas%}, and “this” diadem,
and ornaments like his own, and the impenetrable mail, and
fastened “this” durable ({%ajarāṃ%}) string to the {%Gāṇḍīva%},
and the gods gave him the shell {%Devadatta%}, through which
{%Indra%} had conquered the worlds (cf. § 446) (III, {@168@}).—§ 444:
{%Arjuna%} continued: When he came to the ocean, he saw at
a short distance the {%Daitya%} city filled with {%Dānavas. Mātali%}
drove the chariot with force, and the {%Dānavas%} shut the gates.
Then {%Arjuna%} blew the {%Devadatta%}, and the {%Nivātakavacas%}
appeared with iron javelins, maces, clubs, hatchets, sabres,
discs, {%śataghnīs, bhuśuṇḍīs%}, and swords, and sounded dissonant
musical instruments. The {%Devarṣis%}, the {%Dānavarṣis%}, the
{%Brahmarṣis%}, and the {%Siddhas%} came to the battle (III, {@169@}).
With arrows inspired with {%mantras%} relating to the {%Brahman-%}
weapon ({%Brahmāstraparimantritaiḥ%}), then with the {%Mādhava%}
(PCR. Māghava) weapon and the {%Gāṇḍīva Arjuna%} killed
innumerable {%Nivātakavacas%}, and the 10,000 horses yoked at
the chariot conducted by {%Mātali%} trampled upon them
(III, {@170@}). {%Arjuna%} reduced a shower of crags to powder
by the {%Mahendra%} weapon, then dried up showers of water by
the weapon {%Viśoṣana%}, that he had acquired from {%Indra%}; then
he annihilated fire by the water weapon ({%salilāstra%}), and
by the stone weapon ({%śailena mahāstreṇa%}) he repeatedly
resisted the wind. Then darkness enveloped the world; the
steeds turned away, {%Mātali%} fell off, and the golden lash
fell from his hand; as {%Mātali%} was stupefied, a terrible
fear seized {%Arjuna; Mātali%} said that he had conducted
{%Indra's%} chariot in the battle for the sake of nectar, and in
the battles with {%Śambara, Vṛtra, Vairocani%}, etc., but never
had he lost his senses before. {%Arjuna%} comforted {%Mātali%}
and repeatedly frustrated the magic of the enemy, and
{%Mātali%} again conducted the chariot. Then on a sudden
{%Arjuna%} did not see the {%Dānavas%}, who had become hidden
by illusion ({%māyā%}) (III, {@171@}). {%Arjuna%} then fought with
invisible weapons. Then they withdrew the illusion and
entered their city. The fallen and their weapons covered
the ground so that the horses had to proceed in the
sky. The {%Nivātakavacas%} remaining invisible, covered the
welkin with crags; others, entering into the earth, seized
the legs of the horses and the wheels of the chariot.
{%Arjuna%} became distressed, but being advised by {%Mātali%},
he applied the thunderbolt, inspiring the {%Gāṇḍīva%} with
{%mantras%}, so that the arrows sent by the thunderbolt,
becoming thunderbolts, penetrated the illusions and killed
the {%Nivātakavacas%}. While the wives of {%Dānavas%} were
bewailing and at last fled to their palaces, {%Arjuna%} and
{%Mātali%} entered the city, that was superior to that of the
gods (to that of {%Indra%}, v. 12188). {%Mātali%} told him that
this was originally the city of {%Indra%}, but the gods had
[Page521-b+ 63]
been driven away from it by the {%Nivātakavacas%}, who
had through austerities gratified {%Pitāmaha%} and obtained
from him the boons, that they might reside here and
be free from danger from the gods. When {%Indra%}
applied to {%Svayambhū%}, he was told that he himself
in another body should destroy them. As the gods
were unable to slay them, {%Indra%} had given those weapons
to {%Arjuna%}, so that he might destroy them, Then {%Arjuna%}
and {%Mātali%} again went to the abode of the gods (III, {@172@}).
—§ 445: While returning he beheld a celestial city,
moving at will, with trees of gems, etc., with four gates, etc.,
and {%Mātali%} told him it was {%Hiraṇyapura%}, made by {%Brahmán%}
himself for the great {%Asuras%}, the {%Paulomas%}, and {%Kālakañjas%},
as the {%Daiteyī Pulomā%} and the {%Mahāsurī Kālakā%} had by
practising austerities for 1,000 celestial years obtained from
{%Svayambhū%} that their offspring should suffer little misfortune,
be incapable of being killed by gods, and obtain an aërial,
etc., city, invincible even by the gods, {%Maharṣis, Yakṣas%},
{%Gandharvas, Pannagas, Asuras%}, and {%Rākṣasas. Brahmán%} had
destined that {%Arjuna%}, a mortal, should kill them. “Therefore
destroy them with the thunderbolt.” A battle ensued; the
{%Asuras%} resorted to illusion; the city now entered into the
earth, and now it rose upwards, etc. Shot with the iron
shafts of {%Arjuna%} the city fell down. Then they environed
him in 60,000 chariots, etc. {%Arjuna%} applied to {%Rudra%}, and
seeing a man with three heads, nine eyes, etc., he applied
the {%Raudra%} weapon to the {%Gāṇḍīva%}; when it had been
hurled, there appeared forms of deer, lions, tigers, {%Garuḍas%},
{%Gandharvas, Yakṣas, Asuras, Guhyakas, Nairṛtas, Yātudhānas%},
etc., by thousands. The {%Dānavas%}, some of whom had three
heads, some four tusks, etc., were destroyed. {%Arjuna%} again
worshipped {%Tripuraghna%} (i.e. Śiva). {%Mātali%} rejoiced and
praised {%Arjuna%}. The wives of the {%Dānavas%} came out of the
city bewailing the slain. {%Mātali%} took {%Arjuna%} to the abode
of {%Indra%}, and related in detail to {%Indra Arjuna's%} achievement,
and {%Indra%} with the {%Maruts%} (v. 12269: the gods) praised
him, and said that gods, {%Dānavas, Rākṣasas, Yakṣas, Asuras%},
{%Gandharvas%}, birds, and serpents should not be able to resist
him in fight, etc. (III, {@173@}).—§ 446: {%Indra%} said that on the
battlefield {%Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Kṛpa, Karṇa, Śakuni%}, etc., should
not amount to (1/16) part of {%Arjuna%}. Then {%Indra%} gave him
“this” golden garland, the shell {%Devadatta%}, etc. (see § 443).
Then {%Indra%} told him to depart, “and thus after five years
I come to you on the summit of this lower range of
{%Gandhamādana (Gandhamādanapādasya%}).” Having promised
that he should in the next morning show {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} all the
celestial weapons, {%Arjuna%} passed that night there with all his
brothers (III, {@174@}).—§ 447: The next morning, when {%Arjuna%}
was about to show the celestial weapons to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, the
earth trembled, etc. The {%Brahmarṣis, Siddhas, Maharṣis%},
{%Devarṣis%}, gods, {%Yakṣas, Rākṣasas, Gandharvas%}, etc.,
{%Pitāmaha%}, the {%Lokāpālas%}, and {%Mahādeva%} with his {%gaṇas%}
appeared; {%Vāyu%} threw celestial garlands, sent by the gods,
on {%Arjuna%}, the {%Gandharvas%} chanted ballads, and {%Apsarases%}
danced; and sent by the gods {%Nārada%} came and prevailed
upon {%Arjuna%} not to use the celestial weapons without
necessity, as they would destroy the three worlds. Then
the gods, etc., went whence they had come, and the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} pleasantly dwelt in that same forest with {%Kṛṣṇā%}
(III, {@175@}).
