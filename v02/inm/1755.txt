{@Brāhmaṇa-māhātmya-kathana@}.¦ § 454 (Mārk.):
Questioned by the {%Pāṇḍavas%} about the greatness of the
{%brahmans, Mārkaṇḍeya%} told: A prince of the {%Haihayas%} killed
a {%brahman%}, whom he took for a deer, as he was enveloped in
the skin of a black antelope. The {%Haihayas%}, very afflicted,
set out inquiring as to whose son the {%muni%} might be.
Arriving at the hermitage of {%Tārkṣya Ariṣṭanemi%}, they told
him the matter, and learnt that it was his son, and that he
had been revived, because these {%munis%} had no fear of death,
as they spoke well of {%brahmans%}, etc. (III, {@184@}).—§ 455:
{%Mārkaṇḍeya%} continued: When the {%rājarṣi Vainya%} was per-
forming the horse-sacrifice, {%Atri%} desired to go and ask him for
alms, but gave up his desire of wealth and proposed to his
wife and sons that they should all retire to the woods. His
wife prevailed upon him that (though he had heard from
{%Gautama%} that there were {%brahmans%} about {%Vainya%} who were
jealous of him) he should first acquire riches and distribute
them to his sons and servants, and so he went to {%Vainya%} and
praised him as the foremost of sovereigns and the ruler of
their destinies ({%vidhātṛ%}). The {%ṛṣi Gautama%} blamed him for
thus flattering the king, and said that it was {%Indra%} who was
the foremost of sovereigns and ruler of their destinies
({%vidhātṛ%}). The {%munis%} (having let the pious {%Kāśyapa%} inquire
about the matter) applied to {%Sanatkumāra%}, who said that the
{%brahmans%} and {%kṣattriyas%} ought to act together, and that the
king (enumeration of honourable appellations) might rightly
be styled as {%Atri%} had done. {%Vainya%} then gave to {%Atri%} 1000
maidservants and 100 millions of gold [coins] and ten {%bhāras%}
of gold. Having given this to his sons {%Atri%} retired to the
forest (III, {@185@}).
