{@Upamanyu<sup>2</sup>, Vaiyāghrapadya@}¦ ({%°pāda%} C.), a ṛṣi.
§ 730 (Ānuśāsanik.): XIII, {@14@}, 634 ({%Vaiyāghrapādasya%}
({%°padya°%}, B.)), 655 (Kṛṣṇa came to the hermitage of {%U.%},
who advised him to gratify Śiva, whose granting of boons he
described).—§ 730{%g%} (do.): {%Upamanyu%} said: In the {%Kṛtayuga%}
there was a ṛṣi named {%Vyāghrapāda%}. I was born as his son
and {%Dhaumya%} as my younger brother. Accompanied by
{%Dhaumya%}, I once came to the hermitage of certain ṛṣis.
There I saw milk, which appeared to me to be like to
{%amṛta%}. Coming home, I asked my mother to give me some
food prepared with milk. Having no milk my mother was
sorry. She then took a cake (of rice) and boiled it into
water and placed it before me, saying that it was milk.
Knowing the nature of milk, I understood that this was not
milk; this I said to my mother, who then answered me
that ascetics in the wood could not have milk. “Whence
shall we, who live at the river, the resort of the {%Vālakhilyas%},
obtain milk? In the wilderness are no offspring of {%Surabhī%}.”
Then she told me to devote myself to {%Śaṅkara%} (i.e. Śiva).
Questioned by me about Śiva my mother then, in accordance
with the discourses of the {%munis%}, described the diverse
forms of {%Mahādeva%} (i.e. Śiva) (η). I then applied myself to
the practice of penances in order to gratify {%Śiva%}. After
a thousand celestial years {%Mahādeva%} appeared to me in
the form of {%Śakra%} (i.e. Indra) riding on his elephant, but
I did not desire a boon from any other deity than {%Mahādeva%}.
Questioned by Indra about the reason, I stated {%Śiva%} to be
the existent and the non-existent, the manifest and the
unmanifest, the eternal and immutable, etc., and that there
was nothing superior to {%Śiva%} (θ). {%Mahādeva%} resides in the
worlds named {%Bhū%}, etc. (ι). In all the encounters of the
gods, etc. (κ), {%Bhava%} restores power to those who meet with
destruction. It is {%Maheśvara%} who made futile the boons
given to {%Andhaka%}, etc. (λ). He is adored by {%yogins%}, etc. (μ).
{%Brahmán%}, etc. (ν), always say that there is none higher than
{%Mahādeva%}. His sign ({%liṅga%}) is worshipped by {%Brahmán%}, etc.
The creatures bear only the signs of {%Mahādeva%} and his spouse,
and those of {%Brahmán%}, etc. (ο). “I shall never acknow-
ledge any other deity. Nor would I take the fulfilment of
all my wishes from any other deity.” When I had finished
this-speech, the celestial elephant became transformed into a
white bull (description), on the back of which {%Mahādeva%},
with {%Umā%}, was seated (description of Śiva and his weapons:
{%Pināka%} (π)). The {%Pāśupata%} weapon is superior to all other
weapons such as the {%Brāhma%}, etc. (ρ), but the {%śūla%} (σ) is even
superior. {%Śiva%} was also armed with the battle-axe, which he
had given to {%Rāma Jāmadagnya%} (τ). He was surrounded by
{%Brahmán%}, etc. (υ). The deities praised Śiva by uttering
diverse hymns (ϕ). “I then praised him with a hymn (χ)
[Page692-b+ 63]
and offered him {%arghya%} (water). {%Śiva%} became gratified and
granted me the fulfilment of all my wishes. I once more
praised him (ψ) and asked that I and my kinsmen and friends
might always eat food with milk. {%Śiva%} granted this, and
that after the expiration of a {%kalpa%} I should obtain the
companionship of {%Śiva%}. Then the god disappeared”: XIII,

succeeded in seeing {%Śiva, U%}. afterwards recited to {%Kṛṣṇa%} the
1000 names of {%Śiva%}, which had been communicated to him by
{%Taṇḍi%}).
