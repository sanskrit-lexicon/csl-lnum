[{@Skanda-Śakra-samāgama(ḥ)@}]¦ (“meeting of Skanda
with Indra”).—§ 499 (cf. Skandotp.). The planets ({%grahāḥ%})
and {%upagrahas%} (see BR.), {%Mātṛs%} and the {%gaṇas%} of the {%pariṣads%}
preceded by Fire and other terrible gods waited on {%Skanda%}.
{%Indra%}, with the hosts of the gods approached, mounted on
{%Airāvata%}, in order to kill him. But {%Skanda%} defeated them
by flames, and when {%Indra%} pierced his right side with his
thunderbolt, thence sprang forth an armed youth {%Viśākha%}
({%vajra-viśanād jāto%}, v. 14384), and {%Indra%} and the gods sought
and obtained the protection of {%Skanda%} (III, {@227@}).
