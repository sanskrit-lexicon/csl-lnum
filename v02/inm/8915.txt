{@[Rājyalābhaparvan(°va)]@}¦ (“on the Pāṇḍavas' getting
half of the kingdom,” the 15th of the minor parvans of
Mhbhr.). (Cf. Rājyalābha, Rājyalambha.) § 244: The
{%Pāṇḍavas%} with {%Kuntī%} and {%Kṛṣṇā%} journeyed towards {%Hāstina-%}
{%pura. Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} despatched {%Vikarṇa, Citrasena, Droṇa%},
and {%Kṛpa%} to receive them. The inhabitants were filled
with joy. In order to prevent any difference between them
and their cousins, {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} caused them, with {%Kṛṣṇa%}
in the van, to repair to {%Khāṇḍavaprastha%}, taking half the
kingdom. With {%Dvaipāyana's%} assistance they measured out
a piece of land for their city, which was very beautiful, and
came to be called {%Indraprastha%}. Having settled the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
there, {%Kṛṣṇa%} came back with {%Rāma%} to {%Dvāravatī%} (I, {@207@}).
—§ 245: When the {%Pāṇḍavas%} were dwelling in happiness
at {%Khāṇḍavaprastha%}, one day the {%Devarṣi Nārada%} came to
them, and recommended them to make an arrangement so
that disunion might not arise among them for the sake of their
common wife, mentioning how {%Sunda%} and {%Upasunda%} had killed
each other for the sake of {%Tilottamā. Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked
who those {%Asuras%} were, and who this {%Tilottamā%} was (I, {@208@}).
—§ 246: {%Sundopasundopākhyāna%} (q.v.). The arrangement
the {%Pāṇḍavas%} made was, that if one of them should be sitting
with {%Draupadī%}, and one of the other ones should happen to
see it, he would have to retire into the forest for twelve
years and live as a {%brahmacārin%}. Then {%Nārada%} went away
(I, {@212@}).
