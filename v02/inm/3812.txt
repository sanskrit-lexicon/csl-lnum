[{@Duryodhana-yajña(ḥ)@}]¦ (“the sacrifice of Duryo-
dhana”). § 516 (Ghoṣay., cf. Karṇadigv.): {%Karṇa%} proposed
to {%Duryodhana%} that he should celebrate a {%rājasūya%} sacrifice
like {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}. But as the {%purohita%} told him that so
long as {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} were living he could
not undertake the {%rājasūya%} sacrifice, and advised him to cause
the tributary kings to pay him tribute in gold, and with that
gold to make a plough, and to plough the sacrificial compound
with it, and then to perform a {%Vaiṣṇava%} sacrifice that nobody
had performed before save the ancient {%Viṣṇu%} (v. 15292,
cf. v. 15329 foll.) which was equal to the {%rājasūya%}, this plan
was agreed upon. {%Duryodhana%} appointed persons to their
respective tasks, and desired all the artisans to construct the
plough, etc. (III, {@255@}). When {%Vidura%} had announced to
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} that the preparations had been made, messengers
were dispatched to invite the princes and the {%brahmans%}.
{%Duḥśāsana%} ordered one messenger to invite the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, but
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} replied that they could not come before the com—
pletion of the thirteenth year. {%Bhīma%} threatened; the other
{%Pāṇḍavas%} said nothing unpleasant. {%Vidura%} was charged with
the distribution of food to the guests. After the completion of
the sacrifice, all the kings having been dismissed, {%Duryodhana%},
with his brothers and {%Karṇa%} and {%Śakuni%}, entered {%Hāstinapura%}
(III, {@256@}). {%Duryodhana%} was praised by most of the citizens,
and his friends compared him to {%Yayāti, Nahuṣa, Māndhātṛ%},
and {%Bharata%}, who had gone to heaven after celebrating this
sacrifice (v. 15329 foll., cf. v. 15292). {%Karṇa%} said that when
{%Duryodhana%} had slain the {%Pāṇḍavas%} in battle and completed
the {%rājasūya%} sacrifice he would once more honour him thus,
and promised that until he had slain {%Arjuna%} he would not
allow his feet to be washed, nor taste meat, and he would
observe the {%Asura%} vow (i.e. not to drink intoxicating liquors,
Nīl.), and never refuse to give to whoever might solicit him.
