[{@Gālavacarita(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the history of Gālava”; cf. Gālavasya
caritaṃ). § 565 (Bhagavady.): In ancient times, in order to
try {%Viśvāmitra%}, who was then engaged in ascetic austerities,
{%Dharma%} in the form of the {%Ṛṣi Vasiṣṭha%}, and feigning him-
self hungry, came to his hermitage. {%Viśvāmitra%} cooked {%caru%},
but could not approach {%Dharma%} before his guest had dined with
the other hermits. {%Dharma%} said, “I have already dined;
wait here,” and went away. {%Viśvāmitra%}, bearing that food
on his head and himself subsisting on air, waited a hundred
years, while the ascetic {%Gālava%} waited on him. Then {%Dharma%}
accepted that food, which was still warm and fresh, and
called {%Viśvāmitra%} a {%viprarṣi%}, whereby he became a {%brahman%}.
{%Gālava%} repeatedly asked {%Viśvāmitra%} to take a gift from him
as his preceptor, and at last {%Viśvāmitra%}, seeing his persistency,
requested him to give 800 white steeds each with one black ear
(V, {@106@}). {%Gālava%} got troubled and was gradually reduced
to a skeleton. He thought of repairing to {%Viṣṇu%} (or {%Kṛṣṇa%}),
when his friend {%Garuḍa%} came, and said he had spoken to
{%Viṣṇu%} in his behalf, and that he would bear him (V, {@107@}).
{%Garuḍa%} described the East: here {%Savitṛ%} first rises, and the
{%tapas%} of the {%Sādhyas%} is performed at eve;…the two eyes
of {%Dharma%};…here the daughters of {%Dakṣa%} in primeval
times gave birth to their children, and here the sons of
{%Kaśyapa%} first multiplied; here {%Śakra%} was first anointed as
king of the gods; here is the {%tapas%} of {%Indra%} and the gods,
all their religious ceremonies; here the Creator ({%bhagavān%}
{%Lokabhāvanaḥ%}) first sang the {%Vedas%}; here {%Sāvitrī%} was first
said by {%Savitṛ%} to the reciters of the {%Vedas (brahmavādiṣu%}),
and here the Yajurveda ({%yajūṃṣi%}) was given by {%Sūrya%}; here
the {%Soma%} juice was first drunk by the gods, etc.; it was here
that {%Varuṇa%}, repairing to {%Pātāla%}, obtained prosperity ({%śriyaṃ%});
here the birth, growth, and death of the ancient {%Vasiṣṭha%}
took place; here first grew the hundred branches ({%sṛtayaḥ%})
of {%oṃ%}; here the {%Munis%} called {%dhūmapāḥ%} first imbibed the smoke
of the {%havis%}; here the thousand-rayed Sun slays, rising, the
wicked and ungrateful men and {%Asuras%}; here is the gate of
the three worlds and the path to heaven and to felicity
(V, {@108@}). {%Garuḍa%} menṭioned the remarkable subjects in the
South ({%dakṣiṇā diś%}, so called because {%Vivasvat%} gave it away
as a {%dakṣiṇā%}): {%Pitṛpakṣas trailokasya; Ūṣmapāḥ devāḥ%};
the {%Viśvedevas%} with the {%Pitṛs%}, with whom they equally
share the sacrifices in all the worlds; the second door of
{%Dharma…%}; the {%Devarṣis, Pitṛlokarṣis%}, and {%Rājarṣis%}, who
dwell here in great happiness…; it is the region whither
all must repair;…there are {%Nairṛtāḥ%} to be seen by the sinful;
the {%Gandharvas%} chanting on {%Mandara%} and in the abodes of the
{%viprarṣis; Raivata%} who, hearing the {%Sāmans%}, retired to the
woods, leaving wife and friends and kingdom; {%Sāvarṇi%} and
{%Yāvakrīta%} setting a limit to {%Sūrya%} (the southern tropical
circle, PCR.); {%Rāvaṇa%} soliciting immortality from the gods;
{%Vṛtra%} incurring the enmity of {%Śakra; Vaitaraṇī%} filled with
the bodies of persons condemned to hell…; reaching this
[Page288-b+ 63]
region the sun drops sweet water (i.e. the beginning of the
rainy season, Nīl.), and thence, proceeding again to the
{%Vāsiṣtha%} direction ({%Vāsiṣṭhīṃ kāṣṭhāṃ%} = the quarter of
the seven Ṛṣis, i.e. the North, Nīl), once more drops
dew ({%himaṃ%}); there is {%Garuḍa%} obtaining for food an
enormous elephant and tortoise; the great {%Ṛṣi Cakradhanus%}
birth from {%Sūrya%} took place here (he was afterwards known
as {%Kapila%} who burned {%Sagara's%} sons); the perfect ({%siddhāḥ%})
brahmans, named {%Śivāḥ%}, who fully had mastered the {%Vedas%},
here obtained liberation ({%mokṣa%}); here is {%Bhogavatī%}, ruled
by {%Vāsuki, Takṣaka%}, and {%Airāvata%}. Those that have to
journey hither encounter here a thick gloom, so that it cannot
be penetrated by either the Sun or by {%Agni%}; “even thou
shalt have to pass this road” (V, {@109@}). {%Garuḍa%} mentioned
the remarkable subjects and occurrences of the West: {%Varuṇa's%}
origin; his instalment by {%Kaśyapa%}; the Moon, quaffing all
the six juices of {%Varuṇa%}, becomes young again in the beginning
of the bright fortnight; the {%Daityas%} being routed and bound
fast by {%Vāyu%}; the mountain {%Asta%}; Night and Sleep; {%Śakra%}
beholding the goddess ({%devīṃ) Diti%} asleep, and cutting off her
fœtus, whence sprang the {%Maruts%}; the roots of {%Himavat%}
stretching towards the eternal {%Mandara%} (sunk in the Ocean,
Nīl.), the end of which is not to be reached by journeying for
even 1,000 years; {%Surabhi%} milking on the shores of the lake
with golden lotuses; in the midst of the Ocean the headless
trunk of {%Svarbhānu%}; the chanting of the {%Vedas%} by {%Suvarṇa-%}
{%śiras%} (invisible, and whose hair is eternally yellow); {%Dhvajavatī%},
the daughter of the {%muni Harimedhas%}, remaining in the air in
consequence of {%Sūrya's%} injunction, ‘stay’;…the sources
of the rivers; here, in the abode of {%Varuṇa%}, are the waters of
the three worlds; the abode of {%Ananta%}, and of {%Viṣṇu%}, and
of {%Pavana%} (the friend of {%Agni%}), and of the {%Maharṣi Kaśyapa%}
{%Mārīca%} (V, {@110@}). The North ({%uttara%}) has its name from
saving ({%uttāraṇa%}) from sin; it is also called {%madhyama%}, i.e.
between the East and the West. None can live there that is
unamiable, etc. {%Garuḍa%} mentioned its remarkable subjects
and places: {%Badarī%}, the asylum of {%Nārāyaṇa, Kṛṣṇa%},
{%Jiṣṇu%}, and {%Brahmán; Maheśvara%} with the effulgence of
the {%yugānta%} fire; {%Puruṣa%} dwelling with {%Prakṛti%}, invisible
to {%munis%}, D. with I., G., Y., and Si., except {%Nara%} and
{%Nārāyaṇa%}; there {%Viṣṇu%} appears alone, having 1,000 heads
and 1,000 legs; there {%Candramas%} (the Moon) was installed
in the sovereignty over the {%brahmans; Mahādeva%} receiving
{%Gaṅgā%} on his head; {%Devī%} practising austerities for obtaining
{%Maheśvara; Kāma%}; the wrath (of {%Śiva%}, PCR.); here took
place {%Kubera's%} instalment, on the breast of {%Kailāsa%}, in
the sovereignty of Rā., Y., and G.; {%Caitraratha%}; here is
the asylum of the {%Vaikhānasas; Mandākinī; Mandara%};
{%Saugandhikavana%}, guarded by {%Nairṛtas%}; the plantain forest
({%kadalī-skandhaṃ%}), etc.; the {%Siddhas%}; the seven {%Ṛṣis%} with
{%Arundhatī; Svāti; Brahmán%} near {%Yajña…%} the {%munis%}
named {%Dhāmā%} (? so B.) (whose origin, etc., are not known)
guarding {%Gāyantikādvāra%} (B. {%Gaṅgāmahādvāraṃ%}); the man
who passes beyond them will certainly meet with destruction,
except {%Nārāyaṇa%} and {%Nara%} or {%Jiṣṇu%}; here is {%Kailāsa%}, the
abode of {%Ailavila%}; the origin of the ten {%Apsarases Vidyut-%}
{%prabhāḥ; Viṣṇupada%}, made by {%Viṣṇu%}, when he, in his covering
the worlds with three steps, stepped on the northern region;
here took place king {%Marutta's%} sacrifice at {%Uśīrabīja%}, by the
side of the golden lake; here was {%Himavat's%} gold-mine, that
exhibited itself to the {%viprarṣi Jīmūta%}, who gave away the
whole wealth to the brahmans, and had it called after his
name ({%Jaimūta%}); here morning and evening the {%Lokapālas%}
[Page289-a+ 63]
({%diśāṃ pālaṇ%} proclaim “what business of what person shall
we do?’ it is called {%uttara%} (North) because it is superior
({%uttara%}) to all (V. {@111@}). At the request of {%Gālava, Garuḍa%}
carried him (description) to the East, and laughed at his
foolish thoughts of casting away his life. At the mountain
{%Ṛṣabha%} they rested for some time (V, {@112@}). On the peak
of the {%Ṛṣabha%} they met with a brahman lady, {%Śāṇḍilī%},
engaged in penances; she gave them cooked food; they fell
asleep. As {%Garuḍa%} awoke, his wings had fallen off. It was
because he had, out of pity, thought of carrying the lady to
the place where {%Mahādeva, Viṣṇu%}, etc. (α), live together.
She gave him his wings back, having warned him not to
contemn women, and they set out, but failed to find the
steeds. {%Viśvāmitra%} met them, and said the time had already
passed, but promised to wait for some time more (V, {@113@}).
{%Garuḍa%} explained the etymology of {%hiraṇya%} (gold) and {%dhana%}
(wealth), and why gold is not easily obtainable (see the
note of PCR. from Nīl.); it is guarded by the {%Ajaikapād-%}
{%Ahirbradhnāḥ%} and by {%Dhanada%} (i.e. {%Kubera%}). They went to
{%Garuḍa's%} friend, the {%Rājarṣi Yayāti Nāhuṣa%} (of the Lunar
race), in {%Pratiṣṭhāna%}, and told him the matter, and that
{%Gālava%}, when he had paid off his debt, would devote
himself to severe ascetic penances and give {%Yayāti%} a portion
of his wealth of asceticism; “as many hairs as there are
in a horse's body, so many regions of bliss are attained
by him that gives away a horse” (V, {@114@}). {%Yayāti%}, the
performer of 1000 sacrifices, the liberal ruler of all the
{%Kāśis%}, in view of the fact that they had come to him,
passing over all the kings of the Solar race, not having the
steeds, gave to {%Gālava%} his daughter {%Mādhavī%}, always solicited
by gods, men, and {%Asuras. Garuḍa%} went away to his own
abode, and {%Gālava%} offered {%Mādhavī%} to king {%Haryaśva%} of
{%Ikṣvāku's%} race at {%Ayodhyā%}, who was desirous of offspring
(V, {@115@}), on the condition that he gave as her dower the
800 steeds of the kind wanted. {%Haryaśva%} had but 200 steeds
of this kind; he therefore got the maiden—who by a brahman
had been granted the boon that after each delivery she would
be a maiden again—in order to beget only one son upon her,
for his 200 steeds. This son was {%Vasumanas%}. Then {%Gālava%}
offered her to king {%Divodāsa%} (V, {@116@}), the {%Kāśi%} king, son
of {%Bhīmasena%}. The same arrangement was made as with
{%Haryaśva%}. She bore him {%Pratardana%} (V, {@117@}). Then {%Gālava%}
came to king {%Uśīnara%} in the city of the {%Bhojas%}, with whom
the same arrangement was made. To him she bore {%Śibi%}
Then {%Gālava%} took the maiden and went to see {%Garuḍa%}
(V, {@118@}). {%Garuḍa%} said that the remaining 200 steeds were
unobtainable. For in days of yore {%Ṛcīka%} sought at {%Kānya-%}
{%kubja Gādhi's%} daughter {%Satyavatī%} in marriage, and was
requested by {%Gādhi%} to give 1000 steeds of this kind.
{%Ṛcīka%} obtained them at {%Aśvatīrtha%}, and gave them to the
king. Performing the sacrifice {%Puṇḍarīka%}, the king gave
them away to the {%brahmans%}. The three kings had each
purchased 200 of them from the {%brahmans%}, but the remaining
400, while being transported over the {%Vitastā%}, were taken by
the river (so B.). {%Viśvāmitra%}, instead of obtaining the 200
steeds wanting, begot {%Aṣṭaka%} upon {%Mādhavī%}, and gave him the
steeds; {%Aṣṭaka%} then went to a certain city ({%puraṃ prāyāt%}
{%tadā Somapuraprabhaṃ%}) and {%Kauśika%} (i.e. {%Viśvāmitra%}) to the
woods. {%Gālava%} dismissed {%Garuḍa%}, and returning the maiden
to her father, he went into the woods (V, {@119@}). {%Yayāti%} went
to a hermitage on the confluence of the {%Gangā%} and {%Yamunā%},
taking {%Mādhavī, Pūru%}, and {%Yadu%} with him, desirous of again
disposing of his daughter in a {%svayaṃvara%}. There was
[Page289-b+ 63]
assembled a vast concourse of N., Y., G., men, etc., and
numerous {%Ṛṣis%} resembling {%Brahmán%} himself. {%Mādhavī%}
selected the forest as her lord, practised {%tapas%}, and adopted
a deer's mode of life ({%mṛgacāriṇī%}). King {%Yayāti%} died after
having lived for many thousands of years. The progeny
of {%Pūru%} and {%Yadu%} multiplied greatly. {%Yayāti%}, resembling
a {%maharṣi%}, enjoyed the highest bliss in heaven for many
thousands of years. On one occasion, while seated among
the {%Rājarṣis%} and {%Maharṣis%}, king {%Yayāti%} mentally disregarded
all the gods and {%Ṛṣis%} and men. {%Indra%} at once read his heart;
the dwellers of heaven did not longer know him, and he was
soon divested of his splendour (V. {@120@}). For continuation
v. Yayāti (§ 566).
