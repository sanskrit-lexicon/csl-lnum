{@Tārakavadhopākhyāna@}¦ (“the episode relating to the
destruction of Tāraka”; continuation of Suvarṇotpatti,
§ 747{%b%}). § 748{%b%} (Ānuśāsanik.): D. and Ṛ., reduced to great
distress [by Tāraka's prowess and the conduct of Gaṅgā by
throwing away Agni's seed], urged the six {%Kṛttikāḥ%} to rear that
child [i.e. Skanda]. Amongst the celestial ladies there were
none, save these, that could bear the seed of {%Agni%} in their
wombs. {%Agni%} became gratified. His energy was divided
into six portions, and a portion was placed in each of the
{%Kṛttikās%}. All of them were delivered at the same time, and
the six portions united into one. The Earth received the child
from a heap of gold. He grew up in a celestial forest of
reeds, reared by the {%Kṛttikās%} (whence he came to be called
{%Kārttikeya%}; etymology of {%Skanda%} and {%Guha%}). The thirty-
three gods, etc. (α) came to see him; Ṛ. praised him, G. sang
in honour of {%Kumāra%}, with six faces, etc. (description). The
gods gave him various kinds of toys, etc. (β). Rā. and As.
began to walk in the train of {%Skanda. Tāraka%} in vain sought,
by various means, to slay him. The gods made him the
commander of their forces, and when he had grown up he
slew {%Tāraka%} with his irresistible dart as in sport, and
re-established {%Indra%} in the sovereignty. {%Skanda%} became the
protector of the gods and [always] did what was agreeable to
{%Śaṅkara%} (i.e. Śiva). Gold is the powerful energy of {%Agni%} and
was born [from the same seed] with {%Kārttikeya%}; hence gold
is highly auspicious. Thus did {%Vasiṣṭha%} relate to {%Rāma%}
{%[Jāmadagnya]%} in days of old. By making gifts of gold {%Rāma%}
became purified of all his sins, and [finally] attained to a
high place in heaven that is not easily attainable by men
(XIII, {@86@}).
