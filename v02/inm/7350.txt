rule for attaining to emancipation from transmigration,”
the 90th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.; cf. Mokṣadharma).
§ 659: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired about the duties in the four
stages of life; {%Bhīṣma%} indicated the attainment of emanci-
pation as the highest of all duties. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked
{%Bhīṣma%} how grief might be overcome; {%Bhīṣma%} related
the old story of the conversation between a {%brahman%} and
king {%Senajit%}, burning with sorrow on account of the death
of his son; dissociation from the world is the grand method
of overcoming grief. The {%brahman%} cited the verses sung by
{%Piṅgalā%} (a fallen woman who was denied the company of
her lover through an accident) about the manner in which
she had acquired eternal merit; freedom from hope and
desire is felicity. King {%Senajit%} experienced delight and
became very happy (XII, {@174@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired of
{%Bhīṣma%} as to what constitutes the highest good that man
should seek in view of the transient character of time;
{%Bhīṣma%} related the old narrative of a discourse between
a {%brahman%}, who was devoted to the study of the {%Vedas%},
and his son {%Medhāvin%}, who was well conversant with the
religion of emancipation, and acquainted also with the affairs
of the world, on the uncertainty of life and the mutability
of all things save {%Bráhman%} (XII, {@175@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked
how happiness and misery come to the rich and the poor;
{%Bhīṣma%} related the old narrative of what was sung by
{%Śampāka%}; who had achieved emancipation, told in former
times by a poor {%brahman%} rendered miserable by a bad wife,
etc.; the faults of prosperity; in renunciation is the highest
good of men (XII, {@176@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked what a man
must do to find happiness if he be poor. {%Bhīṣma%} explained
who is a happy man, and related the old narrative of
what {%Maṅki%} had sung when freed from attachments; {%Maṅki%}
found that he was assiduously doomed to disappointments;
at last, with a remnant of his property, he purchased a couple
of young bulls with a yoke; a camel ran away with them
upon its neck; {%Maṅki's%} observations, quoting {%Śuka%}: desire
is fraught with sorrow (XII, {@177@}). In this connection
reference is made to the old verses sung by the {%Videha%} king
{%Janaka%}, who had attained to tranquillity of soul: “even if the
whole of {%Mithilā%} be consumed in a conflagration I shall incur
no loss.” Discourse between king {%Nāhuṣa%} (i.e. Yayāti) and
Ṛ. {%Bodhya%} about freedom from attachment; {%Bodhya's%} six
preceptors ({%Piṅgalā%}, etc.) (XII, {@178@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} wished
to know by what conduct a person may succeed in this
world and attain to an excellent end. {%Bhīṣma%} related
the old story of the discourse between king {%Prahlāda%} and
a sage who had adopted the {%Ājagara%} vow: the indifference
of the latter to all worldly objects in view of the inevitability
of death (XII, {@179@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked which of these,
viz. kinsmen, or acts, or wealth, or wisdom, should be the
refuge of man. {%Bhīṣma%} answered that wisdom should be
the refuge, instancing {%Bali%}, etc. (α), and related the old story
of the discourse between {%Indra%} and {%Kāśyapa%}, a Ṛ.'s son, who
was brought to the ground by a {%vaiśya%} negligently driving
his chariot, and who in despair resolved to end his life; {%Indra%}
appeared to him in the form of a jackal and proved to him
the superiority of his status as a human being and a brahman;
not to yield to the instigation of the senses constitutes happi-
ness; “thou dost not regret ({%smārasi%}) wine ({%Vāruṇī%}) nor the
[Page482-a+ 63]
{%latvāka%} fowls; there is no drink and no food more delicious
than these;…the vilest {%Pukkasa%} or {%Cāṇḍāla%} never wishes
to give up his life.” {%Kāśyapa%} gave up the desire of ending
his life; he knew the jackal to be {%Indra%}, worshipped
him, and returned home (XII, {@180@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked
whether gifts, sacrifices, penances, and dutiful services to
preceptors are productive of merit. {%Bhīṣma's%} discourse on
righteousness and sin and their respective consequences
on life (XII, {@181@}).—§ 660: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired about
him who has created the universe and to whom it returns
when dissolution comes. {%Bhīṣma%} related the old narrative
of the sacred words that M.-ṛ. {%Bhṛgu%} uttered in reply to the
questions of {%Bharadvāja%}, on the {%Kailāsa%} summit, explaining
to him the cosmogony, i.e. {%Bhṛgu-Bharadvāja-saṃvāda(b%})
(XII, {@182—192@}).—§ 661: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked {%Bhīṣma%} about
the ordinances about conduct. {%Bhīṣma's%} discourse on the
characteristics of the wicked and the good (“{%Sūrya%} should
always be worshipped,” etc.), and the duties that all men
should practise, quoting D.-ṛ. {%Nārada%}; “one who has
abstained from meat should not take meat even if it be
sanctified with {%mantras%} from the {%Yajurveda%}” (XII, {@193@}).
Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} discoursed on {%adhyātma%};
the nature of the three attributes of Goodness, Passion,
and Darkness; the distinction between matter ({%sattva%})
and soul ({%kṣetrajña%}); the highest end to be obtained
is emancipation (XII, {@194@}). {%Bhīṣma%} discoursed on the
four kinds of {%yoga%}; “M.-ṛ., obtaining a knowledge of
the same, attain to eternal success ({%siddhiṃ%}) even here”
(XII, {@195@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired after the fruits of the
silent recitation of sacred {%mantras; Bhīṣma%} wanted to recite
the old narrative of the discourse between {%Yama%}, a {%brahman%},
and Time (v. {%infra%}, ch. {@199@}); on {%Sāṅkhya%}, “otherwise called
the {%Vedānta%},” and {%Yoga, Bráhman%}, etc. (XII, {@196@}).
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired about the other aims of silent
reciters; {%Bhīṣma%} indicated the different aims realized by
different kinds of reciters (XII, {@197@}); the nature of the
hell into which reciters may sink; the regions of Lp., etc.
(α), are hells compared to the region of the Supreme Soul,
i.e. to emancipation (XII, {@198@}).—§ 662: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
wished to hear in full the dispute between Time, {%Mṛtyu%},
{%Yama, Sūrya's%} son {%Ikṣvāku%}, and a {%brahman%}, referred to
above (v. ch. {@196@}); {%Bhīṣma%} related this old story, i.e.
{%Jāpakopākhyāna(b%}) (XII, {@199—200@}).—§ 663: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
inquired about the results of the {%yoga%} of knowledge, of all
the {%Vedas%}, and of observances and vows; {%Bhīṣma%} related
the old discourse between {%Manu Prajāpati%} and his disciple
M.-ṛ. {%Bṛhaspati%} (the foremost of D.ṛ.), in days of old, who
had studied the {%Ṛcs%}, etc. (α); {%Bṛhaspati%} asked how an
embodied being departs from one body and attains to another;
acts result from the desire of obtaining happiness and avoiding
misery; the efforts for the acquisition of knowledge arise
from the desire of avoiding both happiness and misery; it is
by avoiding acts that one succeeds in entering into {%Bráhman%};
the nature of {%Bráhman%} (XII, {@201@}); continuation of {%Manu's%}
discourse on the nature of emancipation and the soul; the
soul takes its character from the body; how the soul leaving
one body enters into another (XII, {@202@}); though invisible,
the soul exists (XII, {@203@}); continuation of {%Manu's%} dis-
course, explaining how the soul may be seen (XII, {@204@});
continuation of {%Manu's%} discourse, explaining how grief may
be avoided; how {%Bráhman%} may be attained (XII, {@205@});
abstention from acts is the highest religion (XII, {@206@}).—
§ 664: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked {%Bhīṣma%} about the nature of
[Page482-b+ 63]
the Supreme Deity ({%Viṣṇu, Nārāyaṇa%}, etc. (α)). {%Bhīṣma's%}
discourse, which he had heard from {%Rāma Jāmadagnya%}, etc.
(β), on the nature of {%Nārāyaṇa%} or {%Govinda%}, etc. (γ); the
{%Asura Madhu (b); Brahmán's%} seven will-born sons (δ),
etc. (ε). {%Madhusūdana (Kṛṣṇa%}) created day and night,
etc. (ζ); then from his mouth he created 100 {%brahmans%},
from his arms 100 {%kṣatriyas%}, from his thighs 100 {%vaiśyas%},
and from his feet 100 {%śūdras%}, and then he made {%Dhātṛ%}
(i.e. {%Brahmán%}, PCR.) the lord and ruler of all created
beings; {%Brahmán%} also became the expositor of the knowledge
of the {%Vedas; Virūpākṣa%} he made the ruler of the spirits
and ghosts and {%Mātṛs; Yama%} the ruler of P. [and] all sinful
men; {%Kubera%} the lord of all treasures; {%Varuṇa%} the lord of
the waters and of all aquatic animals; {%Indra%} the lord of the
gods. In those times men lived as long as they chose,
without any fear of {%Yama%}; offspring was begotten by
a fiat of the will. In the {%Tretā%} age children were begotten
by touch alone. In the {%Dvāpara%} age sexual intercourse
originated. In the {%Kali%} age men have come to marry and
live in pairs. The sinful creatures of the earth, born in
the southern region and called {%Andhrakas%}, etc. (η); in the
northern region, the {%Yaunas%}, etc. (θ); their practices are
similar to those of {%Cāṇḍālas%} and ravens and vultures; in the
{%Kṛta%} age they were nowhere on earth; it is from the {%Tretā%}
that they have had their origin; when the terrible interval
[between the {%Tretā%} and the {%Dvāpara%}] came, the {%kṣatriyas%}
engaged in battle. D.-ṛ. {%Nārada%}, that observer of all
the worlds, has said that {%Kṛṣṇa%} is the supreme god
(XII, {@207@}).—§ 665: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked who are the first
{%Prajāpatis%}, and who the great {%Ṛṣis%}, and in which direction
they dwell. {%Bhīṣma%} enumerated {%Brahmán's%} seven sons
(α), mentioned in the {%Purāṇas%} as seven {%Brahmáns%}. The
{%Prajāpatis%} that came after these are: ({%a%}) in {%Atri's%} race:
{%Prācīnabarhis (Brahmayoniḥ sanātanaḥ%}) > the ten {%Prācetasaḥ >%}
{%Prajāpati Dakṣa%} or {%Ka; (b) Marīci%} had one son {%Kaśyapa%} or
{%Ariṣṭanemi. Atri%} had another son born of his loins, the
handsome and princely {%Soma%}; he performed penances for
1,000 celestial {%yugas. Aryaman%} and his sons were rulers
and creators of all creatures. {%Śaśabindu%} had 10,000 wives,
and begot upon each of them 1,000 sons, who would call
none {%Prajāpati%} save themselves; the ancient ({%purāṇāḥ%})
brahmans call creatures ({%prajāṃ) Śāśabindavī%}; this race
became the progenitor of the {%Vṛṣṇi%} race. “These that
I have named are the illustrious {%Prajāpatis%}.” The deities
are: the twelve {%Ādityas%} (all sprung from {%Kaśyapa%}) (β); the
{%Aśvins%} (γ) (the sons of {%Mārtaṇḍa—aṣṭamasya%}); these were
first called the gods and the two classes of Pitṛs ({%? te ca%}
{%pūrvaṃ surāś ceti dvividhāḥ pitaraḥ smṛtāḥ). Tvaṣṭṛ's%} son
was the handsome {%Viśvarūpa; Ajaikapād%}, etc. (δ) [are the
eleven {%Rudras%}]; these were reckoned as gods at the time
of the {%Prajāpati Manu%}; the {%Siddhas%} and {%Sādhyas%}, different
as to perfect conduct and youth; the {%Ṛbhus%} and the
{%Maruts%} were also classes of gods (C. {%devānāṃ cādito gaṇāḥ%};
B. {%codito gaṇaḥ%}); thus are enumerated the {%Viśvedevās%} and
the {%Aśvins%}. Amongst them the {%Ādityas%} are {%kṣatriyas%}, the
{%Maruts vaiśyas%}, the {%Aśvins%} (engaged in penances) {%śūdras%};
the gods [called] {%Aṅgirasaḥ%} are {%brahmans%}. The person who
at morn recites the names of these deities becomes cleansed
of all his sins. {%Yavakrīta%}, etc. (ε), and {%Kaṇva%}, etc. (ζ), all
reside in the east; {%Unmuca%}, etc. (η), in the south; {%Uṣaṅgu%},
etc. (θ), in the west; {%Ātreya%}, etc. (ι), in the north. These
are the witnesses [of the universe] and the creators of all
the worlds. By reciting these names one is cleansed of all
[Page483-a+ 63]
one's sins; by sojourning to these points a person becomes
cleansed of all his sins and succeeds in returning home in
safety (XII, {@208@}).—§ 666: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired about
the reason of {%Kṛṣṇa's%} assuming the form of an animal.
{%Bhīṣma%} said that formerly, while hunting, he arrived
at the hermitage of {%Mārkaṇḍeya%}, where he was honoured
by Ṛ., and M.-ṛ. {%Kaśyapa%} related: In former days Dā. and
As. {%Naraka%}, etc., oppressed D. and D.-ṛ.; the earth seemed
to be oppressed with a heavy weight. The {%Ādityas%} repaired
to {%Brahmán%}, who said that {%Viṣṇu%} in the form of a boar would
slay the As. Some time afterwards {%Viṣṇu%} (having {%yoga%} for
his soul, etc.) penetrated into the earth (into {%Rasātala%}) in the
form of a boar, and uttering tremendous roars ({%nādena%}),
at which even D. with {%Indra%} became terror-stricken, pierced
the As. with his hoofs, etc., whence he came to be called
{%Sanātana. Brahmán%} explained to the gods that he was
{%Kṛṣṇa%}, the Creator of all things, the foremost of {%yogins%}, etc.,
he from whose navel the primeval lotus had sprung, etc.
(XII, {@209@}).—§ 667: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired about the nature
of that high {%yoga%} by which emancipation may be attained.
{%Bhīṣma%} related the old narrative of a discourse between a
preceptor (the foremost of Ṛ.) and his disciple on emancipation;
on {%adhyātma%} (undisclosed in the very {%Vedas%}); {%Vāsudeva%} is the
supreme [cause] of the universe; he is the origin of the
{%Vedas (viśvasya brahmaṇo mukhaṃ%}), etc.; he created P., D.,
Ṛ., Y., Rā., N., As., and men, etc.; having reduced every-
thing into non-existence, he once more, in the beginning
of a {%yuga%}, creates {%Prakṛti%}; at the end of every {%yuga%} the
{%Vedas%} and all other scriptures disappear; in consequence
of the grace of {%Svayambhū%}, M.-ṛ., through their penances,
first re-acquire the {%Vedas%} and {%Itihāsas; Svayambhū%} knows
the {%Vedas, Bṛhaspati%} their {%Aṅgas, Bhārgava%} (i.e. Śukra) the
{%Nītiśāstra%} (science of morality, etc.), {%Nārada%} the {%Gāndharva%}
(the science of music), {%Bharadvāja%} the science of arms
({%Dhanurgrahaṃ), Gārgya%} the history of the celestial Ṛṣis
({%devarṣicaritaṃ), Kṛṣṇātreya%} medicine, diverse other teachers
the philosophical systems ({%Nyāyatantrāṇi%}, cf. Nīl.). Neither
D. nor Ṛ. were [originally] able to apprehend {%Bráhman%};
only {%Nārāyaṇa%} knew it; from him Ṛ., the foremost D., As.,
and R.-ṛ. of old learnt it. Etymology of {%Puruṣa (navadvāraṃ%}
{%puraṃ vyāpya śete%}, v. 7679) (XII, {@210@}). Continuation of
{%Bhīṣma's%} discourse explaining how the inclinations and
instincts of a past life run towards the soul in a new
life (XII, {@211@}). Continuation of {%Bhīṣma's%} discourse on
abstention from acts and the nature of knowledge. Asked
by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} discoursed on the faults that should
be got rid of in order to attain to emancipation (XII, {@212@}).
Continuation of {%Bhīṣma's%} discourse (XII, {@213@}). {%Bhīṣma's%}
discourse on the means of conquering the senses (XII, {@214@}).
{%Bhīṣma's%} discourse on the consequences of attachment to
the objects of the senses (XII, {@215@}). {%Bhīṣma's%} discourse
on the nature and causes of dreams. Darkness has been
adopted by the {%Asuras, Bráhman%} is difficult of attainment
by either the gods or the {%Asuras%}; goodness, passion, and
darkness belong to the deities and the {%Asuras%}; goodness is
the attribute of the deities, while the two others belong
to the {%Asuras; Bráhman%} transcends all those attributes;
it is pure knowledge, and is obtainable only by withdrawing
the mind and the senses from all external objects (XII, {@216@}).
Who may be said to know {%Bráhman%}; the distinction between
{%pravṛtti%} and {%nivṛtti%}; the respective nature of {%prakṛti%} and
{%puruṣa%}; the nature and consequences of {%yoga%} (XII, {@217@}).
—§ 668: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired about the conduct by which
[Page483-b+ 63]
{%Janaka%} the king of Mithilā attained to emancipation.
{%Bhīṣma%} recited the old narrative of the conversation
between {%Pañcaśikha%} and {%Janaka%} of Mithilā, i.e. {%<is>Pañcaśikha-</is>%}
{%<is>vākya</is>%} ({%b%}) (XII, {@218—219@}).—§ 669: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked
what leads to happiness and what to misery and what to
freedom from fear; {%Bhīṣma's%} discourse on self-restraint
(XII, {@220@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} question about the merits of
subsisting upon the remnants of sacrifices, and whether
fasting be really a penance ({%tapas); Bhīṣma%} explained that
though fasting is generally regarded as a penance, it is not so
in reality, being rather an impediment to the acquisition
of the knowledge of soul; living upon sacrificial remnants is
regarded as fasting of the highest merit (XII, {@221@}).—
§ 670: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked whether man should be regarded
as the real doer of acts. {%Bhīṣma%} related the old narrative
of a discourse between the {%Daitya%} king {%Prahlāda%}, who
was unattached to worldly objects, etc., and {%Indra%}, who
questioned {%Prahlāda%} about the best means by which
knowledge of the soul can be attained, etc., and was
instructed by him. {%Indra%} became filled with wonder, and,
having worshipped the {%Daitya%} king, proceeded to his own
abode (XII, {@222@}).—§ 671: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired about
the kind of intelligence by adopting which a king deprived
of kingdom and prosperity may still live on earth. {%Bhīṣma%}
related the old narrative of the discourse between {%Indra%}
and {%Virocana's%} son {%Bali%}, i.e. <is>Bali-Vāsava-saṃvāda</is> ({%b%})
(XII, {@223—225@}).—§ 672: {%Bhīṣma%} related the old narrative
of the discourse between {%Indra%} and the {%Asura Namuci%},
i.e. <is>Śakra-Namuci-saṃvāda</is> ({%b%}) (XII, {@226@}).—§ 673:
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked as to what is good for a man sunk
into dire distress. {%Bhīṣma%} discoursed on fortitude, quoting
the old narrative of the discourse between {%Bali%} and {%Vāsava%}
(Indra), i.e. <is>Bali-Vāsava-saṃvāda</is> ({%b%}) (XII, {@227@}).—
§ 674: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired about the indications of future
greatness and future fall. {%Bhīṣma%} related the old story of
the discourse between {%Śrī%} and {%Śakra%}, i.e. <is>Śrī-Vāsava-</is>
<is>saṃvāda</is> ({%b%}) (XII, {@229@}).—§ 675: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired
about the practices that lead to the attainment of {%Bráhman%}.
{%Bhīṣma%} said that one engaged in the religion of {%nivṛtti%}, etc.,
can attain to {%Bráhman%}, quoting the old narrative of the
discourse between the wise {%Jaigīṣavya%} and {%Asita Devala%},
who was instructed by {%Jaigīṣavya%} to behave indifferently
towards praise and blame, etc., “D., G., Pś., and Rā. cannot
reach the rank which is his who has attained to the highest
end” (XII, {@230@}).—§ 676: Requested by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
about the man that is dear to all, {%Bhīṣma%} quoted the words
that {%Kṛṣṇa%}, asked by {%Ugrasena%}, said to him on a former
occasion on the subject of D.-ṛ. {%Nārada's%} qualifications
(XII, {@231@}).—§ 677: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired about the origin
and the end of all creatures, the nature of their thoughts
and acts, of the divisions of time, and of the allotted periods
of life in the respective epochs or {%yugas%}; having heard the
discourse of {%Bhṛgu%} to B.-ṛ. {%Bharadvāja%}, he had become
attached to {%yoga. Bhīṣma%} recited the old narrative of what
the divine {%Vyāsa%} said to his son {%Śuka%} (who had studied
the {%Vedas%} with all their branches, and the {%Upaniṣads%}, and
was desirous of leading the life of {%brahmacarya%}) about these
very questions. {%Vyāsa%} said: Only {%Bráhman%} is without
beginning and without end. Ṛ. have measured time thus:
15 winks of the eye = 1 {%kāṣṭhā%}; 30 {%kāṣṭhās%} = 1 {%kalā%};
30(1/10) {%kalās%} = 1 {%muhūrta%}; 30 {%muhūrtas%} = 1 day and night;
30 days and nights = 1 month (= 1 day and night of the
{%Pitṛs%}, the lighted fortnight being their day and the dark
[Page484-a+ 63]
fortnight their night); 12 months = 2 {%ayanas%} = 1 year = 1 day
and night of the gods ({%udagayana%}, i.e. from winter solstice to
summer solstice = the day; {%dakṣiṇāyana%}, i.e. from the latter
to the former = the night). Moreover, there are the day
and night of {%Brahmán%} and his years also. Of the {%Kṛta-yuga%}
the duration is 4,000 [celestial] years, with a morning
({%sandhyā%}) of 400 years and an evening ({%sandhyāṃśa%}) of 400;
the other {%yugas%} gradually decrease by a quarter. In the
{%Kṛta%} age all duties exist in their entirety, and all live for
400 years (free from disease, etc.); in the other {%yugas%} duty,
etc., decrease by a quarter. The duties for the several
{%yugas%} are different. In {%Kṛta%} penance is foremost, in {%Tretā%}
knowledge, in {%Dvāpara%} sacrifice, in {%Kali%} gift. These 12,000
[celestial!] years constitute a {%yuga%}; 1,000 {%yugas%} = 1 day of
{%Brahmán%} (when the universe starts into life) = 1 night of
{%Brahmán%} (= universal dissolution, the Creator being asleep,
having taken recourse to {%yoga%}, meditation). {%Brahmán%},
waking up, modifies the indestructible {%Bráhman%}, etc. (XII,
{@232@}). {%Vyāsa%} explained the creation, etc. (XII, {@233@}).
{%Vyāsa%} told how the {%Supreme Lord%} merges everything into
his soul (XII, {@234@}). {%Vyāsa%} discoursed on the duties of
a brahman; “they that are good deserve to have even
{%Uccaiḥśravas”; Satyasandha%}, having offered his life to save
a brahman, ascended to heaven; likewise {%Saṅkṛti's%} son
{%Rantideva%}, having given tepid water to {%Vasiṣṭha; Ātreya%}
{%Indradamána%}, having given wealth to a deserving person;
{%Śibi Auśīnara%}, having given his limbs and son for the
sake of a brahman; the {%Kāśi%} king {%Pratardana%}, having
given his eyes to a brahman; king {%Devāvṛdha%}, having given
a costly umbrella (with all the people of his kingdom);
{%Sāṅkṛti Ātreya%}, having given instructions to his disciples
on {%Bráhman; Ambarīṣa%}, having given eleven {%arbudas%} of
kine to the brahmans (with all the people of his kingdom);
{%Sāvitrī%} [i.e. Sāvitra = Karṇa, cf. XIII, 6253], by giving
away the ear-rings; {%Janamejaya%}, by giving away his own
body; {%Yuvanāśva Vṛṣādarbhi%}, by giving gems, a mansion,
and beautiful women; the {%Videha%} king {%Nimi%} gave away
his kingdom, {%Jāmadagnya (Paraśu-Rāma%}) the whole earth,
{%Gaya%} the earth with her towns (to the brahmans); {%Vasiṣṭha%},
when the clouds ceased to pour rain, kept alive all creatures;
{%Karandhama's%} son {%Maruta%}, by giving away his daughter to
{%Aṅgiras%}, ascended to heaven; king {%Brahmadatta Pāñcālya%},
by giving the jewel {%Śaṅkha%} (to brahmans); king {%Mitrasaha%},
by giving his dear wife {%Madayantī%} to {%Vasiṣṭha%} (with that
wife of his); R.-r. {%Sahasrajit%}, having given his life for
the sake of a brahman; king {%Śatadyumna%}, having given to
{%Mudgala%} a house made of gold, etc.; the {%Śālva%} king
{%Dyutimat%}, having given unto {%Ṛcīka%} his kingdom; R.-ṛ.
{%Lomapāda%}, having given his daughter {%Śāntā%} to {%Ṛṣyaśṛṅga%}
(obtained all his wishes); R.-ṛ. {%Madirāśva%}, by giving his
daughter to {%Hiraṇyahasta%}; king {%Prasenajit%}, by giving
100,000 cows with calves; etc. (XII, {@235@}). Continuation
of {%Vyāsa's%} discourse on the duties of a brahman: the
knowledge that should be acquired (α); knowledge is
necessary for emancipation (XII, {@236@}). The different
stages of a {%yogin's%} progress (XII, {@237@}). Asked by {%Śuka%},
{%Vyāsa%} discoursed on the character of that knowledge which
leads to emancipation (XII, {@238@}). {%Vyāsa's%} discourse on
whether acts are obligatory or optional; “the men of the
{%Tretā, Dvāpara%}, and {%Kali yugas%} are inspired with doubts;
the men of the {%Kṛta yuga%} are devoted to penances, etc.
In the beginning of the {%Tretā%}, the {%Vedas%} and sacrifices and
the divisions of caste and the several modes of life exist
[Page484-b+ 63]
in their entirety; in consequence, however, of the duration
of life having decreased in {%Dvāpara%}, all these things likewise
decline; in the {%Dvāpara%} age, and even in the {%Kali%}, the
{%Vedas%} are overtaken with perplexity; towards the close
of the {%Kali%} again it is doubtful if they ever become even
visible to the eye” (XII, {@239@}). Asked by {%Śuka, Vyāsa%}
discoursed on the import of those duties that lead to
emancipation; “in the feet [of living creatures] is {%Viṣṇu%};
in their arms {%Indra%}; within the stomach {%Agni%}; in the
ears are the quarters; in the tongue is speech which is
{%Sarasvatī%}”; success cannot be attained to without knowledge,
penances, subjugation of the senses, and renunciation;
the doctrine of knowledge as expounded in the {%Sāṅkhya%}
system (XII, {@240@}). The doctrine of {%Yoga%} (XII, {@241@}).
Asked by {%Śuka, Vyāsa%} reconciled the declarations of the
{%Veda%} about acts and abstention from acts (XII, {@242@}).
{%Śuka%} inquired about how emancipation may be acquired
without violating the ordinance about the obligatory character
of acts; {%Vyāsa's%} discourse on the duties of {%brahmacārins%}
(XII, {@243@}). {%Vyāsa's%} discourse on the duties of the house-
holder (XII, {@244@}). The duties of the forest stage of life.
“The fourth stage [of life] is based upon the {%Upaniṣads%}; the
duties laid down for it [i.e. renunciation] may be observed
in all the stages of life equally; this stage differing from
the others comes after domestic and forest life; in this
very {%yuga%} many learned brahmans have been known to
observe this stage; {%Agastya%}, etc. (β), were the authors
of this course of duties, and themselves observing them
have all proceeded to heaven; and so also {%Sudivātaṇḍi%}
({%yathāvāso 'kṛtaśramaḥ%}, i.e. who had no fixed residence), and
the numerous {%Yāyāvaras%}, etc. (γ); freed from fear and not
being counted among the stars and planets ({%anakṣatrāḥ%}),
[these] are to be seen in the firmament [as] hosts of
luminous bodies ({%jyotiṣāṃ gaṇāḥ%})” (XII, {@245@}). {%Śuka%}
inquired how one leading the forest mode of life should act
wishing to achieve emancipation; {%Vyāsa's%} answer about
the necessity, after having passed through the first and the
second stages, of having recourse to {%yoga%} in order to attain
to emancipation; the duties to be observed by such a man
(XII, {@246@}). {%Vyāsa's%} observations on the soul ({%jīva%}) and
the Supreme Soul (XII, {@247@}). {%Śuka%} asked what is
{%adhyātma%} and whence it comes; {%Vyāsa's%} explanation of
{%adhyātma; Śuka%} asked how one may succeed in under-
standing the unequal distribution of the five elements in
different objects, and which among those elements represents
which sense, etc.; {%Vyāsa's%} observations on the nature of
mind, understanding, and the soul (XII, {@248@}). Continuation
(XII, {@249@}). Do. (XII, {@250@}). {%Śuka%} inquired about
what constitutes the highest duty; {%Vyāsa's%} discourse
on duties (XII, {@251@}). Continuation (XII, {@252@}). The
relation of the senses and their objects to the five
primal elements (XII, {@253@}). Persons conversant with
the scriptures succeed in beholding the soul, etc.;…
the practice of {%yoga%} has been recommended by {%Śāṇḍilya%}
(XII, {@254@}). The tree of desire, its seed and roots and
branches and leaves and fruit (XII, {@255@}). {%Bhīṣma%}
recapitulated the substance of {%Vyāsa's%} discourse on the
respective attributes of the elements (XII, {@256@}).—§ 678:
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} lamented the carnage caused on the field of
{%Kurukṣetra. Bhīṣma%} recited the story of {%Anukampaka%}
({%b%}) with <is>Mṛtyu-Prajāpati-saṃvāda</is> ({%c%}) (XII, {@257-@}
{@259@}).—§ 679: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked what is righteousness
and whether righteousness is for this world or for the next
[Page485-a+ 63]
or for both. {%Bhīṣma's%} answer: the practices of the good,
the {%Smṛtis%}, and the {%Vedas%}, etc., according to Ṛ. of old
(XII, {@260@}). Continuation (XII, {@261@}).—§ 680: Inquired
of by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} about righteousness (XII, {@262@}) {%Bhīṣma%}
related the old narrative of the conversation of {%Tulādhāra%}
with {%Jājali%} on the topic of righteousness, i.e. <is>Tulādhāra-</is>
<is>Jājali-saṃvāda</is> ({%b%}) (XII, {@263—265@}).—§ 681: {%Bhīṣma%}
related an old narrative of what was recited by king
{%Vicakhyu%} (B. {%°khn°%}) through compassion for all creatures,
in condemnation of animal slaughter when he saw the
mangled body of a bull and heard the painful groans
of the kine in a cow sacrifice, and observed the cruel
brahmans gathered there to assist at the ceremonies. “{%Manu%}
has applauded harmlessness in all acts…The true
brahmans realize the presence of {%Viṣṇu%} in every sacrifice.”
Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} said that one should
acquire merit and act in such a way that one's body may
not languish and suffer pain, and that death may not come
(XII, {@266@}).—§ 682: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked whether one
should act speedily or with delay. {%Bhīṣma%} told the old
story of what occurred with respect to the wise {%Cirakārin%},
the son of {%Medhātithi Gautama%} of the race of {%Aṅgiras%}
({%Āṅgirase kule%}), who came to be called thus because he
used to reflect long upon all matters, etc., and was regarded
as an idle and foolish person. Once M.-ṛ. {%Gautama%} (the
foremost of practisers of {%yoga%}), witnessing an act of grave
misconduct in his wife {%Ahalyā%}, in wrath commanded {%Cirakārin%}
to slay her, and then departed for the woods. {%Cirakārin%}
began to think for a long while (description), remembering
that the father is the performer of {%garbhādhāna%} and
{%sīmantonnayana%}, etc., and that the mother is the son's
{%dhātrī%}, etc. (etymology of several names of the mother
and of the father), etc.; he thought that his mother was
not to blame, as {%Indra%} had come to her in the form of her
husband, etc. When many days had expired {%Gautama%}
returned, shedding tears of repentance and thinking that
the fault committed was due to his own carelessness
(etymology of two names of the wife), and now became
filled with great joy, and from that time, dwelling in his
hermitage, did not live separately from his spouse or his
son. He said: “Blessed be thou, O {%Cirakārika!%} do thou
always reflect long before acting,” uttering some verses
upon the merits of reflecting long. {%Gautama%} at last ascended
to heaven with his son (XII, {@267@}).—§ 683: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
asked how a king should protect his subjects without
injuring anybody. {%Bhīṣma%} related the old narrative of the
conversation between {%Dyumatsena%} and his son king {%Satyavat%},
and the words spoken by the latter in behalf of some
individuals who had been brought out for execution at the
command of his father (“the killing of individuals can
never be a righteous act”), quoting the instructions he
had received from their grandsires of olden days, as to how
kings should rule their subjects in the different ages (α);
“when the {%Kali%} age sets in…fifteen parts of even that
one-fourth of righteousness disappear, one-sixteenth thereof
being all that then remains of it,” and quoting {%Manu%}
{%Svāyambhuva%} (XII, {@268@}).—§ 684: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired
about the relative superiority of domestic life and {%yoga%}.
{%Bhīṣma%} recited the old narrative of the discourse between
the {%Yati Kapila%} and {%Syūmaraśmi%} on animal sacrifices, the
obligatory character of acts, and the merits of {%yoga%} and
renunciation. In days of old when {%Tcaṣtṛ%} came to king
{%Nahuṣa%}, the latter was on the point of killing a cow in order
[Page485-b+ 63]
to show him hospitality; {%Kapila%} said, “Alas! ye {%Vedas%}”;
Ṛ. {%Syūmaraśmi%}, entering the cow, blamed this saying of
{%Kapila%}, etc. (XII, {@269@}); the three classes of {%Pitṛs%} (α),
etc. (XII, {@270@}). Continuation (XII, {@271@}).—§ 685:
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked which among the three, viz. religion,
profit, and pleasure, is superior. {%Bhīṣma%} recited the ancient
narrative of the benefit that the cloud {%Kuṇḍadhāra%} (not
yet adored by other men) in days of old had conferred
upon a poor brahman that was devoted to him, and who
had failed to obtain wealth by worshipping the gods.
The brahman worshipped the cloud with {%dhūpas%}, etc.; the
cloud became pleased and said to the brahman that the
wise have ordained expiation for brahmanicide, drinking
spirits, stealing, etc., but not for one that is ungrateful;
“Expectation has a child named Iniquity, Wrath is a child
of Envy, Cupidity of Deceit, Ingratitude is barren.” After
that the brahman, on a bed of {%kuśa%}-grass and penetrated
with the energy of {%Kuṇḍadhāra%}, beheld all living beings
in a dream, and {%Maṇibhadra%} in the midst of the gods
employed in giving his orders; the gods were engaged in
bestowing kingdoms, etc., upon men, etc.; {%Kuṇḍadhāra%}
prostrated himself before the gods in the presence of all
Y. and prayed for some favour in behalf of the brahman;
{%Maṇibhadra%} first offered to give him wealth, but was
prevailed upon by {%Kuṇḍadhāra%} to give virtue alone. The
brahman became disgusted with the world and entered the
woods and practised severe penances (description), and his
mind was firmly set upon virtue; his strength did not
diminish, and after a long time he acquired spiritual
vision, etc. {%Kuṇḍadhāra%} then paid him a visit and caused
him to see the end that is attained by kings; he beheld
thousands of kings sunk in hell, and many living in this
world embracing lust and wrath, etc. {%Kuṇḍadhāra%} said:
“With these [vices] all human beings are enchained; the
gods are afraid of men; these vices, at the command of
the gods, mar and disconcert on every side; no man can
become virtuous unless permitted by the gods…” The
brahman confessed that he had not appreciated {%Kuṇḍadhāra's%}
favour as he ought to do; {%Kuṇḍadhāra%} forgave him and
disappeared. The brahman roamed through all the worlds,
having attained to ascetic success ({%siddhiṃ%}) through the
grace of {%Kuṇḍadhāra%}. D., {%brahmans%}, Y., good men, and Cā.
always adore only the virtuous (XII, {@272@}).—§ 686:
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked what that sacrifice is which is ordained
for the sake of virtue alone and not for the acquisition of
heaven or wealth. {%Bhīṣma%} related the history, formerly
recited by {%Nārada%}, of a brahman named {%Satya%}, who in
order to perform sacrifices lived according to the {%uñcha%}
vow (description); his wife {%Puṣkaradhāriṇī%} did not approve
of his conduct (i.e. his cruel sacrifices), but at his com-
mand she (clad in plumes of peacocks) joined a sacrifice
where he was the {%hotṛ%}. His neighbour the virtuous
{%Parṇāda%} at the command of {%Śukra%} (or, according to a
various reading, of {%Śukra's%} race, so B., the text of C. is
in disorder) addressed him in the shape of a deer, telling
him to slay him and sacrifice with him, and {%Sāvitrī%} also
told him to do so, but in vain; {%Sāvitrī%} then entered the
sacrificial fire; but the deer (who was {%Dharma%}), causing
the brahman through spiritual vision to behold Aps. and G.,
at first made him desire to slay the deer (at which his
{%tapas%} diminished greatly), but then won him over to the
{%ahiṃsā%} religion, and himself assisted him in his sacrifice;
“the injury of living creatures forms no part of sacrifice
[Page486-a+ 63]
(leading only to heaven)” (XII, {@273@}).—§ 687: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
inquired about how one becomes sinful, or virtuous, by what
one attains to renunciation, and by what one wins emancipation,
whereafter he was instructed by {%Bhīṣma%} (XII, {@274@}).
Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} expounded the means for
attaining to emancipation (XII, {@275@}).—§ 688: Continuation
of {%Bhīṣma's%} discourse, quoting the old narrative of the
discourse between {%Nārada%} and {%Asita Devala%}, whom {%Nārada%}
questioned about the origin and destruction of all creatures
(XII, {@276@}).—§ 689: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired after the means
for removing desire. {%Bhīṣma%} related the old narrative of
what was said by the {%Videha%} king to the inquiring {%Māṇḍavya%}:
“Even if the whole of {%Mithilā%} burn in a conflagration,
nothing of mine will be burnt down.” The brahman {%Māṇḍavya%}
became filled with joy and betook himself to the path of
emancipation (XII, {@277@}).—§ 690: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired
about the good which one should pursue in view of
the transient character of time. {%Bhīṣma%} related the old
narrative of a discourse between a father, who was devoted
only to the study of the {%Vedas%}, and his son {%Medhāvin%},
who was conversant with the religion of emancipation.
The father acted in the way pointed out [by his son]
(XII, {@278@}).—§ 691: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%}
explained of what behaviour a man should be, of what
acts, of what kind of knowledge, etc., in order to be able
to attain to {%Bráhman%} (XII, {@279@}).—§ 692: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
asked when he should succeed in abandoning sovereignty
for adopting renunciation. {%Bhīṣma's%} answer stating the
certainty of {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} acquisition of emancipation, and
quoting that discourse which was sung in days of old, viz. the
conversation between Dai. (As.) {%Vṛtra%}, after he became
divested of all his prosperity, and [his preceptor] {%Uśanas%};
{%Vṛtra%} said: “Desirous of fighting {%Indra%}, I beheld in that
battle {%Hari = Nārāyaṇa%}, etc. (α)” (XII, {@280@}); while
{%Uśanas%} instructed him about {%Viṣṇu%} whose head is
the infinite place [i.e. emancipation], {%Sanatkumāra%} came
there and, asked by {%Uśanas%}, instructed {%Vṛtra; “Viṣṇu%} is
{%Brahmán%}, etc.” (β); the six colours; the four higher
regions (γ); the indestructible and infinite some say is the
region of {%Mahādeva%}, etc. (δ). {%Vṛtra%} became free from sorrow,
gave up his life-breaths, and attained to the highest station.
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked whether {%Kṛṣṇa%} is identical with the
Supreme Deity; {%Bhīṣma%} answered in the affirmative.
{%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} applause of {%Vṛtra. Bhīṣma%} said that the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} would in the end be numbered among the {%Siddhas%}
(XII, {@281@}).—§ 693: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked how {%Vṛtra%}, whose
virtue and devotion to {%Viṣṇu%} and comprehension of the
{%Upaniṣads%} and the {%Vedānta%} were so great, was vanquished
by {%Indra%}, and how the battle took place. {%Bhīṣma%} described
the battle, i.e. <is>Vṛtra-vadha</is> ({%b%}) (XII, {@282—283@}).—§ 694:
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired about the origin of fever. {%Bhīṣma%}
narrated the <is>Jvarotpatti</is> ({%b%}) (XII, {@284@}).—§ 695: {%Janame-%}
{%jaya(!%}) inquired how the horse-sacrifice of {%Prajāpati Dakṣa%}
{%Prācetasa%} was destroyed during the age of {%Manu Vaivasvata%} by
{%Śiva%} in consequence of {%Umā's%} rage and grief, and how {%Dakṣa%}
was enabled to reunite the divided limbs of that sacrifice.
{%Vaiśampāyana(!%}) narrated the <is>Dakṣayajña-vināśa</is> ({%b%}).—
§ 696: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} told the 1,008 names
by which {%Dakṣa%} adored {%Śiva%}, i.e. <is>Dakṣa-prokta-Śiva-</is>
<is>sahasra-nāma-stotra</is> ({%b%}) (XII, {@285@}).—§ 697: {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%} again inquired about {%adhyātma%}, and had it explained
by {%Bhīṣma%} (XII, {@286@}).—§ 698: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired
how sorrow and death may be avoided. {%Bhīṣma%} related
[Page486-b+ 63]
the old narrative of the discourse between {%Nārada%} and
{%Samaṅga%} (XII, {@287@}).—§ 699: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked what
is beneficial for one who is not conversant with the scriptures,
etc. {%Bhīṣma%} related the old narrative of the discourse between
{%Gālava%} and D.-ṛ. {%Nārada%} (devoted to {%yoga%}) about the
{%āśramas%}, etc. (XII, {@288@}).—§ 700: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired
how a king should behave in view of the great object of
acquisition, and what attributes he should have for freeing
himself from attachments. {%Bhīṣma%} recited the old narrative
that was uttered by {%Tārkṣya Ariṣṭanemi%} to {%Sagara%}, who
asked his counsel. {%Sagara%} acquired those virtues which
are productive of emancipation and continued, with their
aid, to rule his subjects (XII, {@289@}).—§ 701: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
asked why D.-ṛ. {%Uśanas Kāvya (Bhārgavadāyāda%}) sided with
the {%Asuras%} and not with the gods, and whence he came
to be called {%Śukra%}; whence he got such superior excellence,
and why he does not succeed in travelling to the centre
of the firmament. {%Bhīṣma%} related the <is>Bhava-Bhārgava-</is>
<is>samāgama</is> ({%b%}) (XII, {@290@}).—§ 702: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired
about the acts by performing which one wins the highest
good both here and hereafter. {%Bhīṣma%} narrated what
king {%Janaka%} in days of yore had inquired of {%Parāśara%}
about the duties of life. “The sceptic argues: the deities,
G., and Dā. have become what they are in consequence of
their own nature” (XII, {@291@}). Continuation (XII, {@292@}).
“{%Rantideva%} obtained success in all the worlds by worshipping
the ascetics with offerings of only roots and fruits and
leaves. The royal son of {%Śibi%} won the highest regions of
bliss by gratifying {%Sūrya%} along with his companion with
offerings of the same kind…{%Ṛcīka's%} son became the
son of {%Viśvāmitra%} by adoring the gods with {%Ṛcs. Uśanas%}
became {%Śukra%} by gratifying the god of gods, and by
hymning {%Devī%} he sports in the firmament. M.-ṛ. {%Asita%}, etc.
(α), by adoring {%Viṣṇu%} with {%Ṛcs%} and by penances attained
to success” (XII, {@293@}). Continuation. “{%Svayambhū%} first
created {%Dhātṛ; Dhātṛ%} created a son who was engaged
in upholding all the worlds” (v. the note of PCR., p. 539)
(XII, {@294@}). Continuation. “The {%Asuras%} could not bear
that righteousness that prevailed in the world; multiplying
they [in the form of Lust and Wrath, PCR.] entered the
bodies of men; then was pride generated in men…;
at that time the gods repaired to {%Śiva%} and imparted to
him their conjoined energy, and he felled to earth with
a single shaft those three {%Asuras%}, viz. {%Desire, Wrath%}, and
{%Cupidity%}, who were staying in the firmament, along with
their very habitations, and also the chief of those {%Asuras%}
(i.e. {%Mahāmoha%}, PCR.); the men again obtained their
proper natures and began once more to study the {%Vedas%}, etc.
Then the seven Ṛ. came forward and installed {%Indra%} as the
chief of the gods, and took upon themselves the task of
holding the rod of chastisement over mankind. After the
seven R. came king {%Vipṛthu%}, etc., of the {%kṣatriya%} order; but
there were certain elderly men from whose minds all wicked
feelings did not fly away” (XII, {@295@}). Continuation.
“{%Brahmán%} by penances created all existent objects;
Ā., V., etc. (β), have all been crowned with success through
their penances” (XII, {@296@}). Asked by {%Janaka, Parāśara%}
expounded the reason of the difference of colour in men;
“originally sprung from {%Brahmán%}, all the inhabitants of
the earth should have been {%brahmans%}.” Various kinds of
{%kṣatriyas%}, etc. (γ), have sprung from the four original
orders by intermixture. {%Janaka%} asked how those born in
pure wombs and those in impure ones all became {%brahmans%}.
[Page487-a+ 63]
{%Parāśara%} said that it was by cleansing their souls by penances,
instancing {%Vasiṣṭha%}, etc. (δ). “Originally only four {%gotras%}
arose: {%Aṅgiras, Kaśyapa, Vasiṣṭha%}, and {%Bhṛgu%}; the others
have been due to the penances of those that have founded
them” (XII, {@297@}). Continuation. “Repairing to the
{%Sarasvatī%}, etc. (ε) one should make gifts, etc.” (XII, {@298@}).
Continuation of {%Parāśara's%} discourse on duties. {%Janaka%}
heard everything the Ṛ. said and obtained great happiness
from it (XII, {@299@}).—§ 703: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked what
opinion should be entertained about the virtues of truth,
self-restraint, forgiveness, and wisdom. {%Bhīṣma%} recited the
old narrative of the discourse between the {%Sādhyas%} and
a Swan ({%haṃsa%}), who was {%Brahmán%} wandering through
the three worlds, and having come upon the {%Sādhyas%}
instructing them about the religion of emancipation;
at last the {%Sādhyas%} put a series of detached questions,
which were answered by the Swan (XII, {@300@}).—§ 704:
Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} discoursed on the difference
between the {%Sāṅkhya%} and the {%Yoga%} [systems of philosophy];
what the kinds of diet are by taking which and what
the things are by conquering which a {%yogin%} acquires {%yoga%}
power; “the {%yogin%} can at his will enter into and emerge
from {%Brahmán%}, etc. (α)…; the {%yogin%} has {%Nārāyaṇa%}
for his soul; prevailing over all things, he is capable of
creating all things” (XII, {@301@}). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%},
{%Bhīṣma%} discoursed on the principles of the {%Sāṅkhya%}
[philosophy]; these principles have been established by all
the puissant {%Yatis, Kapila%}, etc.; with the objects are engaged
men, Pś., etc. (β); “{%Viṣṇu%} is attached to [the organs of]
motion, {%Indra%} to [those of] strength, {%Agni%} to the stomach,
etc.;…{%Sattva%} is attached to the soul; the soul has
{%Nārāyaṇa%} for its refuge, and he has emancipation for his
refuge; emancipation is independent of all refuge;…the
{%Prajāpatis%}, etc. (γ), fall away from their puissance in course
of many long ages;…the miseries endured by those that
fall into the river {%Vaitaraṇī%} in the realms of {%Yama…%}
the swallowing up of the moon and the sun by {%Rāhu%},
the falling of stars from their fixed positions and the
diversions of constellations from their orbits…lead the
{%Sāṅkhyas%} to seek emancipation”; the faults attaching to
one's body; “the knowledge of {%Vedānta%} is the island of
the ocean of life;…{%Sattva%} carries the {%Yatis%} to {%Nārāyaṇa%};
{%Nārāyaṇa%} carries them to the Supreme Soul ({%paramātmānaṃ).”%}
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired whether there is any consciousness
in the emancipate state; {%Bhīṣma's%} answer. Praise of the
{%Sāṅkhya%} philosophy (XII, {@302@}).—§ 705: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
inquired about what does deteriorate and what does
not. {%Bhīṣma%} related the old narrative of the discourse
between Ṛ. {%Vasiṣṭha%} and king {%Karāla-Janaka%}, who
asked for his instruction. “At the end of {%Brahmán's%}
night (differently Nīl. and PCR., cf. note, p. 589), {%Śambhu%}
of formless soul, etc., awakes, and once more creates that
first or eldest of all creatures; the eldest-born being is called
{%Hiraṇyagarbha = Buddhi = Mahat (Yogeṣu) = Viriñci =%} the
unborn; in the {%Sāṅkhya%} scriptures ({%Sāṅkhye śāstre%}) he
has many names…”; the creations of knowledge and
of ignorance; “bodies are possessed by all bodiless
creatures, D., etc. (α);…transcending the twenty-four
topics already adverted to is the twenty-fifth called {%Viṣṇu%}.”
“There are three colours in all: white, red, and dark”
(XII, {@303@}). Continuation (XII, {@304@}). Do. (XII, {@305@}).
Do. “That which the {%Yogins%} behold is precisely that
to which the {%Sāṅkhyas%} strive to attain” (XII, {@306@}).
[Page487-b+ 63]
Continuation (XII, {@307@}). {%Vasiṣṭha's%} discourse on what
is {%Vidyā%} and what is {%Avidyā%}. “{%Yogins%} have great regard
for the {%Sāṅkhya%} system, as also for the {%Vedas%}; in the
{%Sāṅkhya%} system no principle transcending the twenty-fifth
is admitted; in the {%Yoga%} it is said that {%Bráhman…%}
becomes the personal soul ({%jīva%}) only when invested with
ignorance; in the {%Yoga%} scriptures, therefore, both {%Bráhman%} and
{%jīva%} are spoken of” (PCR.) (XII, {@308@}). {%Vasiṣṭha's%} discourse
on {%buddha%} and {%abuddha%}. “I had acquired this knowledge
from the eternal {%Hiraṇyagarbha%} himself, who communicated
it to me for my having carefully gratified that great Being
of very superior Soul…; it has been imparted to thee
exactly as I had it from {%Brahmán%} himself.” {%Bhīṣma%}
said, “This knowledge was obtained by {%Vasiṣṭha%} from
{%Hiraṇyagarbha%}, from {%Vasiṣṭha%} it was handed over to
{%Nārada%}, and from this to me” (XII, {@309@}).—§ 706:
{%Bhīṣma%} recited the conversation between king {%Vasumat%},
son of {%Janaka%}, and a brahman and Ṛ. of {%Bhṛgu's%} race,
whom {%Vasumat%} saw in the forests when in pursuit of deer,
and by whom he was instructed. “R.-ṛ. {%Mahābhiṣa%},
through want of firmness, fell from heaven; {%Yayāti%}, though
his merits had become exhausted, succeeded in regaining
regions of bliss through his firmness.” King {%Vasumat%},
withdrawing his mind from the pursuit of desire, set it
upon the acquisition of righteousness (XII, {@310@}).—§ 707:
Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma%} discoursed on that which
is freed from duty and its reverse by reciting the old
narrative of the discourse between Ṛ. {%Yājñavalkya%} and
king {%Daivarāti Janaka%}, who got instruction from {%Yājñavalkya%}.
The nine kinds of creation (XII, {@311@}). {%Yājñavalkya's%}
discourse on the creation of the universe; “10,000 {%kalpas%}
are said to constitute a single day of the unmanifest one; the
duration of his night is equal; when his night expires
he awakes, and first creates herbs and plants; he then
creates {%Brahmán%} or {%Prajāpati%}, who springs from a golden
egg…; 7,500 {%kalpas%} measure the day of {%Brahmán%},
and his night is of equal duration; {%Brahmán (mahān%}
{%ṛṣiḥ%}) then creates {%Ahaṅkāra%} (i.e. consciousness; {%bhūtaṃ%}
{%divyātmakaṃ%}), etc.” (XII, {@312@}). {%Yājñavalkya's%} discourse
on the destruction of the universe: “{%Brahmán%}, who is
eternal and undecaying, and who is without beginning and
without end, repeatedly creates and destroys all created
objects; when his day expires and night comes he becomes
desirous of sleep; at such a time the unmanifest and holy
one urges the Being called {%Mahā-Rudra%} ({%ahaṃkṛtaṃ naraṃ%},
i.e. {%Ahaṅkārābhimāninaṃ%}, Nil.), who assumes the form of
{%Sūrya%} and divides himself into twelve portions, etc.;
…Consciousness ({%Ahaṅkāraḥ Prajāpatiḥ%}) in his turn is
swallowed up by the Great Soul ({%mahān ātmā%}; v. 11601:
the reading of B. is different), who ({%viśvaṃ%}) is again
swallowed up by {%Śambhu Prajāpati%}, [who is] {%Aṇiman%}, etc.
(α)…” (XII, {@313@}). {%Yājñavalkya's%} discourse on {%adhyātma%}
(“the two feet,” etc.), {%adhibhūta%} (“the act of walking,”
etc.), and {%adhidaivata%} ({%“Viṣṇu,”%} etc.) (XII, {@314@}).
{%Yājñavalkya's%} discourse on {%sattva, rajas%}, and {%tamas%} (XII,
{@315@}). {%Yajñavalkya's%} discourse of what is possessed of
attributes and what is not possessed of them (XII, {@316@}).
{%Yājñavalkya's%} discourse on the {%Yoga%} philosophy, “conferring
eight kinds of puissance and possessed of eight limbs”
(XII, {@317@}). {%Yājñavalkya's%} discourse on the diverse ends
that people attain to as depending on the manner in which
the soul ({%jīva%}) escapes from its mortal frame (XII, {@318@}).
The story of {%Yājñavalkya's%} acquisition of the {%Yajurveda%},
[Page488-a+ 63]
as a boon from {%Sūrya%}, who had been gratified with his
penances; {%Sūrya%} had said: “Made up of the essence of
speech, the goddess {%Sarasvatī%} will enter into thy body”;
“he then commanded me to open my mouth; {%Sarasvatī%}
then entered into my body and I began to burn, and
plunged into a stream, angry with {%Sūrya%}, who told me
that the burning would soon cease, and then the whole
{%Veda%} with its appendix and the {%Upaniṣads%} would appear
in me by inward light, and I should edit the entire
{%Śatapatha%}, and then turn to the path of emancipation,
coveted both by {%Sāṅkhyas%} and by {%Yogins. Sūrya%} then went
to the {%Asta%} hills. {%Sarasvatī%} appeared before me (description).
I taught the {%Śatapathabrāhmaṇa%}, etc., to 100 good disciples
and thereby did what was disagreeable to my maternal uncle
[{%Vaiśampāyana%}]. I undertook the management of the sacrifice
of thy father; there a dispute arose between me and my
maternal uncle as to who should be permitted to appropriate
the {%dakṣiṇā%} for the recitation of the {%Vedas%}; in the very presence
of {%Devala%} I took half of that {%dakṣiṇā%}; thy father and
{%Sumantu%} and {%Paila%} and {%Jaimini%}, etc., all acquiesced in that
arrangement. I had thus got from {%Sūrya%} the fifteen {%Yajuṣes%},
and likewise {%Romaharṣa%} learned the {%Purāṇas%} (differently
PCR.). Aided by {%Sarasvatī%} and {%Sūrya%} I then set myself
to compile the {%Śatapathabrāhmaṇa…%} G. {%Viśvāvasu%}
({%Kāśyapa%}, v. 11777), conversant with the {%Vedānta%}, once
put me twenty-four questions relating to the {%Vedas%}, and
then a twenty-fifth ({%ānvīkṣikīṃ%}) (α); having thought of
{%Sarasvatī%} I answered them properly, having expounded to
him the fourth science that treats of emancipation, and
which is based upon the twenty-fifth principle, i.e. {%jīva%}.”
(The answers to the questions.) The personal soul ({%jīva%})
and the Supreme Soul should be regarded as one and the
same. This {%Viśvāvasu%} thought difficult to understand, quoting
{%Jaigīṣavya%}, etc. (β); “M.-ṛ. in {%Brahmaloka%} say that {%Āditya%}
(the sun) himself is thy preceptor.” {%Yājñavalkya%} instructed
him of the relation of the twenty-fifth ({%jīva%}) to the
twenty-sixth (the Supreme Soul). “{%Viśvāvasu%} proceeded
towards heaven, and inculcated the science he had obtained
from me to the gods in {%Brahmaloka%}, etc.” Honoured by
{%Daivarāti, Yājñavalkya%} left his court; the king gave a million
of kine, etc., to a number of brahmans; installing his son in
the sovereignty of the {%Videhas%}, he adopted the practices of
the {%Yatis%}, and began to study the science of the {%Sāṅkhyas%}
and {%Yogins%}. “They who wait upon {%Mahat%} attain to the
regions of {%Mahat%}; they who wait upon Consciousness attain
to the spot that belongs to Consciousness, etc.” “I ({%Bhīṣma%})
got all this knowledge from {%Janaka%}, who had obtained
it from {%Yājñavalkya%}” (XII, {@319@}).—§ 708: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
asked how one may avoid decrepitude and death. {%Bhīṣma%}
related the old narrative of the {%Bhikṣu%} M.-ṛ. {%Pañcaśikha%}
and king {%Janaka Vaideha%}, who put him that same question
and was instructed by him (XII, {@320@}).—§ 709: Asked
by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} as to how it is possible for a householder
to attain to emancipation, {%Bhīṣma%} recited the <is>Sulabhā-</is>
<is>Janakasaṃvāda</is> ({%b%}) (XII, {@321@}).—§ 710: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
inquired how in days of old {%Śuka Vaiyāsaki%} was won
over to renunciation ({%nirvedam āpannaḥ). Bhīṣma%} recited
the discourse of {%Vyāsa%} to {%Śuka%} expounding the vanity
of worldly attachments. “That sinful wretch who
transgresses the ten boundaries that have been fixed by
{%Svayambhū%} himself is obliged to pass his time in great
affliction in the wild wastes in the dominions of the king
of the {%Pitṛs%}; that man who is tainted with cupidity…
[Page488-b+ 63]
has to go to deep hells…and is forced to bathe in the
broad river {%Vaitaraṇī%}, whose waters are scalding, etc.
(description of hell)…Very soon the wind of {%Yama%}
will blow before thee…By performing the duties of
the domestic life men attain to the region of {%Prajāpati%} or
{%Bṛhaspati%} or {%Indra%}.” {%Śuka%}, leaving his father, proceeded
to seek a preceptor that could teach him the religion of
emancipation (XII, {@322@}).—§ 711: Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%},
{%Bhīṣma%} discoursed on the efficacy of gifts, sacrifices,
penances, services to preceptors, etc. (XII, {@323@}).—
§ 712: Śukotpatti (q.v.).—§ 713: Śukakṛti (q.v.).—§ 714:
Śukakṛtya (q.v.).—§ 715: Śuka-Nārada-saṃvāda (q.v.).—
§ 716: Śukābhipatana (q.v.) (XII, {@324—334@}).—§ 717:
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} asked who the Supreme Deity is, etc. {%Bhīṣma%}
recited the old story of the discourse between {%Nārada%} and
Ṛ. {%Nārāyaṇa%} in the hermitage of {%Badarī%}, i.e. <is>Nārāyaṇīya</is>
({%b%}), including the story of {%Uparicara (c%}) and <is>Brahma-</is>
<is>Rudra-saṃvāda</is> ({%d%}) (XII, {@335—352@}).—§ 718: Asked by
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} about the foremost duties of men belonging
to the different modes of life, {%Bhīṣma%} related the discourse
on this topic in days of yore between D.-ṛ. {%Nārada%} and {%Indra%},
i.e. <is>Uñchavṛtty-upākhyāna</is> ({%b%}) (XII, {@353—356@}).
