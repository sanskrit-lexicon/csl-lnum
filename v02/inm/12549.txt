[{@Yakṣayuddhaparvan(°va)@}]¦ (“the combat with the
Yakṣas”, the 38th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.;
cf. Yakṣayuddha). § 436. The Pāṇḍavas, etc., returned
to the hermitage of {%Nārāyaṇa%}. Once {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} said to
them: “We have passed these four years in the woods; it
has been appointed by {%Arjuna%}, that after the fifth year he
will come to the mountain {%Śveta%}.” They then set out with
the brahmans and the {%Rākṣasas%}, and protected by {%Lomaśa%},
sometimes going on foot, sometimes carried by the {%Rākṣasas%},
towards the north, beholding on the way the mountains
{%Maināka, Gandhamādana%}, and {%Śveta%}, and on the seventeenth
day they reached the slopes of {%Himavat%}, not far from
{%Gandhamādana%}, and were received by R.-ṛ. {%Vṛṣaparvan%} in
his hermitage, where they passed seven nights. On the
eighth day they entrusted their remaining robes, their
sacrificial vessels, ornaments, and jewels to {%Vṛṣaparvan%},
and, following his instructions, set out for the north, on foot,
with {%Dhaumya, Kṛṣṇā%}, and {%Lomaśa%}. On the fourth day
they reached {%Śveta%}, and entered {%Gandhamādana (b%}) with
{%Draupadī%} and the brahmans, and saw the great {%Gaṅgā (c%}).
Thereafter, they went to the hermitage of {%Ārṣṭiṣeṇa%} (III,
{@158@}). {%Ārṣṭiṣeṇa%} received the four {%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%}
and {%Dhaumya%}, and said that during the {%parvan%} days {%ṛṣis%}
living upon water and air and moving through the sky come
to this mountain, sounds of kettledrums, etc., being heard
on the summits, and that they should not attempt to
proceed further, but wait for {%Arjuna%} there, as they could not
go beyond {%Kailāsa(d%}) (III, {@159@}).—§ 437. They passed the
fifth year in the hermitage of {%Ārṣṭiṣeṇa%}, eating flesh of
deer killed with unpoisoned shafts, listening to the stories
told by {%Lomaśa. Ghaṭotkaca%} had departed, promising to be
present when occasion arose. {%Munis%} and {%Cāraṇas%} visited
them. One day {%Suparṇa%} carried off a mighty {%Nāga%} from the
lake, while the mountain trembled, etc., and the wind, raised
by {%Suparṇa's%} wings, brought celestial flowers of five colours
before the Pāṇḍavas towards the river {%Aśvarathā. Kṛṣṇā%}
expressed to {%Bhīma%} the wish of seeing the top of the
[Page765-b+ 63]
mountain when he had driven away the {%Rākṣasas. Bhīma%}
set out with bow, sword, and mace, and having ascended the
summit, thereby gladdening {%Kinnaras, Nāgas, Munis, Gan-%}
{%dharvas%}, and {%Rākṣasas%}, he blew his shell. {%Yakṣas%} and
{%Rākṣasas%} ({%Krodhavaśāḥ%}, v. 11757) assailed him with maces,
clubs, etc., but were killed or defeated, and the surviving
fled towards the south, forsaking their weapons. The
{%Rākṣasa Maṇimat%}, the friend of {%Kubera%}, in vain attempted
to recall them, and with clubs, javelins, etc., he rushed at
{%Bhīma%} and pierced his right arm with an iron spear with a
golden haft, but at last was killed by {%Bhīma%} with his mace.
The surviving {%Rākṣasas%} went towards the east (III, {@160@}).
—§ 438. Hearing various sounds and not seeing {%Bhīma%}, the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Kṛṣṇā%}, and {%Dhaumya%} and the brahmans were
filled with anxiety, and, entrusting {%Draupadī%} to the charge
of {%Ārṣṭiṣeṇa%}, they ascended the summit of the mountain
and embraced {%Bhīma%}, who was censured and again warned by
{%Yudhiṣṭhira. Kubera%}, on hearing about the matter from the
{%Rākṣasas%}, in anger let yoke his carriage, and, eulogized by
the gods and {%Gandharvas%}, and surrounded by 1,000 {%Yakṣas%},
he set out through the firmament to {%Gandhamādana%}, where
he seated himself on his seat {%Puṣpaka (b%}), surrounded by
{%Yakṣas, Rākṣasas, Gandharvas%}, and {%Apsarases%}, with his
noose and sword and bow, and asked {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} not to be
angry with {%Bhīma%} as {%Bhīma%} had only been the instrument of
destiny, and said to {%Bhīma%} that he did not mind his act of
rashness as he had thereby been delivered from the curse
of {%Agastya (c%}) (III, {@161@}). {%Kubera%} then gave {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
some wise counsel, referring to the {%Kṛta-yuga(d%}); he said,
that {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} ought to check the rashness of {%Bhīmasena%};
they should return to the hermitage of the R.-ṛ {%Ārṣṭiṣeṇa%}
and reside there during the first dark fortnight; the
inhabitants of {%Alakā%} with {%Gandharvas%}, and {%Yakṣas%} with
{%Kinnaras%}, etc., should, at the command of {%Kubera%}, protect
them, and his servants procure for them meat and drink;
he praised {%Arjuna (e). Arjuna%} would soon join them. Then
{%Kubera%} went to the mountain {%Asta%}, followed by thousands of
{%Yakṣas%} and {%Rākṣasas%} in vehicles drawn by horses flying in
the air. The dead bodies of the {%Rākṣasas%} were, at the
command of {%Kubera%}, removed. The {%Pāṇḍavas%} dwelt several
nights there, being honoured by the {%Rākṣasas%} (III, {@162@}).—
§ 439. At sunrise, {%Dhaumya%} and {%Ārṣṭiṣeṇa%} came to them,
and {%Dhaumya%}, seizing {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} hands, pointed out,
towards the east, the {%Mandara%} mountain, the east being the
region of {%Indra%} and {%Vaiśravaṇa%}, as the {%South%} is that of {%Yama%}
with his abode {%Saṃyamana%}, and the {%Asta%} mountain, where
the sun sets in the west, that of {%Varuṇa%}, together with the
ocean; in the north {%Meru%}, with the dwelling of {%Brahmán%},
where {%Prajāpati%} creates all creatures, and the seven mind-
born sons of {%Brahmán%} (of whom {%Dakṣa%} was the seventh),
and where the seven {%Devarṣis%} (i.e. {%Saptarṣayaḥ%}), with
{%Vasiṣṭha%} at their head, rise and set; next, to the east of
{%Meru%}, the abode of {%Nārāyaṇa%} or {%Viṣṇu%}, that cannot be seen
by gods or {%Dānavas%}, and where even {%Brahmarṣis%} have no
access, not to speak of {%Maharṣis%}, but only {%Yatis%}; thence,
they do not return to this world; {%Viṣṇu%} alone shines there.
Description of the revolving around {%Meru%} of the sun, moon,
and stars (“having coursed round {%Meru%}, the moon again
repairs to {%Mandara%}”, v. ii, 873) (III, {@163@}).—§ 440. The
{%Pāṇḍavas%} dwelled there for a month, visited by {%Gandharvas%}
and {%Maharṣis%}. A night and a day became to them like a
year, for since the departure of {%Arjuna%}, they had not felt
joy. After having dwelt for five years in the abode of {%Indra%}
[Page766-a+ 63]
and obtained all celestial weapons from him, {%Āgneya, Vāruṇa%},
{%Saumya, Vāyavya, Vaiṣṇava, Aindra, Pāśuvata, Brāhmya%},
{%Pārameṣṭhya%}, and those of {%Prajāpati, Yama, Dhātṛ, Savitṛ%},
{%Tvaṣṭṛ%}, and {%Vaiśravaṇa, Arjuna%} took leave of {%Indra%} and
came to {%Gandhamādana%} (III, {@164@}).
