{@Bhīmasenarasapāna(ṃ)@}¦ (“Bhīma's drinking the magic
draught”). § 197 (Sambhavap.): The {%Pāṇḍavas%} were far
superior in strength and skill to the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%}, and
{%Bhīma%} tormented the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras. Duryodhana%} then built
a palace ({%Udakakrīḍana%}) at {%Pramāṇakoṭi%}, on the banks of
the {%Gaṅgā%}, in order to sport in the water there. There he
invited the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and poured {%kālakūṭaka%} poison into the
food of {%Bhīma%}, and when {%Bhīma%} had lost his senses, {%Duryodhana%}
bound him and threw him into the water, where he sunk
down to the dwelling of the {%Nāgas%}, who bit him, but could
not penetrate his thick skin. The immovable (i.e. vegetable)
{%kālakūṭaka%} poison was neutralised by the movable (i.e. animal)
serpent poison. {%Bhīma%} awoke and began to crush the serpents,
until {%Vāsuki%} came, and, informed by {%Āryaka%} that he was the
daughter's son of {%Āryaka's%} daughter's son, let him drink
as much of their {%rasa%} (containing the strength of 1,000
elephants (serpents?) in each {%kuṇḍa%}) as he could. He drank
eight {%kuṇḍas%}, and then was laid on a bed (I, {@128@}). When
the {%Kauravas%} and {%Pāṇḍavas%} had returned to {%Hāstinapura%},
Yudhiṣṭhira (“himself unacquainted with wickedness, and
regarding others as honest as himself,” v. 5037) asked {%Kuntī%}
if {%Bhīma%} had come home. {%Vidura%} consoled her. On the eighth
day {%Bhīma%} awoke from his slumber, bathed in the holy waters,
ate of the {%paramānna%} (rice boiled in milk with sugar),
etc., and was placed by the {%Nāgas%} in the same gardens,
whence he ran home. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} ordered him to keep
silence on this accident, and the {%Pāṇḍavas%} [with {%Vidura's%}
advice] became very vigilant from this day (the words in
brackets are from B., where also v. 5068{%a%} is placed after
v. 5070{%a%}). [{%sārathiṃ cāsya dayitam apahastena jaghnivān%}
(see BR., s.v. {%apahasta%}, cf. iii, v. 545). {%Duryodhana%} again
poured {%kālakūṭaka%} poison into the food of {%Bhīma. Yuyutsu%}
informed the {%Pāṇḍavas%} of this; but {%Bhīma%} swallowed the
poison and digested it, and it produced no change in him.]—
{%Duryodhana, Karṇa%}, and {%Śakuni%} had recourse to numerous
other contrivances in order to kill the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, who, though
knowing it, yet, in accordance with the advice of {%Vidura%},
suppressed their indignation. Seeing the princes passing their
time in play, {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} appointed {%Gautama%} (i.e. {%Kṛpa%},
born in a thicket of reeds and well skilled in the meaning
of the {%Vedas%} and {%śāstras%}) as their preceptor (I, {@129@}).
