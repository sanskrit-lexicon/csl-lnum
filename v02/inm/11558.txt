{@Varāhāvatāra(ḥ)@}¦ (“Viṣṇu's incarnation as a boar”).
§ 422 bis (Gandhamādanapr.). Asked by {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
{%Lomaśa%} related: In the {%Kṛta yuga%}, when the primeval deity
({%Ādidevaḥ purātanaḥ%}) assumed the function of {%Yama%}, the
creatures did not die, and multiplied to such a degree that
the {%Earth%} sank 100 {%yojanas%}. She applied to {%Nārāyaṇa%}
(= Viṣṇu), who, in the shape of a boar with a single tusk
({%ekaśṛṅga%}), lifted her up by means of that. The gods,
with the {%ṛṣis%}, became afraid of the agitation produced, but
learnt the matter from {%Brahmán%}, and with him they went to
{%Nandana%}, there {%Viṣṇu%} was sitting in the shape of a boar
with {%Śrīvatsa%} on his breast, together with {%Suparṇa%}, and
having seen him they returned home (III, {@142@}).
