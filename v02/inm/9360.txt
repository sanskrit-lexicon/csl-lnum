[{@Saṃśaptakavadhaparvan(°va)@}]¦ (“the section re-
lating to the slaughter of the Saṃśaptakas,” the 72nd of the
minor parvans of the Mhbhr.; cf. Saṃśaptakavadha). § 591:
{%Droṇa%} confessed his inability to seize {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} if {%Arjuna%}
were by. The {%Trigarta%} king said that {%Arjuna%} had always
injured them, and took an oath that either {%Arjuna%} or the
{%Trigartas%} should be slain. This oath was taken by the five
brothers {%Satyaratha%}, etc., (α) with their 10,000 chariots, and by
the {%Mālava%} king, etc. (β). Then they summoned {%Arjuna%} towards
the southern part of the field. {%Arjuna%} told {%Satyajit%} to guard
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, and went out against the {%Trigartas%} (VII, {@17@}).
—§ 592: THE TWELFTH DAY'S BATTLE. The {%Saṃśaptakas%} rejoiced
at the prospect of fighting {%Arjuna%}, who addressed Kṛṣṇa
about this ill-timed joy, and terrified them with the sound of
{%Devadatta%}, and attacked them. {%Subāhu & Arjuna; Suśarman%},
etc. (α) & {%Arjuna%}; they fled to {%Duryodhana%}; but urged by
the {%Trigarta%} king, they once more returned to the field with
the {%Nārāyaṇa%} cowherds (VII, {@18@}). {%Kṛṣṇa%} conveyed
{%Arjuna%} to the {%Saṃśaptakas%}. The {%Nārāyaṇas & Arjuna%}
({%+ Kṛṣṇa); Arjuna%} blew {%Devadatta%} and employed the
{%Tvāṣṭra%} weapon, that confounded the foes, who began to
fight each other; {%Arjuna%} crushed the {%Lalitthas%}, etc. (β), and
with the {%Vāyavya%} weapon he dispersed the arrows shot by
his foes, and {%Vāyu%} blew away crowds of {%Saṃśaptakas%} with
their steeds, etc. Meanwhile {%Droṇa%} attacked {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
(VII, {@19@}). {%Droṇa%} had arrayed his troops in the shape
of a {%garuḍa: Droṇa%} in the mouth; {%Duryodhana%} and his
brothers = the head; {%Kṛtararman%} and {%Kṛpa%} = the two eyes;
{%Bhūtaśarman%}, etc. (γ), in its neck; {%Bhūriśravas%}, etc. (δ), in
the right wing; {%Vinda%}, etc. (ε), in the left wing before
{%Aśvatthāman%}; in the back the {%Kaliṅgas%}, etc. (ζ); in the tail
{%Karṇa%} with his sons, etc.; {%Jayadratha%}, etc. (η), in the bosom;
in the midst the {%Prāgjyotiṣa%} king. {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} disposed
his troops in the shape of a semicircle. {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna &%}
{%Droṇa + Duṛmukha Dhārtarāṣṭra; Droṇa%} dispersed {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira's%} host (VII, {@20@}). {%Droṇa & Yudhiṣṭhira + Satyajit +%}
{%Vṛka; Satyajit%} was slain by {%Droṇa; Yudhiṣṭhira%} fled. The
{%Pāñcālas%}, etc. (θ), attacked {%Droṇa%}, and were consumed; {%Śatā-%}
{%nīka%} (younger brother of the {%Matsya%} king) & {%Droṇa%}, who
slew him; the {%Matsyas%} fled. {%Droṇa%} defeated the {%Cedis%}, etc. (ι).
{%Yudhiṣṭhira & Droṇa; Śikhaṇḍin%}, etc. (κ), & {%Droṇa; Droṇa%}
slew {%Kṣema. Yudhiṣṭhira%} fled away. {%Droṇa%} slew {%Pāñcālya%}
({%Pāñcālyanāmnā%}, Nīl.). {%Droṇa%} crushed the {%Pāñcālas%},
etc. (λ), and, supported by the {%Kurus%}, he vanquished
{%Sātyaki%}, etc. (μ). The {%Pāṇḍavas%} fled away in all directions
(VII, {@21@}). {%Duryodhana%} addressed {%Karṇa%} in joy, beholding
the {%Pāñcālas%}, etc. (ν), broken by {%Droṇa%}, and {%Bhīmasena%}
abandoned by the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and the {%Sṛñjayas. Karṇa%} said
that {%Bhīmasena%}, followed by {%Sātyaki%}, etc. (ξ), would never
leave the fight; {%Duryodhana%} proceeded to {%Droṇa's%} chariot,
[Page612-a+ 63]
where a deafening noise was heard of {%Pāṇḍava%} warriors
returning to the fight (VII, {@22@}). At the request of
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Sañjaya%} described the steeds of {%Bhīmasena%},
etc. (ο), especially mentioning {%Bṛhanta (b%}); the standards of
{%Droṇa%}, etc. (π), and the bows of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (ρ) (VII,
{@23@}). The despondency of {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}, mentioning {%Bhīma%},
etc. (σ) (VII, {@24@}). When the {%Pāṇḍavas%} returned to fight
and attacked {%Droṇa%}, the {%Kurus%} were afraid. {%Duryodhana%}
urged his troops against them. {%Durmarṣaṇa Dhārtarāṣṭra%}
{%& Bhīma; Kṛtavarman & Yuyudhāna%}; the {%Sindhu%} king &
{%Kṣatravarman; Subāhu & Yuyutsu%}, who cut off the two
arms of {%Subāhu; Śalya & Yudhiṣṭhira; Bāhlīka & Drupada%};
{%Vinda%} and {%Anuvinda & Virāṭa%}; that encounter between the
{%Matsyas%} and the {%Kekayas%} resembled that between D. and As.
in days of old; {%Bhūtakarman Sabhāpati & Nakula's%} son
{%Śatānīka; Bhūtakarman%} was slain by {%Śatānīka; Viviṃśati &%}
{%Sutasoma; Bhīmaratha (Dhārṭarāṣṭra%}) slew {%Śālva; Citra-%}
{%sena's%} son & {%Śrutakarman; Prativindhya & Aśvatthāman%}; the
son of {%Duḥśāsana & Śrutakīrti%} (the son of {%Arjuna%} by
{%Draupadī%}); {%Lakṣmaṇa%} (son of {%Duryodhana%}) & {%Paṭaccarahantṛ%};
{%Vikarṇa (Dhārtarāṣṭra) & Śikhaṇḍin; Aṅgada & Uttamaujas%};
{%Durmukha & Purujit; Karṇa%} & the five {%Kekaya%} brothers;
{%Durjaya + Jaya + Vijaya (Dhārtarāṣṭrāḥ) & Nīla +%} the
{%Kāśi%} king + {%Jayatsena; Kṣemadhūrti + Bṛhanta & Sātyaki%};
the {%Cedi%} king & {%Ambaṣṭha; Kṛpa & Vārdhakṣemi; Soma—%}
{%datta's%} son & {%Maṇimat; Vṛṣasena%} (the son of {%Karṇa%}) &
{%Pāṇḍya; Ghaṭotkaca & Alambuṣa%} (VII, {@25@}); {%Duryodhana &%}
{%Bhīmasena%}; the {%Aṅga%} king (Mleccha king) & do.; {%Bhīma%} slew
him, and his divisions fied; the {%Prāgjyotiṣa%} king (upon his
elephant {%Supratīka%}) & {%Bhīma%} (who knew the {%añjalikāvedha%});
{%Bhīma%} escaped from the elephant, but was supposed to have
been slain; {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (+ the {%Pāñcālas%}) & {%Bhagadatta%}
(upon {%Supratīka%}); the {%Daśārṇa%} king (upon his elephant) &
{%Bhagadatta; Bhagadatta & Yuyudhāna; Bhagadatta%} destroyed
the {%Pāṇḍava%} troops; {%Bhīma & Bhagadatta%}, whose elephant
frightened {%Bhīma's%} steeds, that bore {%Bhīma%} away; {%Ruciparvan%}
({%Kṛtī-sutaḥ) & Bhagadatta%}, who slew him; {%Abhimanyu%}, etc.
(τ), & {%Bhagadatta's%} elephant; {%Yuyutsu%} had his steeds and
charioteer trod down and fled; {%Duryodhana(?) & Abhimanyu%};
{%Arjuna%}, etc. (υ) & {%Bhagadatta%}; the {%Pāṇḍava%} troops fled
(VII, {@26@}). Urged by {%Arjuna, Kṛṣṇa%} began to proceed
against {%Bhagadatta%}; the {%Saṃśaptakas%} (10,000 {%Trigartas%} and
4,000 {%Nārāyaṇāḥ (Vāsudevasyānugāḥ%})) challenged {%Arjuna%}, and
he encountered them, shot the {%Brāhma%} weapon, defeated and
slew them, and then turned against {%Bhagadatta%} (VII, {@27@});
but as {%Suśarman%} with his brothers followed him from behind,
he again attacked {%Suśarman%}, and then again {%Bhagadatta%} (VII,
{@28@}); {%Bhagadatta%}, at last, by means of {%mantras%} changed his
hook into the {%Vaiṣṇava%} weapon, which, received by {%Kṛṣṇa%}
on his breast, became a garland. As {%Arjuna%} taxed {%Kṛṣṇa%}
for his taking part in the battle, {%Kṛṣṇa%} related the history
of the {%Vaiṣṇavāstra (c%}). “The great {%Asura%} has now been
divested of that supreme weapon; now slay {%Bhagadatta%},
that enemy of the gods, even as I formerly for the benefit
of the worlds slew the {%Asura Naraka.”%} {%Arjuna%} then slew
both {%Bhagadatta%} (who was ever the favourite and friend
of {%Indra%}, v. 1302), and the elephant (VII, {@29@}). Then
{%Arjuna%} slew the two brothers {%Vṛṣa[ka]%} and {%Acala%} (sons of
the {%Gāndhāra%} king {%Subala%}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%} sons attacked
{%Arjuna%}, and {%Śakuni%} created illusions in order to confound
him and {%Kṛṣṇa%}: clubs, etc., and asses, etc., which {%Arjuna%}
slew with celestial weapons; then darkness, whence pro-
ceeded harsh voices; this {%Arjuna%} dispelled with the weapon
[Page612-b+ 63]
{%Jyotiṣka%}; then waves of water, dried up with the {%Āditya%}
weapon; {%Śakuni%} fled. {%Arjuna%} slaughtered the {%Kuru%} army:
one stream proceeded towards {%Droṇa%}, one towards {%Duryodhana%};
a fierce battle took place on the southern side between
{%Arjuna%} and the {%Kurus%}. The various divisions of {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira's%} force smote the foe on every part of the field (VII,
{@30@}). {%Droṇa%} + the {%Kurus & Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (ϕ), + the
{%Pāṇḍavas; Nīla & Aśvatthāman%}, who slew him; the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
regretted that {%Arjuna%} was engaged in the southern part of
the field in slaughtering the {%Saṃśaptakas%} and the {%Nārāyaṇa%}
force (VII, {@31@}). {%Bhīmasena & Bāhlīka + Karṇa; Droṇa%},
etc. (χ) & {%Bhīma; Yudhiṣṭhira%} despatched {%Nakula%}, etc. (ψ),
to the rescue of {%Bhīma; Bhīma%}, etc., & {%Droṇa%}; the {%Pāṇḍavas%},
etc. (ω) & {%Droṇa%}, etc. (αα). {%Arjuna%}, having slain the
{%Saṃśaptakas, & Droṇa%} + the {%Kurus + Arjuna%}, who employed
the {%Āgneya%} weapon; {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, etc. (ββ) & {%Karṇa%};
{%Arjuna%} slew three of {%Karṇa's%} brothers (γγ); {%Bhīma%} slew
fifteen of {%Karṇa's%} combatants; {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} slew {%Candra-%}
{%varman%}, etc. (δδ); {%Duryodhana%}, etc. (εε) & {%Sātyaki%}, rescuing
{%Karṇa; Dhṛṣṭadyumna%}, etc. (ζζ) protected {%Sātyaki%}. At
sunset the armies retired (VII, {@32@}).
