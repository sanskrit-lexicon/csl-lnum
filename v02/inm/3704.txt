[{@Drupadaśāsana(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the chastising of Drupada”).
§ 209 (Sambhavap.): {%Droṇa%} now one day asked the {%Dhārta-%}
{%rāṣṭras%} and {%Pāṇḍavas%} for his fee as their instructor, saying:
“Seize ye the {%Pāñcāla%} king {%Drupada%} in battle and bring him
to me.” {%Duryodhana, Karṇa, Yuyutsu, Duḥśāsana, Vikarṇa%},
{%Jalasandha, Sulocana, Subāhu, Dīrghalocana%}, etc., smote the
{%Pāñcālas%} and conquered the capital of {%Drupada%}, while {%Arjuna%},
etc., waited outside the town at a distance of half a {%krośa%},
thinking that the others were not able to seize {%Drupada%}.
Defeated by {%Drupada%}, they fell back upon the {%Pāṇḍavas%}.
{%Arjuna%}, bidding {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} not to engage in the fight,
appointed the sons of {%Mādrī%} his {%cakrarakṣas%}, while {%Bhīmasena%},
mace in hand, ran ahead to slay the elephants, while
{%Arjuna%} attacked the {%Pāñcālas%} and {%Sṛñjayas%} and felled
{%Drupada%} from his elephant. {%Drupada%} and {%Satyajit%} rushed
at {%Arjuna. Satyajit%} had his bows repeatedly cut in twain
and his horses, etc., slain, and desisted from the fight.
[Page271-b+ 63]
{%Drupada%} also had his bow cut in twain, etc., by {%Arjuna%},
who then took a scimitar and, leaping from his own chariot
upon that of his foe, seized {%Drupada%}, while the {%Pāñcālas%} ran
away. {%Bhīma%}, etc., began to lay waste his capital, but were
prevented by {%Arjuna. Droṇa%} prevailed upon {%Drupada%} to
accept his friendship, and restored half his kingdom to him, viz.,
that part of it that lay on the southern side of the {%Bhāgīrathī%},
with the southern {%Pāñcālas%}, up to the banks of the {%Carmaṇvatī%}
river, where {%Drupada%} thenceforth resided sorrowfully in
{%Kāmpilya%} in {%Mākandī%}, on the banks of {%Gaṅgā%}, while {%Droṇa%}
(because {%Drupada%} had said that only a king could be the
friend of a king) retained that half that lay to the north of the
{%Bhāgīrathī%}, and thenceforth continued to reside in {%Ahicchatra%}
(I, {@138@}).
