taken with holy rites and invocations. When Puloman began
to carry her away Cyavana dropped from her womb, and
Puloman was instantly converted into ashes. Of her tears
Brahmán formed the river Vadhūsara. Bhṛgu cursed Agni,
saying, “thou shalt eat of all things.” Agni, enraged at
the curse, withdrew himself from the sacrifice, wherefore all
creatures became much distressed. Brahmán appeased Agni
by promising that only his less noble form (the digestive fire

enamoured of the wives of the seven Ṛṣis, at first entered
their gārhapatya fire, then after a long time retired to the
forest ({%vanam%}; Nīl. says nothing) in order to destroy himself;
Svāhā, who had loved him in vain, cohabited with him,
successively assuming the guise of the wives of the Ṛṣis
(six of the Kṛttikās or Pleiads) except Arundhatī, and going
out of the forest in the guise of a bird (Garuḍī, Suparṇī,
Vinatā) she threw the semen in a golden basin on the Śveta
mountain; this took place on the Amāvasyā day; on the
Pratipad day the semen became an embryo (Skanda); on the
fourth day Skanda was fully developed. The six wives of
the Ṛṣis were divorced by their husbands. Skanda is called
the son of Rudra, because Agni is called Rudra by brahmans,
and because he was produced by Rudra entering Fire (and
Umā coalescing with Svāhā), etc., and the Śveta mountain
was formed of Rudra's semen virile. Agni gave to Skanda
a red cock, that formed his ensign perched on the top of his
chariot. The six divorced wives of the Ṛṣis, together with
Vinatā, obtained from Skanda that they became his mothers.
At the request of Indra they (incl. of Vinatā, see v. 14464
and Nīl., i.e. the Kṛttikās) were placed among the Nakṣatras
(and presided by Agni) instead of Abhijit (q.v.). Brahmán
ordered that time should be reckoned from Dhaniṣṭhā, while
it had formerly been reckoned from Rohiṇī (so Nīl.). Svāhā
prevailed upon Skanda that she should live for ever with
Agni, in so far as offerings with mantras to the gods and Pitṛs

cf. XII, {@78@}, 2922): Brahmán had granted the Asura Tāṛaka
the boon that he could not be slain by gods, Asuras,
Rākṣasas, etc., and the deities had, in consequence of their
endeavour in former times to stop propagation, been cursed
by Pārvatī, that they were not to have any offspring;
but Agni had not been there; he therefore, said Brahmán,
would beget an offspring for the destruction of Tāraka, etc.:
“Kāma is Rudra's seed, a portion of which fell into Agni,
who will cast it into Gaṅgā. Therefore, make a search for
Agni. Agni is the most eternal of all creatures; he is older
than Rudra himself,” etc. After searching in vain every part
of the universe, the gods successively learnt from a frog that
had been scorched by the energy of Agni that he was residing
in the nethermost regions of the water; from an elephant, that
he was within an aśvattha tree; and from a parrot, that he
had entered the heart of a śamī tree. All frogs, elephants, and
parrots were cursed by Agni and blessed by the gods in various
ways: the śamī tree the gods made a sacred fuel fit for
producing fire in all religious rites; the heated waters that
are found in the nethermost regions are vomited forth by the
mountain springs. Agni then united himself in spiritual
congress with Gaṅgā, who, being unable to bear the seed, cast
it off resplendent like gold on the breast of Meru, on a forest
of reeds. Hence Agni was called Hiraṇyaretas; Earth,
Vasumatī; the child, Skanda and Guha, and, because it was
nursed by the Kṛttikās, Kārttikeya; gold, Jātarūpa. It was
in this way that gold came into existence as the offspring of
Agni; gold is truly the illustrious Agni, the lord of all
things, and the foremost of all Prajāpatis; the most sacred of
all sacred things is gold; it has for its essence Agni and Soma.
In days of yore ({%lokādau%}, v. 4163) Rudra (who is Brahmán,
Śiva, Rudra, Varuṇa, Agni, Prajāpati, etc.), having assumed
the form of Varuṇa (cf. v. 4133, {%Varuṇaḥ, Pavanātmakaḥ%}),
performed a sacrifice to which came the munis and all the
deities with Agni, etc.; the Lord of all himself poured
libations into his own self. Seeing {%“devapatnyaś ca kanyāś%}
{%ca devānāñ caiva mātaraḥ,”%} the seed (endowed with Sattva,
Rajas, and Tamas) of Brahmán fell upon the Earth; Pūṣan
took it up, and it was taken with the sacrificial ladle and
poured as an oblation into the fire; thence Brahmán caused
the different beings to spring into existence. From the flames
[Page022-a+ 63]

({%prajānāṃ patayaḥ%}), the Ṛṣis from his pores, etc. For this
reason Agni is said to be all the deities; the pieces of wood
are the months, etc.; his bile ({%pittam%}) is day and night
(B. somewhat differently); {%“Raudraṃ lohityam ity āhur%},
{%lohitāt kanakaṃ smṛtaṃ|tan Maitram iti vijñeyaṃ, dhūmāc%}

were all of them {%prajānam patayaḥ%}; their offspring (v. 4144—52)

Agni is Brahmán, Paśupati, Sarva, Rudra, Prajāpati; gold
is the offspring of Agni (v. 4164); when fire is not obtainable
gold is used as a substitute by a {%Jāmadagnyaḥ%} (“one that knows

not from any desire of wealth, but only that he might do
what was disagreeable to Indra and Bṛhaspati. Marutta
succeeded in obtaining from Śiva the gold on Muñjavat, and
made arrangements for the sacrifice. Bṛhaspati became sick
with jealousy, and Indra therefore despatched Agni to Marutta
to say that Bṛhaspati would officiate at his sacrifice and make
him immortal, etc. But Marutta answered that he did not
desire these things, and Saṃvartta threatened to burn Agni
with his fierce evil ({%dāruṇena%}) eyes if he should ever come
again. At last Indra himself directed the sacrifice. Indra
told Marutta to offer a red bull consecrated to Agni, and
