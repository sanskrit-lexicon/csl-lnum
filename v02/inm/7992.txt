{@Pāṇḍavapraveśaparvan@}¦ (“the section relating to the
entrance of the Pāṇḍavas”). § 549: Questioned by
{%Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana%} related: Having obtained boons
from {%Dharma, Yudhiṣṭhira%} returned to the hermitage and
restored to the brahman his {%araṇī%} and {%mantha%}. Then he
asked {%Arjuna%} to select some spot where they might dwell
undiscovered. {%Arjuna%} mentioned some countries surrounding
the kingdom of the {%Kurus%} (α). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} chose the
city of king {%Virāṭa%}, who was attached to the {%Pāṇḍavas%}.
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} would introduce himself as a brahman named
{%Kaṅka%}, who was skilled in dice and had been the friend of
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (IV, {@1@}). {%Bhīmasena%} as a cook and wrestler
named {%Vallava%}, who had served {%Yudhiṣṭhira; Arjuna (b-e%})
as a hermaphrodite, {%Bṛhannalā%} by name, who had served
{%Kṛṣṇā%} as a waiting-maid (IV, {@2@}). {%Nakula%} as a keeper of
horses, named {%Granthika%}, who had formerly been employed
by {%Yudhiṣṭhira; Sahadeva%} as a cowherd, named {%Tantripāla%};
{%Kṛṣṇā%} would serve {%Sudeṣṇā%} (the queen of {%Virāṭa%}) as a
{%sairindhrī%}, skilled in dressing hair, who had waited upon
{%Kṛṣṇa%} (IV, {@3@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} said: “Let our priest, with
our charioteers and cooks, repair to the abode of {%Drupaḍa%}
and there maintain our {%agnihotra%} fires, and {%Indrasena%}, etc.,
with the empty chariots proceed to {%Dvāravatī%}, and the maid-
servants go to the {%Pāñcālas%}, together with the charioteers
and the cooks. Let all of them say that the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
had left them at the {%Dvaitavana%} lake.” {%Dhaumya%} advised
the {%Pāṇḍavas%} as to how they should behave at court and
performed the rites ordained in respect of departure, and
then set out for the {%Pāñcālas%}, taking with him their sacred
fires; {%Indrasena%}, etc., proceeded to the {%Yādavas%} (IV, {@4@}).
The {%Pāṇḍavas%} then proceeded in the direction of the
southern bank of the river {%Kālindī%} and passed through
the countries of the {%Yakṛllomas%} and the {%Śūrasenas%}, leaving
behind on the right the country of the {%Pāñcālas%} and on the
left that of the {%Daśārṇas. Arjuna%} carried {%Kṛṣṇā%}. When
they had reached the capital of {%Virāṭa, Arjuna%}, as {%Gāṇḍīva%}
was known to all men, caused them to stow away their
weapons in a {%śamī-%}tree near a cemetery. Nakula ascended
the tree and tied the weapons fast. In the tree they hung
up a corpse and said to the inquirers: “This is our mother,
aged 180 years.” They kept for themselves the names {%Jaya%},
{%jayanta, Vijaya, Jayatsena, Jayadbala%} (IV, {@5@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}
praised {%Durgā (f%}), who then showed herself to him and
promised him victory, etc. (IV, {@6@}). They then entered the
city and were successively received by {%Virāṭa. Yudhiṣṭhira%}
(naming himself {%Kaṅka Vaiyāghrapadya%}) was accepted as
a courtier (IV, {@7@}). {%Bhīmasena%} (naming himself {%Vallava%})
was accepted as a cook and a wrestler (IV, {@8@}). {%Kṛṣṇā%} was
seen by the queen {%Sudeṣṇā Kaikeyī%} and accepted as a
{%sairindhrī%}; she said: “My five husbands, who are {%Gandharvas%}
and sons of a {%Gandharva%} king, always protect me” (IV, {@9@}).
{%Sahadeva%} came clad in a cowherd's dress and speaking the
dialect of cowherds, and said that he was a {%vaiśya%} named
{%Ariṣṭanemi%}. He was accepted as the king's head cowherd
(IV, {@10@}). Then {%Arjuna%} appeared dressed as an eunuch and
naming himself {%Bṛhannalā%}, and was accepted as a dancing
master (IV, {@11@}). {%Nakula%}, who named himself {%Granthika%}, like-
wise was accepted as the king's head horsekeeper (IV, {@12@}).
