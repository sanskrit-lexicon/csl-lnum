{@Aurvopākhyāna(ṃ)@}¦ (“the episode relating to Aurva”).
§ 227 (Parāśara): King Kṛtavīrya, the {%yājya%} of the {%Bhṛgus%},
at the end of the {%Soma%} sacrifice gratified the {%brahmans%}
with large offerings. After he had ascended to heaven, it
came to happen that his descendants were in want of wealth.
Knowing that the {%Bhṛgus%} were rich, they went to them and
begged. Some amongst the {%Bhṛgus%} buried their wealth
under the earth, some gave it away to {%brahmans%}, and some
duly gave it to the {%kṣattriyas%}. Some {%kṣattriyas%}, while
digging at the house of a {%Bhārgava%}, came upon a large
treasure. The {%kṣattriyas%} then began to kill the {%Bhṛgus%}
with their arrows all over the earth, even the embryos.
A {%Bhṛgu%} woman fled to {%Himavat%}, holding an embryo in
one of her thighs (“for 100 years,” v. 6822). From fear
a {%brahman%} woman reported this to the {%kṣattriyas%}. The
{%kṣattriyas%} then went to destroy that embryo, which, how-
ever, came out, tearing open the thigh and dazzling the eyes
of the {%kṣattriyas%} so that they lost their sight. They asked
the woman that they might be restored to sight, promising to
abstain from their sinful practice (I, {@178@}). She told them
to ask the child, which they did, and regaining their eye-
sights they went away. The child ({%viprarṣi%}) was named
{%Aurva%}, because he had been born after tearing open his
mother's thigh ({%ūru). Aurva%} devoted himself to the austerest
of penances with the object of destroying the whole world to
gratify his ancestors. The {%Pitṛs%} then all came from {%Pitṛloka%},
and said: “Be propitious towards the three worlds. Having
grown weary with the long periods of life allotted to us, we
desired our own destruction through the {%kṣattriyas%}. Such
as commit suicide never attain to regions that are blessed,
therefore we abstained from self-destruction” (I, {@179@}).
When {%Aurva%} replied that his vow must not be in vain, the
{%Pitṛs%} prevailed upon him to throw his wrath into the waters
of the ocean, the whole universe being made of water. It
became a large horse-head, which, emitting fire from its
mouth, consumes the waters of the ocean (I, {@180@}).—
§ 228: Hearing this the {%viprarṣi%} Parāśara controlled his
wrath from destroying the worlds. But he performed
a great {%rākṣasa%} sacrifice and began to burn the {%rākṣasas%}
in it, and {%Vasiṣṭha%} did not restrain him. Desirous of
ending that sacrifice the {%ṛṣi Atri%} came to that place, and
also {%Pulastya%} and {%Pulaha%} and {%Kratu%}, desiring to save the
{%rākṣasas%}. Seeing that many {%rākṣasas%} had already been
slain, {%Pulastya%} said: “That which befell thy father was
brought about by his own curse! No {%rākṣasa%} was capable
of devouring {%Śakti%}; he himself provided for his own death!
{%Viśvāmitra%} was only a blind instrument in that matter.
Both {%Śakti%} and {%Kalmāṣapāda%} have ascended to heaven,
and are enjoying great happiness, as also the other sons of
{%Vasiṣṭha%}. Abandon this sacrifice of thine.” {%Parāśara%} then
brought his sacrifice to an end, and threw the fire into the
woods on the north of the {%Himavat%}, where it may be seen to
this day consuming {%rākṣasas%} and trees and stones in all
seasons ({%parvaṇi parvaṇi%}) (I, {@181@}).
