[{@Satyavatīlābhopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode relating
how Śāntanu got Satyavatī”). § 165 (cf. Āpavop.):
Description of {%Śāntanu%}, the princes anointed him as “King of
Kings” ({%rājarājya%}, v. 3974); he ruled the earth from {%Hāsti-%}
{%napura%}, the town ({%puṭabhedana%}) of the {%Kurus%} (v. 3978);
there was no killing of deer, boars, etc., under his reign
(cf. § 162!) except for the sacrifices to the gods, {%ṛṣis%},
and {%pitṛs%}. For thirty-six years he, without enjoying the
love of women, roamed about in the woods, and his son,
{%Gāṅgeya Devarata%}, the {%Vasu%}, was equal to him. One day,
when pursuing a deer he had wounded along the banks of the
{%Gaṅgā%}, he saw a youth who, with a heavenly weapon, checked
the flow of the {%Gaṅgā%}. It was his son who, knowing him, but
not known by him, and clouding his perception by illusion
({%māyā%}), suddenly disappeared. On {%Śāntanu's%} prayer, {%Gangā%}
appeared holding the boy, and having told him that he was
his son, and that he had studied all the {%Vedas%} and their {%Aṅgas%}
with {%Vasiṣṭha%} and knew all {%śāstras%} that were known by
{%Uśanas%} and {%Bṛhaspati%} (adored by the gods and {%Asuras%}), and
by the {%ṛṣi Rāma Jāmadagnya%}, and also the {%rājadharmas%}, she
let him take him to his capital, where he was installed as
heir-apparent. After four years {%Śāntanu%} met with {%Satyavatī%}
in the wood on the banks of {%Yamunā%}, and demanded her hand
from her father, the king of the fishermen ({%dāśarāja%}), who
would not consent unless {%Śāntanu%} would promise that his son
by {%Satyavatī%} should become his successor on the throne.
{%Śāntanu%} would not grant the boon, but returned to {%Hāsti-%}
{%napura%} and passed his time in sorrow until {%Devavrata%}, having
learned from the old minister the cause of his grief, by
declaring that he would adopt the vow of {%brahmacarya%}
(including celibacy), prevailed upon the fisherman (who had
formerly rejected the {%Devarṣi Asita%}, because {%Parāśara%} had
pointed out to him {%Śāntanu%} as a suitable husband for her),
that he gave {%Satyavatī%} to {%Śāntanu%}, while the gods and {%ṛṣis%}
showered flowers upon {%Devavrata%}, calling him {%Bhīṣma%}.
{%Bhīṣma%} then took the maiden to {%Hāstinapura%} on his chariot,
and {%Śāntanu%} bestowed upon him the boon of death at choice
(I, {@100@}). (For continuation v. Citrāṅgadop.)
