[{@Ulūkadūtāgamanaparvan(°va)@}]¦ (“the section re-
lating to Ulūka's arrival as an ambassador,” the 64th of the
minor parvans of Mhbhr.; cf. Ulūkadūtāgamana). § 571.
When the {%Pāṇḍavas%} had encamped on the bank of the
{%Hiraṇvatī%}, the {%Kauravas%} also fixed their encampment. Then
{%Duryodhana%} consulted with {%Karṇa%}, etc. (α), and sent {%Ulūka%}
to the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and {%Somakas%} in order to irritate them still
more, with insulting messages to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (the story of
the wicked cat), {%Kṛṣṇa%}, etc. (β); before {%Arjuna%} he should
mention the {%Kāmbojas%}, etc. (γ), among his troops; “I know
that the {%Gāṇḍīva%} is full 6 cubits long” (V, {@160@}). {%Ulūka%}
repeated the messages to the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, etc. (V, {@161@}), and
repeated his words to {%Arjuna%} once more; {%Bhīmasena%} and the
rest became furious; {%Kṛṣṇa%} counselled {%Ulūka%} to retire in
time; {%Ulūka%} once more repeated his words; they became
still more enraged, especially {%Bhīma%}, who said that he would
certainly drink {%Duḥśāsana's%} blood; also {%Sahadeva%}, etc. (δ),
gave him answers for {%Duryodhana; Sahadeva%} would slay
{%Ulūka%} before the eyes of {%Śakuni%}, and then {%Śakuni%} himself
(V, {@162@}). {%Arjuna%} said that {%Duryodhana's%} contrivance of
seeking cover behind {%Bhīṣma%} would be of no avail, as he
would himself slay {%Bhīṣma%}; the same said {%Śikhaṇḍin%} (“I
have been created by the Creator for the destruction of
{%Bhīṣma%}”); {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} would slay {%Droṇa%} with all his
followers and friends. {%Ulūka%} related it all to {%Duryodhana%}.
Messengers instructed by {%Karṇa%} promulgated: “array to-
morrow before sunrise” (V, {@163@}). {%Dhṛṣṭadyumna%} began to
select combatants in order to pit them against particular
warriors of the hostile force (ε) (V, {@164@}).
