[{@Indradyumnopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“history of Indra-
dyumna”). § 468 (Mārk.): The {%Pāṇḍavas%} asked {%Mārkaṇḍeya%}
“Is there anybody that is older than thou?” He related:
“The {%rājarṣi Indradyumna%}, who had fallen from heaven,
complained that his fame must have passed away, and asked
me if I recognized him; as I did not, he became a horse
[Page341-b+ 63]
and carried me to the {%Himavat%} to the owl {%Prāvārakarṇa%}, who
was older than I; the owl we took to the lake {%Indradyumna%}
to the crane {%Nāḍījaṅgha%}, who was older than the owl; the
crane indicated us the tortoise {%Akūpāra%} in the same lake.
{%Akūpāra%} knew {%Indradyumna%}, and said that {%Indradyumna%} had
planted the {%yūpa%} 1,000 times, and that this lake had been
excavated by the feet of the cows given away by him to the
brahmans. Then a chariot came from heaven, and a celestial
voice called {%Indradyumna%} back to heaven (vv. 13343—5, three
{%ślokas%} are cited; v. 13343: ‘The report of a virtuous deed
reaches heaven and earth; as long as that report is heard, so
long is the doer said to be in heaven’). He first brought
me and the owl to our respective places, and then went away
in that chariot.” The {%Pāṇḍavas%} praised {%Mārkaṇḍeya%} for
having caused {%Indradyumna%} to regain his sphere; he said that
{%Kṛṣṇa%} also had raised the {%rājarṣi Nṛga%} from hell and caused
him to regain heaven (III, {@199@}).
