{@[Lokapālasabhākhyānaparvan]@}¦ (“the section con-
taining the description of the palaces of the Lokapālas,”
the 21st of the minor parvans of the Mahābhārata). (Cf.
Lokapālasabhākhyāna.)—§ 265: While the {%Pāṇḍavas%} were
sitting in that palace, with the great {%Gandharvas%}, there came
unto them the {%devarṣi Nārada%} (his accomplishments are
enumerated at great length), having wandered over the
different worlds, accompanied by the {%ṛṣis Pārijāta, Raivata%},
{%Sumukta%}, and {%Saumya. Nārada%} informed {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} about
religion, pleasure, and profit, in the form of questions about
his conduct. By following his advice {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} conquered
the whole earth (II, {@5@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} answered that he
observed all those rules. Then he asked {%Nārada%} if he had
ever seen a palace like his. {%Nārada%} ({%Brahmaṛṣiḥ%}, v. 281)
replied that no palace among men was like his, but that he
would describe unto him the palaces of {%Pitṛrāja%} (i.e. {%Yama%}),
{%Varuṇa, Indra%}, the dweller on {%Kailāsa%} (i.e. {%Kubera%}), and
{%Brahmán%}, always worshipped by gods, {%Pitṛs%} and {%Sādhyas%}, etc.
(II, {@6@}).—§ 266: {%Śakrasabhāvarṇana%} (q.v.).—§ 267: {%Yama-%}
{%sabhāvarṇana%} (q.v.).—§ 268: {%Varuṇasabhāvarṇana%} (q.v.).—
§ 269: {%Vaiśravaṇasabhāvarṇana%} (q.v.).—§ 270: {%Brahma-%}
{%sabhāvarṇana%} (q.v.).—§ 271: {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} said: It appears
that almost all the monarchs are in the sabhā of {%Yama%}—the
{%Nāgas, Daityas%}, rivers, and oceans in that of {%Varuṇa%}—the
{%Yakṣas, Guhyakas, Rākṣasas, Gandharvas, Apsarases%}, and
{%Śiva%} in that of {%Kubera%}—the great {%ṛṣis%}, and gods, and {%śāstras%}
in that of {%Pitāmaha%} (i.e. {%Brahmán%}); and in that of {%Śakra%}
(i.e. {%Indra%}) gods, {%Gandharvas%} and various {%ṛṣis%}, but only one
king, the {%rājarṣi Hariścandra (b%}); this is explained by
{%Nārada. Pāṇḍu%}, beholding the good fortune of {%Hariścandra%},
had asked {%Nārada%} to tell {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} to subjugate the
whole earth and then perform a {%rājasūya%}. Thereby also
{%Pāṇḍu%} and his ancestors would go to the region of {%Indra%}.
{%Brahmarakṣases%}, that destroy the sacrifices, always look
for opportunities of obstructing it. Then {%Nārada%} went away
to the city of the {%Dāśārhas%}, accompanied by the {%ṛṣis%} with
whom he had come (II, {@12@}).
