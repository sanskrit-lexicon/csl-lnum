[{@Bali-Vāsava-saṃvāda(ḥ)@}]¦ (“the discourse between
Bali and Indra”). ({%a%}) § 671{%b%} (Mokṣadh.): One day, after
having subjugated all As., {%Indra%} asked {%Brahmán%} where
{%Bali%} now was, he who was {%Vāyu%}, etc. (α). {%Brahmán%} said
that {%Bali%} might now have taken his birth among camels or
bulls, etc., and be staying in a deserted house; he told
{%Indra%} not to slay him, but to ask him for instruction
in morality. {%Indra%} roamed over the earth on {%Airāvata%},
and found {%Bali%} in a deserted house in the form of an ass.
{%Indra%} scoffed at him, and asked if he did not grieve, and
where his 42,000 {%Gandharvas%} had gone who in former days
used to dance before him, and also about the garland given
to him by {%Brahmán. Bali%} said: “When thou becomest like
me, thou wilt not indulge in speech like this” (XII, {@223@}).
{%Bali%} said that D., men, P., G., snakes, and Rā. were under
his sway in days gone by, and that all creatures used to
flatter him; but he did not grieve at all; in reality it is Time
that creates and destroys all things, though living creatures
brag of doing this or that; “this royal glory ({%rājya-śrī%})
…does not dwell long in one place; she had dwelt
in thousands of {%Indras%} before thee, who were very much
superior to thee;…knowing thee to be full of
vanity, she will very soon desert thee” (XII, {@224@}). {%Indra%}
saw {%Śrī%}, adorned with head-plumes, etc., issue out of {%Bali%},
who did not know whether she was an As. damsel or
a celestial one or a human one; {%Indra%} asked her who she
was, as she stood there like {%Māyā%} herself; she said:
“{%Virocana%} did not know me; {%Bali%} does not know me; the
learned called me {%Duḥsahā%}. (‘difficult to be borne’), etc. (β);
thou knowest me not, O {%Indra%}, nor does any one of the deities
know me; nor the Creator ({%Dhātā%}), nor the Ordainer
({%Vidhātā%}) rules over me; it is {%Time%} that moves me from
one place to another; do not disregard {%Bali. Bali%} has fallen off
from truth, etc.; formerly he was devoted to the {%brahmans%},
etc.; but latterly he began to cherish feelings of animosity
towards the {%brahmans%} and touched clarified butter with soiled
hands; therefore I desert him and shall henceforth dwell in
thee; there is none among D., G., As., or Rā. that can keep me
for ever.” Requested by {%Indra%}, she told him how she might
be able to reside in him permanently, dividing herself into
four parts, according to the ordinance laid down in the {%Vedas%}:
one to be established on earth, one in the waters, one in
Fire, one among the good, while {%Indra%} should continue to
protect her. {%Bali%} said that when the Sun would shine only
upon the region of {%Brahmán%} in the middle of {%Sumeru%}, then
a great battle between the gods and the {%Asuras%} would again
occur, and in that fight {%Bali%} would certainly vanquish them
all. {%Indra%} said that {%Brahmán%} had commanded him never
to kill him; “never will come the day when the Sun will
shine only from the meridian ({%madhyataḥ sthitaḥ); Brahmán%}
has before this laid down the laws that regulate the Sun's
motions…” {%Bali%} proceeded towards the South;
{%Indra%} proceeded towards the North and ascended the skies
(XII, {@225@}).—({%b%}) § 673{%b%} (Mokṣadh.): {%Bhīṣma%} said:
After the battle between the gods and the {%Asuras%}, in which
a large number of Dai. and Dā. fell, {%Bali%} became king. He
was deceived by {%Viṣṇu%}, who once more established his sway
over all the worlds. {%Indra%} was once more invested with the
sovereignty of the gods, etc.; the three worlds once more
swelled with prosperity, and {%Brahmán%} became glad of heart.
At that time {%Indra%}, accompanied by R., V., Ā., A., D.-ṛ., G.,
[Page112-a+ 62]
Si., etc., seated on the four-tusked {%Airāvata%}, made a progress
through all the worlds. Once he saw {%Bali Vairocani%} within
a certain mountain cave on the sea-shore. {%Bali%} showed no
signs of sorrow or agitation. {%Indra%} asked him how it was
that he was so unmoved; “thou art bound with {%Varuṇa's%}
noose and hast been struck with my thunderbolt.” {%Bali%}
said: “What I am now, thou wilt be in the future,”
explaining that only time (not merit) rules the destiny of
men; “that thou regardest thyself as the actor is the root
of all sorrow”; “in the course of time many thousands of
{%Indras%} and of deities have been swept away {%yuga%} after {%yuga%},
and will be swept away in future…, just as {%Pṛthu%},
etc. (α),” though they were devoted to the {%Vedas%} and {%Vedio%}
rites, etc., and though all of them were the offspring of
{%Dakṣa's%} daughters; “those 1,000 [celestial years], that are
the measure of thy sway, will surely come to an end”; “Ā.,
R., Sā., V., and M. were all vanquished by me,” etc.
{%Indra's%} panegyric on {%Bali. Indra%} left the spot and was
praised by the M.-ṛ.; {%Fire%} once more began to bear the
libations [to the gods], etc. (XII, {@227@}).
