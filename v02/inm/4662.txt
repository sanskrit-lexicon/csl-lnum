[{@Indravijaya(ḥ)@}]¦ (“the victory of Indra”). § 555:
Questioned by Yudhiṣṭhira about the misery endured by
Indra and Śacī, Śalya related: Once the Prajāpati Tvaṣṭṛ,
from antipathy to Indra, created a son who had three heads
(one for reading the Vedas; the second for drinking wine; with
the third he looked as if he were about to absorb the four
quarters), called Viśvarūpa. Beholding his austerities, Indra
became alarmed, and in vain caused Apsarases to tempt him;
then he slew him with his thunderbolt (thinking, “I shall
afterwards perform some religious ceremony”), but was yet
afraid of his appearance, and prevailed upon a carpenter to
cut off the heads (promising, “in sacrifices men will give thee
the head of the sacrificial animal as thy share”); out flew
birds—(1) partridges, (2) sparrows and hawks, (3) quails.
Then Tvaṣṭṛ created Vṛtra, who swallowed up Indra. The
gods created Jṛmbhikā (“yawning”); Vṛtra yawned (there-
fore yawn attaches itself to the living breath of animated
beings), and Indra emerged. Tvaṣṭṛ strengthened Vṛtra;
Indra returned; the gods consulted with the munis, and
sitting on Mount Mandara, they thought of Viṣṇu (V, {@9@}).
Indra, with D. and Ṛ., repaired to Viṣṇu ({%b%}), who taught
them, with Ṛ. and G., to make eternal friendship between
Indra and Vṛtra (“I may not be killed either by what is dry
or wet, stone, wood, weapons, by day or night, by Indra or
D.,” said Vṛtra). Indra then slew him in the evening with
froth blended with the thunderbolt, in which Viṣṇu had
entered. D., G., Y., Rā., M.-U., and Ṛ. glorified Indra.
But Indra was overpowered by falsehood ({%anṛta%}) and
brahmanicide ({%brahmahatyā%}), and became bereft of his
consciousness, and lay concealed in water; the earth became
treeless, the rivers were interrupted, the rains ceased (V, {@10@}).
Then Ṛ. and D. (also P. and G., ch. {@16@}) crowned Nahuṣa
as king of D., giving him their tapas: “whatever being may
stand within thy sight—D., Dā., Y., Rā., P., G., Bh.—thou
shalt absorb his power.” Nahuṣa then assumed a sensual
turn of mind, amusing himself with Aps. and devakanyāḥ
and Viśvāvasu, Nārada, G., and the six seasons, in
Nandana, and on Kailāsa, Himavat, Mandara, Śveta, Sahya,
Mahendra, Malaya, etc. He ordained that Śacī should
wait upon him. Śacī ({%c%}) repaired to Bṛhaspati, who
promised soon to unite her with Indra (V, {@11@}). Nahuṣa
became enraged; the earth, with As., G., K., M.-U., trembled;
[Page344-b+ 63]
Nahuṣa reminded of Indra's behaviour towards Ahalyā ({%d%}),
etc.; at last the gods promised to bring him Śacī; but
Bṛhaspati, as a brahman, would not abandon her, quoting
a saying of Brahmán ({%e%}); he told her to ask for time from
Nahuṣa, and so did the gods, led by Agni (V, {@12@}). Śacī
obtained the boon from Nahuṣa, and returned to Bṛhaspati.
D., with Agni, repaired to Viṣṇu, who said: “Let Indra offer
sacrifice to me; having performed the horse-sacrifice, he will
regain his dignity.” D. and Ṛ. and Bṛhaspati proceeded to
the spot where Indra was, performed a Horse-sacrifice, and
divided the {%brahmahatyā%} among trees and rivers and mountains
and earth and women; and Indra was free from fever, but
vanished again from fear of Nahuṣa. Śacī worshipped Niśā
(Night), who caused Upaśruti to appear, and Śacī prayed to
Upaśruti (V, {@13@}). Upaśruti, followed by Śacī, crossed the
heavenly groves and many mountains and came to the northern
side of Himavat, and thence to the sea; in an island there
was a large lake with an assemblage of lotuses; there they
found Indra in the fibres of a lotus-stalk, and, praising him,
Śacī implored his help against Nahuṣa (V, {@14@}). Indra said
that Nahuṣa had been strengthened by the Ṛ. with the merits
of offerings to D. and P. Śacī should tell Nahuṣa to visit
her on a vehicle borne by Ṛ. Nahuṣa consented. Śacī
prevailed upon Bṛhaspati to find out Indra, which he did by
means of a sacrifice, prevailing upon Agni to search for him.
Agni came back within the twinkling of an eye, having
searched everywhere except in the waters, which he dared not
enter (“fire rose from water, the kṣatriya caste from the
brāhmaṇa caste, and iron from stone; the power of these,
which can penetrate all other things, has no operation upon
the sources from which they sprang”) (V, {@15@}). Bṛhaspati
praised Agni ({%f%}) and strengthened him with hymns of the
Veda; Agni then found out Indra (cf. ch. {@14@}), and soon
returned and informed Bṛhaspati. This came with D.-ṛ. and
G., and praised Indra by referring to his former deeds (that
he had killed the great Asura Namuci and the Asura
Śambara and Vala and Vṛtra, as {%supra%}). Indra increased
little by little, and having assumed his original form he grew
strong, and asked what business yet remained, as he had
killed Viśvarūpa and Vṛtra. Bṛhaspati told him of Nahuṣa,
who had been strengthened by the power of the D.-ṛ., etc.
(v. ch. {@11@}), and how Nahuṣa, carried by M.-ṛ., journeyed
from world to world. Lp. Kubera and Yama Vaivasvata and
Soma and Varuṇa came and rejoiced that Viśvarūpa and Vṛtra
had been killed, and they and Agni promised him their
assistance against Nahuṣa on the condition that they and Agni
should have their shares in sacrifices, and that Kubera ({%g%}),
Yama ({%h%}), and Varuṇa ({%i%}) should this day be crowned
along with Indra (V, {@16@}). While Indra, with Lp. and D.,
was considering the means of slaying Nahuṣa, the M.-ṛ.
Agastya came and rejoiced that Viśvarūpa and Vṛtra had
been killed, and related how Nahuṣa had been hurled from
heaven (Svarga). The D.-ṛ. and B.-ṛ., weary with carrying
him, had questioned him if certain mantras ({%prokṣaṇe%}
{%gavāṃ%}) pronounced by Brahmán (so B.) were authentic
({%pramāṇaṃ%}), to which Nahuṣa, bewildered by the dark
principle ({%tamas%}), had answered in the negative; Ṛ. reproached
him, as M.-ṛ. had formerly declared them to be authentic.
Nahuṣa touched Agastya's head with his foot, and instantly
lost his power and luck ({%śrī%}), and was agitated with fear.
Then Agastya cursed him: “Fall thou from heaven, the
effect of all thy good deeds ({%puṇya%}) has been exhausted; for
10,000 years thou shalt be a snake upon earth; then thou
[Page345-a+ 63]
mayst come back to Svarga.” D., M.-ṛ., P., Y., Sp. ({%bhujagāḥ%}),
Rā., G., devakanyāḥ, and the bands of Aps., and tanks,
rivers, mountains, and the sea came and rejoiced (V, {@17@}).
Indra, glorified by G. and Aps., mounted Airāvata. Agni,
the M.-ṛ., Bṛhaspati, Yama, Varuṇa, and Kubera accompanied
him. Indra went to the three worlds with D., G., and Aps.,
and was praised by Aṅgiras (i.e. Bṛhaspati?) with hymns of
the Atharvaveda. Then he granted Atharvāṅgiras (= Aṅgiras)
the boon that his name would be connected with this Veda
and that he would get a share in sacrifices. United with
Śacī he protected the world virtuously (V, {@18@}).
