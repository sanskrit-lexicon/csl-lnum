{@Agastya@}<sup>1</sup>,¦ a ṛṣi, brother of Vasiṣṭha and son of Mitra and
Varuṇa;<sup>*</sup> he is called <is>Maitrāvaruṇi</is> (“son of Mitra and
Varuṇa”) and <is>Kumbhayoni</is> (“born in a jar”) (see below);
he once saw his ancestors hanging in a cave, and was urged
by them to procure progeny; he then from the most beautiful
parts of all animals created <is>Lopāmudrā</is> and let her become
the daughter of the king of Vidarbha; when he had married
her he, in order to procure riches for her, applied successively
to three kings, and then to the Dānava <is>Ilvala</is>, who shaped
his own younger brother into a he-goat that was digested by
Agastya. Agastya had a son by Lopāmudrā named <is>Dṛḍhasyu</is>
or <is>Idhmavāha</is>. {%A%}. prevailed upon the <is>Vindhya</is> mountain
to cease to increase in height “till he had returned from
the South,” and drunk up the Sea (and digested it), in
order that the gods might overcome the <is>Kālakeyas</is>. § 382

{%A%}. obtained the food required by lawful means. Numerous
ascetics at that time performed large sacrifices; as {%A.%}, how-
ever, was engaged in his (with seeds), Indra did not pour
rain. During the intervals of the sacrifice the Mu. spoke about
this; {%A%}. said that if Indra did not pour rain during those
twelve years he would perform the mental sacrifice, or the
touch-sacrifice, or other sacrifices; then {%A%}. by his words
caused all wealth in the three worlds, all Aps., G., Ku.,
[Page017-b+ 63]
Viśvāvasu, etc., the wealth of the Northern Kurus, Heaven,
the gods, and Dharma, to come to the place of his sacrifice;
Ṛ. praised him, but did not wish that his penances should
suffer any diminution. Indra poured rain and came with
Bṛhaspati and pacified {%A%}. After the completion of the
sacrifice, {%A%}. duly worshipped those great Mu. and dismissed
them: XIV, {@92@}δ, 2849—50, 2856—8, 2861, 2873, 2882,
