{@Śuka-Nārada-saṃvāda(ḥ)@}¦ (“conversation between Ś.
and N.”). § 715 (Mokṣadh.): XII, {@330—332@} (12422—12556)
(continued from {%Śukakṛtya%}). {%Bhīṣma%} said to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}:
{%Nārada%} then came to {%Śuka%} for the object of asking {%Śuka%} the
meaning of certain portions of the Veda. {%Nārada%} related
what {%Sanatkumāra%} had said in days of yore to certain Ṛṣis
about avoiding attachment, etc., in order to attain to final
emancipation; “with the aid of such instructions the deities
succeeded in leaving the earth and became the denizens of
heaven.” (For continuation v. {%Śukābhipatana%}.)
