[{@Cyavana-Kuśika-saṃvāda(ḥ)@}],¦ “the discourse
between {%Cyavana%} and {%Kuśika%}.” § 745{%c%} (Cyavanop.):
{%Bhīṣma%} said: {%Cyavana Bhārgava%} saw the stain that
would affect his own race and desired to consume the race
of the {%Kuśikas%}; he came and said to king {%Kuśika%} that he
desired to dwell with him for some time. {%Kuśika%} and his
wife welcomed and honoured him; according to his desire,
they promised to serve him, while he observed a vow. Once
he slept for twenty-one days, while {%Kuśika%} and the queen
kept themselves awake, foregoing all food; then {%Cyavana%} went
out, followed by the king and the queen, and disappeared
(XIII, {@52@}); the king with the queen sorrowfully returned
to the palace, where he found {%Cyavana%} stretched as before
on his bed, and sat by his side, while he slept for twenty-one
days; then {%Cyavana%} ordered them to rub him, and then
entered the bathing house, and once more disappeared by means
of his {%yoga%}-power. The next time, {%C%}. was seen on the throne;
then he ordered food (description), but reduced it all to
ashes, and disappeared. {%Kuśika%} with his queen stood there
in the same posture the whole night without speaking
a word, without giving way to wrath. So it went on every
day. {%Cyavana%} failed to notice any fault in the conduct of the
king. Then he ordered them to yoke themselves to a chariot
and pull him along; it should be the king's battle-chariot with
every weapon, etc., and the goad (description); they must
drag him slowly in the sight of the people, who lamented;
suddenly he struck them with the goad, so that they were
covered with blood; no food had passed their lips for fifty
nights; on his way he began to give away very largely of the
king's property. Then {%Cyavana%}, delighted, came down from
the chariot, unharnessed the royal couple, and granted them
a boon; he softly touched them with his hands, the healing
virtues of which were like ambrosia, and all their fatigue, etc.,
was dispelled, and they once more became endued with youth.
He dismissed them till the next day, himself remaining on the
banks of the {%Gaṅgā%}. Meanwhile {%Cyavana%}, by his {%yoga%}-power,
[Page180-a+ 59]
converted that delightful wood on the bank of the {%Gaṅgā%}
into a retreat full of wealth of every kind and jewels and gems
(XIII, {@53@}). The next morning {%Kuśika%} came with his wife,
and saw that palace made entirely of gold, etc. (description),
and Aps. and G., and thought that it was the country of the
{%Uttara-Kurus%} or {%Indra's%} abode {%Amarāvatī. Cyavana%} lay
stretched on a costly and excellent bed, and at the same time
on a mat of {%kuśa%}-grass. In a moment everything disappeared,
Aps., G., etc. {%Cyavana%} praised {%Kuśika%} and his queen; {%Kuśika%}
said that he had a sufficient boon, not having been consumed
by the fire of {%Cyavana's%} penances; he asked him to expound
some doubts (XIII, {@54@}). Asked by {%Kuśika, Cyavana%} explained
the reason of his conduct: In days past, when the gods had
assembled together, he had heard {%Brahmán%} say that, owing
to a contention between {%brahman-%} and {%kṣattriya-%}energy,
there would occur an intermixture in his race; therefore he
had resolved to exterminate the {%Kuśikas%}, but had failed to
find any fault with {%Kuśika%}; seeing the delightful palace he
had created, {%Kuśika%} had had a foretaste of heaven and had
become desirous of the status of a {%brahman%} and the merit of
penances; “the person who will be the third in descent from
thee shall attain to the status of a {%brahman%}; through the
energy of the {%Bhṛgus%}, thy grandson will be an ascetic endued
with the splendour of fire; I shall set out on a {%tīrthayātrā.”%}
{%Kuśika%} asked in what way the status of brahmanhood would
attach to his race (XIII, {@55@}). {%Cyavana%} foretold that the
{%Kṣattriyas%} would exterminate the {%Bhārgavas%}, except {%Ūrva%},
who would cast the fire of his wrath into the mare's mouth
({%Vaḍavā-vaktra%}) in the Ocean; he would have a son {%Ṛcīka%},
to whom {%Dhanurveda%} in its incarnate form would come in
order to exterminate all {%Kṣattriyas%}; he would communicate
it to his son {%Jamadagni%}:
<C n="1"/>Kuśika
<C n="1"/>Gādhi <C n="2"/>Ūrva
<C n="1"/>Viśvāmitra <C n="2"/>[Satyavatī]~Ṛcīka
<C n="1"/>Jamadagni
<C n="1"/>Rāma
{%Kuśika%} became filled with joy; {%Cyavana%} set out on his {%tīrtha-%}
{%yātrā%}; everything fell out as {%Cyavana%} had said (XIII, {@56@}).
