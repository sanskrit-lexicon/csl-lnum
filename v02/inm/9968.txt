[{@Skandotpatti(ḥ)@}]¦ (“origin of Skanda”).—§ 495 (Mārk.).
{%Mārkanḍeya%} promised to tell the story of {%Kārttikeya%}, the son
of {%Adbhuta%}, begotten of the wives of the {%Brahmarṣis%}.
Formerly, when the {%Asuras%} always defeated the gods, {%Indra%},
anxious to find out a leader for the celestial host, repaired to
the {%Mānasa%} mountain, and, hearing a woman crying for
protection, rescued her from the {%Asura Keśin%}, whom he
wounded and put to flight (III, {@223@}). She told {%Indra%} that
she was {%Devasenā%}, daughter of {%Prajāpati%}, and that her sister
{%Daityasenā%} had let herself be taken away by {%Keśin%} from the
{%Mānasa%} mountain, where they used to sport with their female
friends with the permission of {%Prajāpati. Indra%} said that she
was a sister's daughter of his mother {%Dākṣāyaṇī%}. She asked
{%Indra%} to select a husband for her, who was able to conquer
the gods, {%Dānavas, Yakṣas, Kinnaras, Uragas, Rakṣas%}, and
{%Daityas. Indra%} was grieved, thinking there was no such
husband for her.—§ 496. Then {%Indra%} perceived the Sun
rising from the {%Udaya%} hill, and {%Soma%} (the Moon) entering the
Sun on the {%amāvasyā%} (new-moon day) at the {%Raudra muhūrta%},
and the gods and {%Asuras%} fighting on the {%Udaya%} mountain,
the morning twilight tinged with red clouds, the Sea blood-
red; {%Bhṛgus%} and {%Aṅgirases%} offered oblations, and {%Agni%} took
the oblations and entered the Sun, whilst the Sun was
entering the twenty-fourth {%parvan%}, and {%Sindhu%} was flowing
with a current of fresh blood, etc. {%Indra%} thought that, if
now {%Soma%} or {%Agni%} gave birth to a son, this son might become
the husband of {%Devasenā%}. Then he repaired with {%Devasenā%}
to the world of {%Brahmán%}, who promised that it should be as
{%Indra%} had thought. Then {%Indra%}. with {%Devasenā%}, repaired to
the place where the {%devarṣis Vasiṣṭha%}, etc. lived, and the
gods also came thither to drink {%soma%} and receive their shares
of offerings, and the {%Adbhuta%} fire came from the solar disc to
the {%āhavanīya%} and made over the offerings to the gods. He,
(Adbhuta), then saw the wives of the {%ṛṣis%} sleeping in their
{%āśramas%} and fell in love. In order to look at them daily, he
entered the {%gārhapatya%} fire, and dwelt there for a long time,
and at last, from despair, repaired to a forest in order to do
away with himself. {%Svāhā%}, daughter of {%Dakṣa%}, who had in
vain loved {%Adbhuta%}, now resolved upon assuming the guise of
the wives of the seven {%ṛṣis%} (III, {@224@}). {%Svāhā%} first gratified
[Page644-b+ 63]
her desire in the guise of {%Śivā%}, the wife of {%Aṅgiras%}, and then,
lest somebody should unduly suspect the brāhmaṇa ladies,
she went out of the forest in the guise of a bird ({%garuḍī%},
{%suparṇī%}), and on the {%Śveta%} mountain, that was covered with
clumps of reeds and guarded with seven-headed poisonous
serpents, {%rākṣasas, Piśācas%}, etc., she threw the semen, which
she held in her hand, into a golden basin. Then, assuming
successively the form of five of the others, she did the same
on the first lunar day ({%pratipadi%}). Only the form of
{%Arundhatī%} she was unable to assume because of her ascetic
merit and devotion to her husband. The semen produced a
child, whom the {%ṛṣis%} called {%Skanda%} (etymology v. 14315),
with six heads, etc. On the second day it first assumed a
form, on the 3rd it looked like a little child, on the fourth
the limbs were developed. Seizing the bow used by the
destroyer of {%Tripura, Skanda%} uttered a terrible roar, so that
the great {%nāgas Citra%} and {%Airāvata%} sprang up. But {%Skanda%}
seized them with two of his hands, and holding a dart in one
hand, a cock in another, etc., and blowing a conch-shell, he
terrified the creatures with his roars. The persons of various
orders, who then sought the protection of {%Skanda%}, are called
his followers by the brahmans ({%pāriṣadān brāhmaṇān%}, read
{%brāhmaṇāḥ%}). Discharging his arrows in the direction of the
{%Śveta%} mountain, he rent asunder the mountain {%Krauñca%}, the
son of {%Himavat%}; therefore the swans and vultures go to
the mountain {%Meru%}. The other mountains also screamed
aloud. Then, with his lance, he rent in twain one of the
peaks of the {%Śveta%} mountain. Mount {%Śveta%} and the other
mountains left the Earth and fled: the Earth was torn
asunder on all sides; she went to {%Skanda%} and regained her
power; the mountains bowed down to {%Skanda%} and came back
to the Earth, and all creatures worshipped {%Skanda%} on the
fifth day of the lunar month (III, {@225@}).—§ 497. Terrific
prodigies were seen everywhere. The {%ṛṣis%} tried to restore
tranquillity to the universe. The inhabitants of the {%Caitra-%}
{%ratha%} forest accused the wives of the six {%ṛṣis%}, other ones the
fowl ({%garuḍī%}) of being the cause thereof; but nobody suspected
{%Svāhā%}. The seven {%ṛṣis%} divorced their wives with the
exception of {%Arundhatī%}, though {%Svāhā%} claimed the child as
hers. {%Viśvāmitra%}, having concluded the sacrifice of the
seven {%ṛṣis%}, had secretly followed the god of fire, and knew
everything as it had happened. He sought the protection of
{%Skanda%}, and performed for him the thirteen auspicious rites
of childhood ({%maṅgalāni kaumārāṇi%}): the {%jālakarman%}, etc., etc.
Though {%Viśvāmitra%} informed the seven {%ṛṣis%} of the innocence
of their wives, yet they abandoned them unconditionally.—
§ 498. The gods asked {%Indra%} to kill {%Skanda%}, but he dared
not attack him, saying that {%Skanda%} was able to destroy even
the Creator of the world. Then they let the Mothers of the
world approach in order to kill {%Skanda%}, but they adopted him
as their son and let him suck their breasts, especially the
daughter of {%Krodha%} with a spike in her hand, and the
daughter of the Red Sea, who lived on blood; and his father
{%Agni%} came and, transformed into {%Naigameya%} (see BR.) with
a goat's month, gratified him with toys (III, {@226@}).
