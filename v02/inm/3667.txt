{@[Draupadī-Satyabhāmā-saṃvādaparvan]@}¦ (“con-
versation between Draupadī and Satyabhāmā,” the 42nd
of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.). § 510: After the
{%brahmans%} and {%Pāṇḍavas%} had taken their seats, {%Draupadī%} and
{%Satyabhāmā Sātrājitī%}, the favourite wife of {%Kṛṣṇa%}, entered
the hermitage. {%Satyabhāmā%} asked {%Draupadī%} how she made
the {%Pāṇḍavas%} obedient to her, in order that she herself
might by the same means secure the affection of {%Kṛṣṇa%}.
[Page262-b+ 63]
{%Draupadī%} warned her against using drugs, incantations, etc.,
which were used by wicked women, and said that she
kept aloof from vanity and served the {%Pāṇḍavas%} with
devotion, etc. Formerly, in the palace of {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} at
{%Indraprastha%}, food was daily given to 8,000 {%brahmans%},
80,000 {%snātakas%} with thirty serving-maids assigned to each,
10,000 {%yatis%}; he had 100,000 well-dressed serving-maids
with bracelets, etc., all skilled in singing and dancing;
100,000 maidservants who day and night used to feed
guests; 100,000 horses, and 100,000 elephants. And it
was {%Draupadī%} who had the supervision of all this; she knew
the names and features of all the girls, and knew everything
about them, and even about the cowherds and shepherds. She
alone knew the income and expenditure of the king and what
their whole wealth was, bearing hunger and thirst, and
being the first to wake up and the last to go to bed (III,
{@233@}). {%Draupadī%} said that for women there is no god equal
to the husband, as it is from him the wife obtains offspring,
articles of enjoyment, fame, and heaven itself hereafter. In
order to attract the heart of {%Kṛṣṇa, Satyabhāmā%} ought to
let him understand that she adored him with all her heart
by promptly, when she saw him enter her chamber, offering
him a seat and water to wash his feet; and even if he ordered
a maidservant to do anything, she ought to get up and do it
herself; not to blab of whatever he should speak before her;
feed those that were dear to him, and keep herself aloof from
those that were hostile to him; not to stay or converse in
private even with her sons {%Pradyumna%} and {%Śāmba%}; and
shun wicked women (III, {@234@}).—§ 511: Then {%Kṛṣṇa%}
bade farewell to the {%Pāṇḍavas%} and to {%Mārkaṇḍeya%}, etc., and
called for {%Satyabhāmā. Satyabhāmā%} comforted {%Draupadī%},
saying that she would soon recover her ancient happiness,
and relating of {%Prativindhya, Śrutasoma%}, and {%Śrutakarman%}
(her son by {%Arjuna%}), and {%Śatānīka%} (her son by {%Nakula%}), and
{%Śrutasena%} (her son by {%Sahadeva%}), that they were well and
skilled in weapons and, like {%Abhimanyu%}, delighted with
staying at {%Dvāravatī%}, and were loved by {%Subhadrā, Pradyumna%},
{%Kṛṣṇa%}, with his son {%Bhānu%}, etc., and her mother-in-law,
and all the {%Andhakas%} and {%Vṛṣṇis%}, with {%Rāma%}, etc. Then
{%Satyabhāmā%} mounted the chariot of {%Kṛṣṇa%} and they set out
for his city (III, {@235@}).
