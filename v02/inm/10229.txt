[{@Sukanyopākhyāna(ṃ)@}]¦ (“the episode relating to
Sukanyā”). § 405 (Tīrthay.). {%Lomaśa%} related: When
{%Cyavana%}, the son of the {%maharṣi Bhṛgu%} practised austerities
by the side of this lake, and, assuming the posture {%vīrasthāna%},
had been enveloped by an anthill, king {%Śaryāti%} came to the
lake with his 4,000 wives and his only daughter {%Sukanyā%}.
The {%viprarṣi Cyavana%}, seeing {%Sukanyā%}, was gladdened and
spoke to her, but she did not hear him. Then {%Sukanyā%},
seeing his eyes in the anthill, pierced them with thorns from
curiosity. He, becoming very angry, obstructed the excre-
ments and urine of {%Śaryāti's%} soldiers, and {%Śaryāti%} at last
discovered the cause of their distress, and only obtained
deliverance therefrom by bestowing {%Sukanyā%} upon {%Cyavana%}.
Then {%Śaryāti%}, with his troops, went to his city, and {%Sukanyā%}
remained with {%Cyavana%} (III, {@122@}). Once, when the {%Aśvins%}
had seen {%Sukanyā%}, after she had bathed, they asked her to
choose one of them for her husband, and as she refused, they
entered the water together with {%Cyavana%}, and when they all
came out of the tank young and beautiful they asked her
to choose one of them and she choose {%Cyavana. Cyavana%}
[Page656-b+ 63]
promised them to make them drinkers of {%soma%} in the presence
of {%Indra%}. Then the {%Aśvins%}, highly delighted, ascended to
heaven (III, {@123@}). When {%Śaryāti%} heard that {%Cyavana%} had
been turned into a youth, he came with his wife and troops
to see him, and became very glad. {%Cyavana%} caused him to
perform a sacrifice with {%Cyavana%} as his priest. When
{%Cyavana%} was about to take up {%soma%} in order to offer it to the
{%Aśvins, Indra%} forbade it, saying, that they were physicians
and servants, assumed forms at pleasure, and roamed about
in the world of mortals, and as {%Cyavana%} did not obey he
prepared to hurl his thunderbolt at him, but {%Cyavana%} paralysed
his arm and fulfilled his intention. Then he created a {%kṛtyā%},
a great {%Asura%} named {%Mada%} (description); this rushed forth
to devour {%Indra%} (III, {@124@}), who only was delivered when
he had sanctioned that the {%Aśvins%} should henceforth be
entitled to the {%soma%} juice, saying that he had only intended
to spread the fame of {%Cyavana%} and {%Śaryāti. Cyavana%} dis-
tributed {%Mada%} (who had been created repeatedly before) in
drinks, women, gambling, and hunting.
