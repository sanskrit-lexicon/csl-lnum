[{@Arghāharaṇaparvan@}]¦ (“on the handing over of the
gift of honour,” the 26th of the minor parvans of Mhbhr.).
§ 289: On the {%abhiṣecanīya%} day {%maharṣis%} and {%Nārāda%}
entered the {%antarvedi%} and sat down together with the {%rājarṣis%}
engaged in various topics of conversation and dispute. No
{%śūdra%} was then near the {%antarvedi%}, nor anybody without vows
[Page067-b+ 63]
({%avratin). Nārada%} sat there with feelings of awe, remembering
the words he had heard of old in the mansion of Brahmán
regarding the incarnation of the deities, and knowing
that {%Kṛṣṇa%} was the incarnation of {%Nārāyaṇa%} and would
himself destroy all these assembled {%kṣattriyas. Bhīṣma%}
then proposed to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} that {%arghas%} should be offered
to the kings, and first to him who was the foremost. As
{%Bhīṣma%} declared {%Kṛṣṇa%} to be foremost, he caused {%Sahadeva%}
to present the first {%argha%} to {%Kṛṣṇa%}, which filled the {%Cedi%}
king {%Śiśupāla%} with envy (II, {@36@}). {%Śiśupāla%} gravely
censures {%Bhīṣma, Yudhiṣṭhira%}, and {%Kṛṣṇa%} (saying that
he was a servant and cowherd and no king, and speaking
depreciatingly of his exploits), and accompanied by the
kings left the assembly (II, {@37@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} ran after
{%Śiśupāla%} and spoke sweetly to him in order to conciliate
him; {%Bhīṣma%} maintained the fitness of giving {%Kṛṣṇa%} the
first {%argha%} (II, {@38@}). {%Sāhadeva%} and {%Nārada%} declared it to
be highly improper not to worship {%Kṛṣṇa. Sunītha%}
(i.e. {%Śiśupāla%}) stirred the kings up in order to obstruct the
completion of the sacrifice (II, {@39@}).
