{@Sītāharaṇa(ṃ)@}¦ (“the carrying away of Sītā”). § 529
(cf. Rāmopākhyānap.). {%Rāvaṇa%} caused {%Mārīca%} to entice away
{%Rāma%} by assuming the shape of a deer with golden horns and
a golden skin. Seeing this deer {%Rāma%} pursued it, like {%Rudra%}
pursuing the stellar deer ({%tārāmṛgaṃ%}) in days of yore; struck
with {%Rāma's%} arrow {%Mārīca%}, imitating {%Rāma's%} voice cried out,
calling upon {%Sītā%} and {%Lakṣmaṇa. Lakṣmaṇa%}, thinking that
nobody was able to slay {%Rāma%}, at first inclined to stay there
and protect {%Sītā%}, but as she suspected him, he set out on the
track of {%Rāma%}. Then {%Rāvaṇa%}, in the guise of an ascetic, with
shaven head and with a {%kuṇḍala%} and a triple staff, came to the
hermitage and began to carry away {%Sītā%} to {%Laṅkā%}; on his
way he was seen by the vulture {%Jaṭāyu%} (III, {@278@}).
