[{@Sañjayayānaparvan(°va)@}]¦ (“the section relating to
the mission of Sañjaya,” the 58th of the minor parvans
of Mhbhr.; cf. Sañjayayāna). § 556: {%Drupada's purohita%}
was honoured by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Bhīṣma%}, and {%Vidura%}. He
mentioned the eternal duties of kings; the {%Pāṇḍavas%} had not
obtained their share of the paternal wealth; the murderous
contrivances of the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%}; the deceitful game; the
indignities in the council-hall; the exile for thirteen years;
the {%Pāṇḍavas%} desired nothing but a peaceful settlement; the
{%Pāṇḍavas%} were more powerful; men like {%Sātyaki, Bhīmasena%},
[Page618-a+ 63]
and the twins were equal in might to 1,000 {%akṣauhiṇīs%};
{%Arjuna%} and {%Kṛṣṇa%} nobody could fight (V, {@20@}). {%Bhīṣma%}
approved of his speech; but {%Karṇa%} wrathfully interrupted
him. {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} pacified {%Bhīṣma%}, rebuked {%Karṇa%}, sent
{%Drupada's purohita%} back to the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, and summoned
{%Sañjaya%} to the council-hall (V, {@21@}). {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} gave
instructions to {%Sañjaya%}, praising the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (α) and {%Kṛṣṇa%}
and some of their adherents (β), mentioning the killing of
{%Śiśupāla (b%}), blaming {%Duryodhana%}, and {%Karṇa%}, and ordered
him to go to {%Upaplavya%} to salute them and the five sons
of {%Draupadī%}, and tell them that {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} was desirous
of peace with the {%Pāṇḍavas%} (V, {@22@}). {%Sañjaya%} came to
{%Upaplavya%} and saluted {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} and enquired about
{%Bhīmasena%}, etc. (γ). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} inquired about {%Dhṛta-%}
{%rāṣṭra%}, etc. (δ), and mentioned the prowess of {%Arjuna (c%}),
{%Sahadeva (d), Nakula (e%}), and the {%Ghoṣayātrā%} (V, {@23@}).
{%Sañjaya%} delivered his message and answered {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%}
questions (V, {@24@}). In the presence of the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, etc. (ε),
{%Sañjaya%} greeted {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (ζ), and recommended
peace, “for what, in sooth, is life after having killed all your
kinsfolk?”; he mentioned {%Kṛṣṇa%}, etc. (η) on the side of
the {%Pāṇḍavas%}, and {%Droṇa%}, etc. (θ), on the side of the
{%Kauravas%} (V, {@25@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} said that peace was
preferable to war, but complained that {%Duryodhana%} had
disregarded the words of {%Vidura%}, and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} had been
desirous solely of satisfying his sons; that {%Duryodhana's%}
counsellors were now {%Duḥśāsana, Śakuni%}, and {%Karṇa%}. He
compared {%Arjuna, Bhīma, Nakula%}, and {%Sahadeva%} with {%Karṇa%}
and {%Duryodhana%}. He claimed {%Indraprastha%} for his kingdom
(V, {@26@}). {%Sañjaya%} declared that if, without war, the {%Kurus%}
would not yield his share to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, then it would
be far better for him to live upon alms in the kingdom of
the {%Andhakas%} and the {%Vṛṣṇis%} than to obtain sovereignty by
war (V, {@27@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} said that virtue and vice, which
are both eternal and absolute, exchange their aspects during
seasons of distress; he would not seek even what belongs to
{%Prajāpati%}, or heaven, or {%Brahmaloka (Prājāpatyaṃ tridivaṃ%}
{%Brahmalokaṃ%}) by unrighteous means; but he would be
guided by {%Kṛṣṇa%}, as did {%Sātyaki%}, etc. (ι); {%Kṛṣṇa%} was the
great judge of the propriety or otherwise of all acts (V, {@28@}).
{%Kṛṣṇa%} said he wished prosperity for both the {%Pāṇḍavas%}
and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%}; therefore he desired peace; but when
{%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} and his sons were so covetous, war was
inevitable; “some say that work should be shunned and
that salvation is attainable by knowledge; but the brahmans
know this, that though one may have a knowledge of eatable
things, yet the hunger will not be appeased unless one actually
eats; such branches of knowledge as are of use in doing
works bear fruit, but not the other ones. In the other world
it is by virtue of work that the gods, etc. (κ) flourish.
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} is constantly engaged in the study of the {%Veda%};
he is bent on the horse-sacrifice and the {%rājasūya%}; he
rides horses and elephants, etc.; if the {%Pāṇḍavas%} could see
a course of action not involving the slaughter of the sons of
{%Kuru%}, they would adopt it. But we must take into con-
sideration the division into four castes and the respective
duties allotted to each (specification). War and weapons
were invented by {%Indra%} for putting the {%Dasyus%} to death.”
{%Kṛṣṇa%} alluded to the game and the role of {%Śakuni%} there,
to the indignities undergone by {%Kṛṣṇā%} from {%Duḥśāsana%} and
{%Karṇa%}, while the {%Kurus%} with {%Bhīṣma%} at their head did not
interfere, and only {%Vidura%} took her part; and that {%Duḥśāsana%}
had called the {%Pāṇḍaras%} eunuchs at their departure. He
[Page618-b+ 63]
would go in person to the {%Kurus%}. He compared the evil
passions of {%Duryodhana%}, etc. (λ), with the righteousness of
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (μ). “King {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} with his sons
constitute a forest, while the {%Pāṇḍavas%} are its tigers; do not
cut down the forest with its tigers, and let not the tigers be
driven away from the forest; the tiger out of the wood
is easily slain; the wood also that is without a tiger is easily
cut down.” Similarly the {%Dhārtarāṣṭras%} are as creepers,
the {%Pāṇḍavas%} are {%Śāla-%} trees, and the creepers cannot dis-
pense with a large tree round which it can twine (V, {@29@}).
{%Sañjaya%} then bade farewell to {%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, etc. (ν).
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} spoke approvingly of {%Sañjaya's%} agreeable
speech and excellent conduct as an ambassador, and com-
pared him to {%Vidura%}, and declared him to be as dear to them
as {%Dhanañjaya%} (i.e. Arjuna). He recommended the {%brahmans%}
to him, and told him to salute {%Droṇa%}, etc. (ξ), and the
aged, middle-aged, and young ladies, “the daughters of our
house,” and the maidservants and manservants, and the
many humpbacked and lame ones among them, and those
that were defective in limb, or imbecile, and the dwarfs
to whom {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} gave food and raiment from motives
of humanity, the blind, the aged, the many that had the use
only of their hands, being destitute of legs, the masterless
and weak, those that vainly strived to earn a living, the
ignorant, in fact, all those that were in pitiable circum-
stances, all the ambassadors arrived from all sides, etc. He
concluded with this message to {%Duryodhana%}: “give me back
my own {%Indraprastha (Śakrapurīṃ%}), or fight with me”
(V, {@30@}). {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} said that the Creator ({%Dhātṛ%}) gives
and takes according to his will. He told {%Sañjaya%} especially
to salute {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Bhīṣma%}, and {%Vidura%}, and recommend
the {%Pāṇḍavas%} to them, that they might counsel peace; and
to say to {%Duryodhana%} that the {%Pāṇḍavas%} were willing to forgive
his insults to {%Draupadī (Kṛṣṇā%}) and {%Duḥśāsana's%} dragging
her, disregarding {%Kuntī%}; but they must have their proper
share of the kingdom; “give us even a single province of the
empire; give us even {%Kuśasthala%} (B. {%Avi°%}), {%Vṛkasthala, Mākandī%},
{%Vāraṇāvata%}, and in the fifth place any other village that
thou likest; even this will end the quarrel.” He said that
to see the {%Kurus%} and the {%Pāñśālas%} live happily united was
what he desired (V, {@31@}). Having returned to {%Hāstinapura%},
{%Sañjaya%} addressed {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} at night; he praised
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%}, “who shines in his natural perfection, leaving
his load of sins to be borne by thee,” while {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra's%}
acts were contrary to both religion and profit. In delivering
the message from {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} he did not mention the
alternative of giving them the five villages. He alluded to
{%Arjuna's%} ascending to the very heavens and being honoured
there. King {%Bali%}, not finding a primary cause ({%pāraṃ%}),
regarded time ({%kālaḥ%}) to be the cause of everything.
“To-morrow morning the {%Kurus%}, assembled together in the
council-hall, will hear the words of {%Ajātaśatru%} (i.e. {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%})” (V, {@32@}).
