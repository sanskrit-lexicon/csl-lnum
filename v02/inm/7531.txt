{@Nakulākhyāna@}¦ (“the narrative of the mungoose”). § 11
(Parvasaṅgr.): I, {@2@}, 609.—§ 786{%b%} (Anugītāparvan): At the
conclusion of {%Yudhiṣṭhira's%} horse-sacrifice, after everybody
had been gratified, a blue-eyed mungoose, with one side of its
body changed into gold, came and said, in voice as loud and
deep as thunder, that this great sacrifice was not equal to
a {%prastha%} of powdered barley given away by a liberal
brahman of {%Kurukṣetra%}, who was observing the {%uñcha-%} (or
the pigeon-) vow. Asked by the brahmans the mungoose
related: The brahman named lived with his wife, son, and
daughter-in-law, and practised penances; he used to eat
every day at the sixth division; during a famine he had
nothing to eat day after day; one day in the month of
{%Jyaiṣṭha%}, while the sun was in the meridian, he was picking
up grains of corn, but got nothing; one day, after the sixth
division had come, he obtained a {%prastha%} of barley, which they
reduced to powder for making {%saktu%}; having finished their
recitations and libations, etc., they divided the powdered
barley among themselves, so that each got a {%kuḍava%}; then
came a guest, who ate all the portions, the wife, son, and
daughter-in-law with difficulty prevailing upon the brahman
to give their portions as well. The guest turned out to be
{%Dharma%}; flowers were rained down from heaven; D.-ṛ, D., G.,
{%Devadūtas%}, etc., and B.-ṛ. standing in {%vimānas%} and dwelling in
{%Brahmaloka%} were struck with wonder; “I have been rescued,
and others who have not yet come ({%anāgatāḥ%}) have been
rescued for countless {%yugas%}; he that gives away 100 having
1,000, 10 having 100, and a handful of water having no
wealth, are equal in merit,” citing {%Rantideva (c), Nṛga (d%}), and
{%Śibi Auśīnara%}; “thou hast conquered {%Brahmaloka%}.” The
brahman, with his wife, son, and daughter-in-law, proceeded
to heaven on a celestial chariot. The mungoose continued:
“I came out of my hole, and by the contact with the powder
of barley, etc., my head and half of my body became gold;
in order to convert the rest of my body into gold I repeatedly
repair to the hermitages of ascetics and to the sacrifices of
kings; I came hither with high hopes, but I have not been made
into gold.” Then the mungoose disappeared (XIV, {@90@}).—
That mungoose was {%Dharma%}, who having injured {%Jama-%}
{%dagni (f%}) had been cursed by the {%Pitṛs%}, but became freed
from the curse by disparaging himself in the form of
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} (XIV, {@92@}).
