{@Jaratkāru@}<sup>1</sup>,¦ a ṛṣi, husband of Jaratkāru and father of
Āstīka. § 26 (cf. Āstīkap.): Sauti said: The ascetic {%J.%},
when going about and practising religious austerities, one day
saw his ancestors, the Yāyāvaras, hanging, heads down, in
a great hole by a rope of {%vīraṇa%} fibres, which was eaten into
on all sides by a rat; he was told that it was because he had
no offspring. He then promised to marry, if he might get
a wife of the same name as his own, and who would be given
to him in charity (I, {@13@}). At last he married Jaratkāru,
the sister of Vāsuki, the king of serpents (I, {@14@}), who
intended by this marriage to neutralize the curse inflicted on
the serpents by their mother (Kadrū, q.v.). Having begotten
Āstīka, {%J%}. ascended to heaven together with his ancestors
(I, {@15@}): I, {@13@}, 1029 ({%Yāyāvarāṇāṃ pravaraḥ%}), 1034, 1037,

—§ 49 (Vāsuki): I, {@38@}, 1633, 1634, 1635 (it had been
destined by Brahmán that {%J%}. should marry Vāsuki's sister
Jaratkāru and beget Āstīka on her); {@39@}, 1650, 1653, 1654.

The story of {%J%}. repeated (cf. § 26) and somewhat enlarged:

1846, (1847), 1848, (1850), 1864; {@47@}, 1869 ({%ṛṣiṃ%}), 1872,

[Page356-a+ 63]
his wife when the sun was setting, was awakened by her, lest
the twilight should pass away without his prayers being said.
{%J%}. felt insulted, as he believed that the sun had no power to
set in the usual time if he was asleep. He therefore left her
and again began to practise austerities: I, {@47@}, 1882, 1891,
