or desire, according to inclination; agreeably to
desire; at will; willingly, joyfully; (as a particle of
assent) well, very well; granted; admitted that;

{%Kāmam — na%} or {%kāmam — na tu,%} rather — than

{%yacchet tu guṇa-hīnāya,%} ‘rather should a girl stay
at home till her death, than that he should give her
to one void of excellent qualities’); in this sense the

cede or its place may occasionally be taken by an
interrogative sentence (e. g. {%kāmaṃ nayatu māṃ%}
{%devaḥ kim ardhena ātmano hi me,%} ‘rather let the
god take me, what is the use to me of half my
existence?’). {%Kāmam — tu,%} or {%kāmam — kiṃ tu,%}

thee I shall go — this child however thou must not
forsake;’ or the disjunctive particles are left out alto-
gether). {%—Kāmaṅ-gāmin, ī, inī, i,%} going at will;

one's own accord.
