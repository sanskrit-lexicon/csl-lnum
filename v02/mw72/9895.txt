{#itTA#}¦ {%itthā,%} ind., Ved. thus; (often used
in the Ṛg-veda, and sometimes only to lay stress on
a following word; therefore by native etymologists
[Page0139-b+ 77]
considered as a particle of affirmation.) {%Itthā%} is
often connected with words expressing devotion to
the gods &c. in the sense of thus, truly, really;
especially with {%dhī%} as an adjective. Hence {%itthā-%}
{%dhī%} = such, i. e. true ({%satyā%}) or real worship. Simi-
larly, {%itthā-dhī, īs, īs, i,%} so devout, so pious, i. e.
very devout; (Sāy.) performing such or true works.
