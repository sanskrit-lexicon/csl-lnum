{#prAdus#}¦ {%prādus,%} ind. (perhaps fr. {%prā%} for
1. {%pra%} + 1. {%dur,%} i. e. before or outside the door, in
open daylight; said to be fr. rt. {%ad%} with {%pra;%} accord-
ing to Pāṇ. VIII. 3, 41, the final {%s%} is changed into {%ṣ%}
before {%k%} and {%p;%} and according to Pāṇ. VIII. 3, 87, the
radical {%s%} of rt. 1. {%as,%} ‘to be,’ is changed to {%ṣ%} after
{%prādus%} whenever in the conjugation of this rt. the
initial {%a%} is dropped, e. g. {%prāduḥ ṣanti,%} not {%prā-%}
{%duḥ santi; prādus%} appears to occur only in con-
nection with the rts. 1. {%as,%} 1. {%bhū,%} and 1. {%kṛ,%} except
in the comp. {%prāduṣ-pītam%} given as an example
by the Scholiast on Pāṇ. VIII. 3, 41); apparently,
evidently, manifestly, visibly, in sight. According
to native lexicographers the senses in which {%prādus%}
is used may be expressed by the following Sanskrit
words, {%prākāśya, nāman, sam-bhāvya, sam-bhava,%}
{%pra-vṛtti, vṛtti.%}
