{#nanu#}¦ {%na-nu,%} ind. (fr. 2. {%na + nu%}), a strong
negative particle = ‘not at all’ (Ved.); a particle of
interrogation = the Latin {%nonne,%} ‘not?’ ‘is not?’
‘are not?’ ‘does he not?’ often a particle of affir-
mation = ‘is it not so?’ i. e. ‘it certainly must be
so,’ hence = ‘certainly,’ ‘assuredly,’ or with an impe-
rative = ‘pray,’ ‘do,’ ‘just,’ ‘well,’ ‘do now,’ &c., or
sometimes with an interrogative pronoun (e. g. {%nanu%}
{%ko bhavān,%} pray who art thou?); in argumentative
writings often a mere inceptive particle = ‘now then,’
‘but then,’ ‘but’ (e. g. {%nanu na kiñcin mānam%}
{%iti cen na,%} now if it be said that there is no proof,
not so); {%nanv astu tathāpi,%} ‘well, be it so, never-
theless;’ {%nanu ca,%} ‘and (is it) not so?’ ‘is not then?’
‘there can be no doubt.’ According to native lexi-
cographers {%nanu%} is also a vocative particle = ‘ho,’
‘hallo;’ a particle implying kindness, conciliation, &c.,
= ‘pray,’ ‘good friend;’ a responsive particle; a parti-
cle of reproach, perplexity, &c.
