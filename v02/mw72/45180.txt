‘a worshipper or follower of Viṣṇu,’ N. of one of
the three great divisions of modern Hindū sects,
(the other two being the Śaivas and Śāktas; the
Vaiṣṇavas believe in the supremacy of Viṣṇu over
the other gods of the Tri-mūrti; they are divided
into six principal sects, as follow, 1. the Rāmānujas
or Śrī-sampradāyins, founded by the celebrated re-
former Rāmānuja, who flourished in the south of
India towards the latter part of the twelfth century;
the most striking peculiarity of this sect, who are
chiefly found in the south, is the scrupulous preparation
and privacy of their meals; they are distinguished by
two perpendicular white lines drawn from the root
of the hair to the commencement of each eyebrow,
and a connecting transverse streak across the root of
the nose; their chief authoritative works are the
Vedānta-sūtras and other Vedānta works, the Pañca-
rātra of Nārada, the Viṣṇu-Purāṇa and other Pu-
rāṇas: 2. the Rāmānandas, a sect founded by Rāmā-
nanda, disciple of Rāmānuja, and very numerous in
Gangetic India; they worship Viṣṇu under the form
of Rāma-candra and his consort Sītā; their favourite
work is the Bhakta-mālā: 3. the followers of Kabīr,
a celebrated disciple of Rāmānanda, principally found
in upper and central India; they do not observe all the
ceremonies of the Hindūs, but conform to the usages
of caste, and pay a sort of respect to Viṣṇu: 4. the
Vallabhācāryas or Rudra-sampradāyins, see {%valla-%}
{%bhācārya;%} this sect draws its doctrines from the
Bhāgavata-Purāṇa and works of Vallabha: 5. the
Mādhvas or Brahma-sampradāyins, founded by Ma-
dhvācārya, who is regarded by his followers as an
incarnation of Vāyu, the god of wind; they are
found especially in the south of India, and appear to
combine with their worship of Viṣṇu a friendly
leaning towards the god Śiva: 6. the Vaiṣṇavas of
Bengal, a sect founded by Caitanya, who is regarded
as an incarnation of Kṛṣṇa; their chief ritual con-
sists in constantly repeating the name of Kṛṣṇa);
scil. {%yajña,%} a particular sacrificial ceremony; epithet
