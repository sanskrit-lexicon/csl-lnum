{%Muṇḍaka, as,%}¦ m. the lopped trunk or stem of a
tree, a tree stripped of its branches; a shaver, barber;
({%ikā%}), f. a species of plant; ({%am%}), n. the head; N.
of the chapters into which the Muṇḍakopaniṣad is
divided. {%—Muṇḍakopaniṣad (°ka-up°),%} f., N. of
a well-known Upaniṣad of the Atharva-veda (con-
taining three short chapters or Muṇḍakas, each of
which comprises two sections or Khaṇḍas, and said
to take its name from the word {%muṇḍa%} because
every one who comprehends its secret doctrine is
‘shorn,’ i. e. liberated from all error, a similar idea
being probably involved in the name of the Kṣuri-
kopanishad or ‘Razor Upaniṣad:’ the Muṇḍaka
is one of the most interesting of the numerous Upa-
niṣads, on account of the reasons which it gives
for the superiority of these works over the Veda and
its ritual; thus, according to Muṇḍaka I. 4, there
are two sciences, the higher and the inferior; the
inferior is the knowledge of the Ṛg-veda, Yajur-
veda, Sāma-veda, Atharva-veda, pronunciation, ritual,
grammar, explanation of Vedic texts, prosody, and
the astronomical calendar; but the higher knowledge
is that by which the imperishable Brahma is com-

prehended). {%—Muṇḍakopaniṣad-dīpikā,%} f., N. of
a commentary on the above.
