{%Śākha, as,%}¦ m. (said to be fr. rt. {%śākh,%} but accord-
ing to others fr. rt. 1. {%śak%}), a particular plant ({%= chitti%});
N. of Kumāra or Kārttikeya; of a son of Kumāra;
of a place; ({%ā%}), f. the branch of a tree &c., a branch
(in general); any part or division of an animal; an
arm; a finger (Ved., the fingers being compared to
branches); a sect, faction, party; a subdivision, sec-
tion (of any work); a branch or school or traditional
recension of the Vedas, (i. e. the Saṃhitā or collection
of Mantras and the Brāhmaṇas in each Veda as re-
ceived in conflicting schools, modified more or less
both in variations of the actual text and in difference
of arrangement, and even of interpretation; the
work {%śākhā%} or branch is sometimes used to dis-
tinguish the three original Vedas from each other,
as when it is said that ‘Sāma hymns ought not to
be recited in the neighbourhood of another Śākhā,’
i. e. of the other two Vedas; but it properly
applies to the various recensions or editions of any
of the original Vedas handed down by different
Caraṇas, i. e. by different schools or sects, each ad-
hering to its own traditional text and interpretation:
in the Caraṇa-vyūha, a work by Śaunaka treating of
these various schools, five Śākhās are enumerated of
the Ṛg-veda, viz. those of the Śākalas, Bāṣkalas,
Āśvalāyanas, Śānkhāyanas, and Māṇḍukāyanas; forty-
two or forty-four out of eighty-six are mentioned of
the Yajur-veda, fifteen of which belong to the Vāja-
saneyins, including those of the Kāṇvas and Mādh-
yandinas; twelve out of a thousand said to have once
existed of the Sāma-veda and nine of the Atharva-
veda; of all these, however, the Ṛg-veda is said to
be now extant in one only, viz. the Śākala-śākhā,
the Yajur-veda in three and partially in four, the
Sāma-veda in one or perhaps two, and the Atharva-
veda in one: although the words {%caraṇa%} and {%śākhā%}
are sometimes used synonymously, yet {%caraṇa%} pro-
perly applies to the sect or collection of persons united
in one school, and {%śākhā%} to the traditional text
followed, as in the phrase {%śākhām adhīte,%} he reads
a particular recension of the Veda); any part of an
animal devoid of sensibility (as a horn &c.); {%= an-%}
