once worshipped as a kind of goddess resembling
Pomona; in Ṛg-veda IV. 57, 6, Sītā is invoked as
a deity presiding over agriculture or the fruits of the
earth, and appears to be associated with Indra, whence

addressed, four furrows being required to be drawn
at the ceremony when these stanzas are recited); N.
of the wife of Rāma-candra (daughter of Janaka,
king of Mithilā, capital of Videha, who was other-
wise called Sīra-dhvaja; she was named Sītā because

while ploughing the ground to prepare it for a sacri-
fice instituted by him to obtain progeny, whence
her epithet A-yoni-jā, ‘not womb-born;’ her other
common names, Maithilī and Vaidehī, are from the
place of her birth; according to one legend she was
Veda-vatī, q. v., in the Kṛta age; according to others
she was an incarnation of Lakṣmī and of Umā;
the story of Rāma's bending the bow, which was to be
the condition of the gift of Sītā, is told in Rāmāyaṇa
I. 67; Sītā's younger sister Ūrmilā was at the same
time given to Lakṣmaṇa, and two nieces of Ja-
naka, daughters of his brother king Kuśa-dhvaja, to
Bharata and Śatru-ghna); N. of Lakṣmī; of Durgā
