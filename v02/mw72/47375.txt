{#SrAdDa#}¦ {%śrāddha, as, ā, am%} (fr. {%śrad-dhā,%}
see {%śrad-dha%}), faithful, believing; ({%am%}), n., N.
of a kind of funeral rite or ceremony in honour of
the departed spirits of dead relatives observed with
great, strictness at various fixed periods and on oc-
casions of rejoicing as well as mourning, (these cere-
monies are of three principal kinds, 1. Nitya, i. e.
general and constant, in honour of the Pitṛs or
deceased ancestors and progenitors collectively [also
called {%pārvaṇa, aṣṭaka,%} q. q. v. v.], when three
Piṇḍas or balls of meal [see {%piṇḍa%}] and water are
offered to three paternal ancestors and three maternal
forefathers [see {%pitṛ%}]: 2. Naimittika, i. e. occasional
and special, as, for instance, in behalf of a parent or
some one relative recently deceased [called also
{%ekoddiṣṭa,%} q. v.]; the object being twofold, viz.
first, the re-embodying of his soul in some kind of
form after burning his corpse; secondly, the raising
him from the regions of the atmosphere, where he
would otherwise roam among demons and evil
spirits, to a particular heaven above, where he is, as
it were, deified among the shades of departed kins-
men; the offering of the funeral Piṇḍa or ball of
meal is in this case the office of the nearest male
kinsman, and confers the title to any property that
may be inherited: 3. Kāmya, i. e. voluntary and
performed apparently by way of supererogation for
the greater benefit of deceased ancestors or for ob-
taining increase of religious merit, &c.: other Śrād-
dha ceremonies and oblations appear to have more
reference to the living than the dead, and to be
performed either for the sake of {%puṣṭi%} and {%vṛddhi,%}
‘increase of prosperity,’ &c., or as thank-offerings on
various joyful occasions, such as the birth of a son,
when gifts and food are offered to the living relations
and assisting Brāhmans present: there is also an
important Śrāddha, called Daiva, in honour of the
Viśva-devas or Viśve Devāḥ, ‘deities collectively’
[see {%viśva%}]: the Śrāddha to a recently deceased
relative should be offered on the day after mourning
expires, and at intervals during twelve successive
months, and afterwards on all anniversaries of his
death; that to the Pitṛs collectively should take
place on the dark fortnight of a lunation as well as
at various other seasons, different names being given
to the various Śrāddhas according to the times and
objects of their performance, see {%aṣṭaka, ekādaśī,%}
