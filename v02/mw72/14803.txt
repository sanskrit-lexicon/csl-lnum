{#kila#} 2¦. {%kila,%} ind. (a particle of asseveration
or emphasis), indeed, verily, assuredly; (or of expla-
nation) namely; {%kila%} is preceded by the word on
which it lays stress, and occurs very rarely at the
beginning of a sentence or verse; according to native
lexicographers {%kila%} may be used in communicating
intelligence, and may imply ‘so said,’ ‘so reported,’
‘probably,’ ‘possibly,’ ‘agreement,’ ‘dislike,’ ‘false-
hood,’ ‘inaccuracy,’ and ‘reason.’
