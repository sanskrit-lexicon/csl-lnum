{#nu#} 1¦. {%nu,%} ind. (perhaps related to 1. {%nava;%}
cf. {%nūtana%}), written {%nū%} in Ved. at the beginning of
a verse and frequently in other places. (As an adverb
of time in Ved.), now, still (e. g. {%nū-ca purā-ca,%}
both now and heretofore; {%asti svin nu vīryaṃ tat%}
{%-te,%} hast thou still that power?). (As an inferential
particle in Ved. often beginning the last sentence of
a hymn), now therefore, now then, therefore, then
(e. g. {%nū no rāsva,%} do thou therefore give us):
(as an introductory particle, or in encouraging, in-
voking, inviting, summoning), now, then, pray,
come then (e. g. {%abhi nu mā cakṣamīthāḥ,%} pray
now [Sāy. quickly] have compassion upon me).
{%Nu%} is often employed in questions, both in Vedic and
classical Sanskrit, to strengthen an interrogative pro-
[Page0514-b+ 78]
noun or adverb (e. g. {%kadā nu,%} when indeed?
{%kathaṃ nu,%} how indeed? {%kva nu,%} where indeed?
{%kaṃ nu pṛcchāmi,%} whom can I possibly ask?
{%kiṃ nu syāt,%} what can that possibly be? {%kiṃ nu%}
{%khalu,%} why in the world?). {%Nu%} is also used inter-
rogatively in classical Sanskrit, without an interro-
gative pronoun, in sentences of two or more clauses
(e. g. {%svapno nu māyā nu mati-bhramo nu,%} was
it a dream? or an illusion of magic? or a mental
delusion?). {%Nu%} also serves as a particle of affirma-
tion, to express ‘indeed,’ ‘certainly,’ ‘surely’ (e. g.
{%ahaṃ nu akārṣam,%} Yes, I certainly did so), and
often gives emphasis to the word it follows without
being itself translateable, in which way it is frequently
connected in the Veda with other particles (e. g. with
{%cid%} in {%cin nu;%} with {%id%} in {%in nu;%} with {%adha%} in
{%adha nu;%} with {%gha%} in {%ghā nu,%} &c.); but in the
Veda {%nu%} sometimes means ‘never’ (especially in
the construction {%nū cit%} = never, nevermore; in other
passages it is said to = ‘from this time forward,’ ‘for
ever’). In classical Sanskrit {%nu%} is sometimes found
in connection with {%vā,%} ‘or;’ and in Rāmāyaṇa II.
72, 27, {%nu — nu%} may be translated ‘either’ — ‘or.’
According to native commentators on the Veda {%nu%}
often {%= kṣipram,%} quickly. According to native
lexicographers {%nu%} is used in the following senses:
{%pṛcchā, vikalpa, vitarka, anunaya, atīta, apa-%}
{%māna, hetu, apadeśa;%} [cf. {%nū-nam, nū-tana;%}
Zend {%nū,%} ‘just now;’ Gr. <lang n="greek">νύ, νῡ-νί, νῦν;</lang> Lat. <nsi>num,</nsi>
<nsi>nun-c;</nsi> Goth. <nsi>nu-h;</nsi> Old Germ. <nsi>nu;</nsi> Slav. <nsi>nyne,</nsi>
‘at present.’]
