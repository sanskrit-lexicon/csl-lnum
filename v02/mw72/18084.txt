{%Ca%}¦ may occasionally be disjunctive and be trans-
lated by ‘but,’ ‘on the contrary,’ ‘on the other
hand,’ ‘yet,’ ‘nevertheless’ (e. g. {%varam ādyau na%}
{%cāntimaḥ,%} better the two first but not the last;
{%śāntam idam āśrama-padaṃ sphurati ca bāhuḥ,%}
this hermitage is tranquil yet my arm throbs).
