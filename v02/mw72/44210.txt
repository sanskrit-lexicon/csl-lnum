({%viśvasmād Indra uttaraḥ,%} Indra is higher than
all, Ṛg-veda X. 86, 1), entire, whole, universal;
({%as%}), m., N. of a kind of deity belonging to a class
of ten (forming one of the nine Gaṇas or classes
enumerated under Gaṇa-devatā, q. v.: in Ṛg-veda
X. 130, 5. they are associated with the Jagatī metre,
and called Viśve devāḥ, which may have originally
denoted ‘all the gods collectively,’ though the intro-
duction of the Viśvas under the name {%viśva-devāḥ%}
or {%viśve-devāḥ,%} as a separate troop or Gaṇa of deities,
seems to have taken place at an early period: accord-
ing to the Viṣṇu and other Purāṇas they were sons
of Viśvā, daughter of Dakṣa, and their names are
given as follow, 1. Vasu, 2. Satya, 3. Kratu, 4.
Dakṣa, 5. Kāla, 6. Kāma, 7. Dhṛti, 8. Kuru, 9.
Purū-ravas, 10. Mādravas; two others are added by
some authorities, viz. 11. Rocaka or Locana, 12.
Dhvani [also written Dhūri ?]: they are particularly
worshipped at the Śrāddhas or funeral obsequies in
honour of deceased ancestors: moreover, according
to Manu III. 90, 121, offerings should be made to
them daily, — these privileges having been bestowed
on them, it is said, by Brahmā and the Pitṛs, as a
reward for certain severe austerities they had per-
formed on the Himālaya: sometimes, however, it is
difficult to decide whether the expression {%viśve devāḥ%}
refers to all the gods or to the particular troop of
deities described above); N. of Intellect in the Ve-
dānta philosophy, or (according to some) the faculty
which perceives Singleness, (perhaps translatable by
‘the Pervader;’ according to a commentator {%=%}
{%sthūla-śarīra-vyaṣṭy-upahita-caitanya,%} ‘intel-
lect located in the distributive aggregate of material
bodies’); N. of a well known lexicon, {%= viśva-pra-%}
{%kāśa,%} q. v.; ({%ā%}), f., N. of a daughter of Dakṣa and
wife of Dharma; the plant Aconitum Ferox; a tree
used for dying red (commonly called Atis = Betula);
the shrub Asparagus Racemosus ({%= śatāvarī%});

the whole world, universe, whole creation; dry ginger.
{%—Viśva-kadru, us, us, u,%} wicked, vile; ({%us%}), m.

{%karman, ā,%} m. ‘one who does universal acts, all-
doer, all-creator, all-maker,’ N. of the architect or
artist of the gods (said to be son of Brahmā, and in
the later mythology sometimes identified with Tvash-
ṭṛ, q. v., not only as an architect, but as a kind of
chief engineer or forger of divine weapons, and in-
ventor of the {%agny-astra,%} q. v.; in this capacity
Viśva-karman is said to have revealed the Sthāpatya-
veda, q. v., or fourth Upa-veda, and to preside over
all manual labours as well as the sixty-four mechanical
arts, [whence he is worshipped by Kārus or artizans];
in the Vedic mythology, however, the office of Indian
Vulcan is assigned to Tvaṣṭṛ as a distinct deity,
Viśva-karman being rather identified with Prajā-pati
[Brahmā] himself as the creator of all things and
architect of the universe; in the hymns Ṛg-veda X.
81, 82. he is represented as the universal Father and
Generator, the one all-seeing God, who has on every
side eyes, faces, arms, and feet, who blows forth heaven
and earth with his arms and wings, who knows all
worlds, gives the gods their names, and is beyond
the comprehension of mortals; in Nirukta X. 26.
and elsewhere in the Brāhmaṇas he is called a son
of Bhuvana, and Viśva-karman Bhauvana is described
as the author of the two Ṛg-veda hymns X. 81, 82,
mentioned above; moreover, a doubtful legend is told
of his having offered up all beings, including himself,
in sacrifice; the Rāmāyaṇa represents him as having
built the city of Laṅkā for the Rākṣasas, and as
[Page0944-b+ 81]
having generated the ape Nala, who made Rāma's
bridge from the continent to the island; the name
Viśva-karman, meaning ‘doing all acts,’ appears to
be sometimes applicable as an epithet to any great
divinity); epithet of Sūrya or the Sun; of one of the
seven principal rays of the sun (supposed to supply
heat to the planet Mercury); epithet of Mahā-deva
(Mahā-bh. Śānti-parvan 10332); epithet of Indra
(Ṛg-veda VIII. 87, 2); of a son of the Vasu Pra-
bhāsa; any great saint. {%—Viśvakarma-sutā%} or

N. of a celebrated Kṣatriya, described as son of
Gāthin or Gādhi, deriving his lineage from an an-
cestor of Kuśika, named Purū-ravus, of the lunar race
[Page0945-b+ 81]
of kings, and himself sovereign of Kanyā-kubja or
Kanoj, (according to one account he was brother of
Satya-vatī, wife of Ṛcīka and mother by him of
Jamad-agni, q. v., who was the father of Paraśu-rāma;
he had one hundred sons, fifty of whom offended
their father, and being degraded by him to the con-
dition of outcasts, became the progenitors of various
barbarous tribes and Dasyus: the fame of Viśvā-
mitra rests chiefly on his contests with the great
Brāhman Vasiṣṭha, and his success in elevating him-
self, though a Kṣatriya, to the rank of a Brāhman,
see Manu VII. 42: the Rāmāyaṇa, which makes
him a companion and counsellor of the young Rāma-
candra, records [I. 51-65] how Viśvā-mitra, on his
accession to the throne, visited the hermitage of
Vasiṣṭha, and seeing there the cow of plenty [proba-
bly typical of {%go,%} ‘the earth’], offered the Muni un-
told treasures in exchange for it, but being refused,
prepared to take it by force; a long contest ensued
between the king and the saint [symbolical of the
struggles between the Kṣatriya and Brāhmanical
classes], which ended in the defeat of Viśvā-mītra,
whose vexation was such that, in order to become a
Brāhman and thus conquer his rival, he devoted
himself to intense austerities, gradually increasing the
rigour of his mortification through thousands of years,
till he successively earned the titles of Rājarṣi, Ṛṣi,
Maharṣi, and finally Brahmarṣi; during the course
of these penances Indra and the gods jealous of his
increasing power — as exhibited in his transporting
king Tri-śaṅku to the skies, and in saving his nephew
Śunaḥ-śepha, son of his own brother-in-law Ṛcīka,
out of the hands of Indra, to whom he had been
promised by king Ambarīṣa as a victim in a sacri-
fice — sent first the nymph Menakā and subsequently
Rambhā to seduce him from his passionless life, and
his surrender to the allurements of the first of these
nymphs led to the birth of a daughter called Śakun-
talā, q. v., the heroine of the celebrated drama; the
rivalry between Viśvā-mitra and Vasiṣṭha is alluded
to in many passages of the Ṛg-veda; it is thought,
therefore, that as caste distinctions had not then
become fixed, the later myths on the subject of this
rivalry may have rested on a Vedic legend, according
to which king Su-dās, having employed Vasiṣṭha as
his domestic priest, allowed on various occasions Viśvā-
mitra also to officiate, which of course led to jealousies
and quarrels between these two functionaries: the whole
of the hymns of the third Maṇḍala of the Ṛg-veda
and a few others are attributed to Viśvā-mitra or to
members of his family); {%Viśvāmitrasyātyardha,%}
