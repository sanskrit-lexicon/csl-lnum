{#ni#}¦ {%ni%} (an indeclinable prefix to verbs and
nouns, used as a preposition except in one passage
in Atharva-veda X. 8, 7, where it stands alone as an
adverb), in, into, within; down, under, back; on,
upon. As a prefix to nouns {%ni%} appears sometimes to
be a curtailed form of {%nis%} in its sense of ‘without,’
‘deprived of’ (e. g. in {%ni-kilviṣa, ni-khila,%} q. v.),
but the idea of negation in such compounds may pos-
sibly be derived from the meanings ‘down,’ ‘down-
wards,’ ‘back,’ which properly belong to {%ni;%} occasion-
ally, however, {%ni%} is inaccurately written for {%niḥ (=%}
{%nis),%} as in {%ni-śabda%} for {%niḥ-śabda;%} according to
native lexicographers the senses in which {%ni%} may be
used are expressed by the following Sanskrit words,
{%kṣepa, bhṛśārtha, nityārtha, dāna, san-ni-%}
{%dhāna, upa-rama, saṃ-śraya, ā-śraya, rāśi, %}

{%mokṣa, antar-bhāva, adho-bhāva, bandhana,%}
{%kauśala, ni-veśa, vi-ny-āsa;%} [{%ni%} is thought by
some to be for primitive {%ani;%} cf. {%an-tar, an-tarā;%}
