924) {%= buddhi; (am),%} n. {%= brahma,%} that which is
divine, the divine (Ved.); sacred or divine power
(Ved.); that portion of the Veda, as distinct from
the Mantra portion, which was composed by and for
Brāhmans and contains rules for the employment of
the Mantras or hymns at various sacrifices, detailed
explanations of these sacrifices, their origin and
meaning, with tedious illustrations in the way of
legends and old stories; (this Brāhmaṇa portion of
the Veda is a kind of Hindū Talmud, but like the
Mantra portion it was {%śruta,%} i. e. heard by the sages to
whom it was revealed and is therefore regarded as an
integral part of {%śruti%} or revelation; it is said by
Sāyaṇa to contain two parts, 1. {%vidhi,%} rules or direc-
tions for rites; 2. {%artha-vāda,%} explanatory remarks);
N. of a well-known class of Vedic works in prose
which contain the Brāhmaṇa portion of the Veda as
explained above, (each of the four Vedas has its own
Brāhmaṇa appended to it; the Brāhmaṇa of the
Bahvṛcas or priests of the Ṛg-veda is still preserved
in two works, viz. the Aitareya, sometimes called
Āśvalāyana, consisting of eight Pañcikās or pentads
of Adhyāyas, subdivided into 285 sections or Khaṇḍas,
and the Kauṣītaki-Brāhmaṇa, sometimes called Śāṅ-
khāyana, which two Brāhmaṇas do not follow the order
of the hymns of the Ṛg-veda, but quote them as
they are required for the Hotṛ priest, part of the
Aitareya being also a kind of commentary on the
commencement of the Ṛg-veda, and the latter
portion giving an elaborate description of the Abhi-
sheka ceremony or inauguration of kings; the white
Yajur-veda has the Śatapatha-Brāhmaṇa, which is per-
haps the most modern and interesting of all these
compositions; and the black Yajur-veda has the Brāh-
maṇa of the Taittirīyas, which though distinct from
its Saṃhitā differs little from it; the Sāma-veda has
eight Brāhmaṇas, the best known of which are the
Prauḍha or Pañca-viṃśa and the Ṣaḍ-viṃśa; the
Atharva-veda has one Brāhmaṇa called Go-patha);

assemblage of Brāhmans, a conclave. {%—Brāhmaṇa-%}
