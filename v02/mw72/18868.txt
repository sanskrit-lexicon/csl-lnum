{#ced#}¦ {%ced%} (originally 2. {%ca + id%}), a compound
particle, never found at the beginning of a sentence
or verse. In the Veda it is sometimes used as a
conjunction, like the simple {%ca,%} in the sense of ‘and,’
‘also,’ ‘even.’ But in Vedic as well as classical
Sanskrit the most usual sense of {%ced%} is ‘if,’ ‘although,’
‘provided that,’ ‘when,’ and in these senses it may
[Page0329-c+ 74]
be joined with the present indicative (e. g. {%mahyaṃ%}
{%ced dadāti tat,%} if he gives that to me); or with
the future (e. g. {%tṛṣṇāṃ cet tyakṣyati,%} if he
shall abandon avarice); or with the conditional (e. g.
{%vṛṣṭiś ced abhaviṣyat,%} if there should have been
rain); or with the potential (e. g. {%gacchec cet,%} if
he should go); or with the perfect (e. g. {%sa cen ma-%}
{%māra,%} when he died); or with a participle (e. g.
{%kartavyaṃ cet priyam mahyam,%} if a kindness is
to be done to me). It should be observed that in
the Veda the verb which depends on {%ced%} retains
its accent.
<div n="P"/>The negative particle {%na%} may be prefixed to {%ced%}
either immediately or separated from it (e. g. {%na%}
{%ced vacaḥ kariṣyati%} or {%na kariṣyati ced vacaḥ,%}
if he should not make a speech); and frequently the
negative {%no%} is used in connection with {%ced,%} the
verb being understood (e. g. {%dūram apasara no%}
{%ced dhantavyo'si mayā,%} depart to a distance, if not,
i. e. if thou departest not, thou art to be killed by me).
Sometimes {%no ced = api na,%} would that not! (e. g.
{%no ced evaṃ kuryāt,%} would that he did not so!).
Rarely {%yadi%} and {%ced%} are joined together, when {%ced%}
may be translated by ‘that is,’ ‘that is to say,’ ‘namely’
(e. g. {%yadi ced rājyam avāpsyati,%} if, that is, he
shall obtain the kingdom). In the argumentative
writings of native commentators {%ced%} preceded by {%iti%}
and followed by {%na%} is often placed at the end of an
objector's statement (e. g. ‘{%Ṛg-vedam adhyemi%}’
{%ityādi vākyam pramāṇam iti cen na,%} if it be urged
that the text ‘I peruse the Ṛg-veda’ is a proof, no,
it is not so). {%Atha ced,%} but if; [cf. {%ned.%}]
