{%Kārttikeya, as,%}¦ m., N. of Skanda, the god of war, so
called because reared by the six Kṛttikās or Pleiades;
(according to one legend he was son of Śiva without
the intervention of his wife, his generative energy
being cast into the fire and then received by the
Ganges, whence he is sometimes described as son of
Agni and Gaṅgā; when born he was fostered by the
Pleiades, who offering their six breasts the child be-
came six-headed. In other accounts he is described
as a son of Śiva and Pārvatī or Durgā. Skanda
may have been called Kārttikeya because the month
Kārttikā is the best for warfare: he is sometimes
described as presiding over thieves.) {%—Kārttikeya-%}
{%prasū, ūs,%} f. an epithet of Durgā or Pārvatī, who,
according to one legend, was the mother of Skanda.
