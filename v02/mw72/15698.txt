descended from Aṅgiras; N. of a celebrated Avatār
of the god Viṣṇu, or sometimes identified with
Viṣṇu himself, as distinct from his ten Avatārs
or incarnations. (In the earlier legends he ap-
pears as a great hero and teacher; in the more
recent he is deified, and is often represented as
a young and amorous shepherd with flowing hair
and a flute in his hand. The following are a few
particulars of his birth and history as related in the
Purāṇas &c.: Vasu-deva, who was a descendant of Yadu
and Yayāti, had two wives, Rohiṇī and Devakī.
The latter had eight sons, of whom the eighth was
Kṛṣṇa. Kaṃsa, king of Mathurā and cousin of
Devakī, was informed by a prediction that one of
these sons would kill him. He therefore kept Vasu-
deva and his wife in confinement, and slew their first
six children. The seventh was Bala-rāma, who was
saved by being abstracted from the womb of Devakī
and transferred to that of Rohiṇī. The eighth was
Kṛṣṇa, who was born with black skin and a peculiar
mark on his breast. His father Vasu-deva managed
to escape from Mathurā with the child, and favoured
by the gods found a herdsman named Nanda, whose
wife Yaśodā had just been delivered of a son, which
Vasu-deva conveyed to Devakī, after substituting his
own in its place. Nanda with his wife Yaśodā took
the infant Kṛṣṇa and settled first in Gokula or
Vraja, and afterwards in Vṛndāvana, where Kṛṣṇa
and Bala-rāma grew up together, roaming in the
woods and joining in the sports of the herdsmen's
sons. Kṛṣṇa as a youth contested the sovereignty
of Indra, and was victorious over that god, who
descended from heaven to praise Kṛṣṇa, and made
him lord over the cattle. Kṛṣṇa is described as
sporting constantly with the Gopīs or shepherdesses,
of whom a thousand became his wives, though only
eight are specified, Rādhā being the favourite. Kṛṣṇa
built and fortified a city called Dvāraka in Gujarāt,
and thither transported the inhabitants of Mathurā
after killing Kaṃsa. Kṛṣṇa had various wives be-
sides the Gopīs, and by Rukmiṇī had a son Pra-
dyumna, who is usually identified with Kāma-deva;
with Jainas, Kṛṣṇa is one of the nine black Vasu-devas;
with Buddhists he is the chief of the black demons,
who are the enemies of Buddha and the white
demons); N. of a king of the Nāgas; N. of an
Asura or demon; N. of Arjuna, the most renowned
