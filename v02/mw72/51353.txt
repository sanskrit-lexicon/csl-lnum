1. 12. enumerated among the {%udaka-nāmāni,%} and
in 1. 11. among the {%vāṅ-nāmāni%}); [cf. Old Norse
<nsi>sir, sœr, sior;</nsi> Angl. Sax. <nsi>sirendœ.</nsi>] {%—Saraḥ-%}

{%—Sarasi-ruha, am,%} n. ‘growing in a pond,’ a

‘pool-growing,’ a lotus. {%—Saras-tīra, am,%} n. the

‘having water,’ watery, fluid, juicy, sapid; elegant;
sentimental; ({%ān%}), m. the ocean; a male river; N.
of a river-god, (in Ṛg-veda VII. 96, 4-6. assigned
as a consort to Sarasvatī, see below); N. of Vāyu,
(according to Sāy. on Ṛg-veda VII. 95, 3 {%=%}
{%madhya-sthāno vayuḥ%}); a buffalo; ({%atī%}), f., N.
of the goddess of speech and learning, (in the later
mythology regarded as the wife or female energy of
the god Brahmā or first deity of the Hindū triad
[see {%brahman%}], and sometimes identified with Vāc,
q. v., and invoked as a kind of muse or patroness of
science and inventress of the Sanskrit language and
letters; in the earliest mythology she was probably
a river-deity, her name signifying ‘watery;’ according
to Yāska [Nirukta II. 23] she was regarded both as
a river and as a goddess; probably this river was to
the earlier Hindūs what the Ganges [said to be only
twice named in the Ṛg-veda] was to the later;
sacrifices were doubtless performed on its banks, and
its sanctity imparted a sacred character to the district
lying between its waters and those of the Dṛṣad-
vatī [see Manu II. 17]; hence the river Sarasvatī
was not only personified as a river-goddess, but her
assistance was invoked at the sacrifices performed
near her flowing waters and her influence held to
be necessary for inspiring the Ṛṣis who composed
the sacrificial hymns with eloquence and wisdom; in
Ṛg-veda II. 41, 16. she is called the best of mothers,
of rivers, and of goddesses; in other places she is
described as bestowing wealth, fertility, and offspring,
as moving along a golden path, as destroying Vṛtra,
as associated with the Aśvins, and even as the wife
of Indra; in Ṛg-veda VI. 61, 10-12, VII. 36, 6.
she is called the mother of rivers, and is said to be
sevenfold or to have seven sisters; in Mahā-bhārata,
Śalya-parvan 2189, seven Sarasvatīs are also men-
tioned, viz. Su-prabhā, Kāñcanākṣī, Viśālā, Mano-
ramā, Ogha-vatī, Su-reṇu, and Vimalodakā; in the
Śānti-parvan 12920, Sarasvatī is called the mother
of the Vedas, which is also elsewhere said of Vāc,
though Vāc in the earlier mythology is regarded as
a separate deity; according to later legends the
goddess Sarasvatī was persuaded to descend from
heaven and confer her invention of language and
letters on the human race by the sage Bharata,
[Page1093-a+ 81]
whence one of her names is Bhāratī; she is some-
times represented as assuming the form of a Haṃsa
or swan, and is also called Mahā-śvetā or Mahā-
śuklā from her extreme whiteness); N. of a cele-
brated river (held very sacred by the Hindūs and in
the earlier mythology mixed up with the goddess
[see above]; it corresponds with the modern Sur-
sooty, which rises in the mountains bounding the
north-east part of the province of Delhi, and running
in a south-westerly direction becomes lost in the
sands of the great desert; this river formerly marked
one of the boundaries of the region called Ārya-deśa,
and of a particularly sacred district called in Manu
II. 17. Brahmāvarta; in Ṛg-veda VII. 95, 2. it is
represented as flowing into the sea, although later
legends make it disappear underground and join the
Ganges and Jumnā at Allahabad, see {%tri-veṇī, pra-%}
