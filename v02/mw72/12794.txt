{#evam#}¦ {%evam,%} ind. (cf. 1. {%eva%} and {%etad%}), so,
thus, in this way, in such a manner, such. {%Evam%} is
not found in the oldest hymns of the Veda, where its
place is taken by {%eva,%} but occurs in later hymns and
in the Brāhmaṇas, especially in connection with the
rt. {%vid,%} ‘to know,’ and its derivatives (e. g. {%ya evaṃ%}
{%veda,%} he who knows so; cf. {%evaṃ-vid%} below). In
classical Sanskrit {%evam%} occurs very frequently, espe-
cially in connection with the roots {%vac,%} ‘to speak,’
and {%śru,%} ‘to hear,’ and refers to what precedes as
well as to what follows (e. g. {%evam uktvā,%} having so
said; {%evamevaitat,%} this is so; {%evam astu%} or {%evam%}
{%bhavatu,%} be it so, I assent; {%asty evam,%} it is so;
{%yady evam,%} if this be so; {%kim evam,%} how so?
what is the meaning of it? what does this refer to?
{%maivam,%} not so! {%evam — yathā%} or {%yathā — evam,%}
so — as). {%Evam%} is often used like an adjective (e. g.
{%evaṃ te vacane rataḥ,%} rejoicing in such words of
thine; where {%evam = evaṃ-vidhe%}). Sometimes
{%evam%} is merely an expletive. According to lexico-
graphers {%evam%} may imply likeness (so); sameness
of manner (thus); assent (yes, verily); affirmation
(certainly, indeed, assuredly); command (thus, &c.);
and be used as an expletive. {%—Evaṃ-rūpa, as, ā, am,%}
