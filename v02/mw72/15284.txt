{#kuru#}¦ {%kuru, avas,%} m. pl. (said to be fr. 1. {%kṛ%}),
N. of a people of India and their country, situated
near the country of the Pañcālas (hence often con-
nected with Pañcāla or Pāñcāla; see {%kuru-pañcāla%}
below); the Kurus derive their origin from Kuru (son
of Saṃvaraṇa and Tapatī, daughter of the Sun), who
is the ancestor of both Pāṇḍu and Dhṛta-rāṣṭra,
though the patronymic derived from his name is
usually applied only to the sons of the latter, the sons
and descendants of the former being called Pāṇḍavas;
another Kuru is the son of Agnīdhra and grandson of
Priya-vrata. The {%uttara-kuravaḥ%} or {%uttarāḥ kura-%}
{%vaḥ%} are the northern Kurus, the most northerly of the
four Mahā-dvīpas or principal divisions of the known
world (distinguished Mahā-bh. I. 4346. from the {%dak-%}
{%ṣiṇāḥ kuravaḥ%} or southern Kurus), by other sys-
tems regarded as one of nine divisions or Varṣas of
the same; it was probably a country beyond the most
northern range of the Himālaya, often described
as a country of everlasting happiness, and considered
by some to be the ancient home of the Āryan race.
