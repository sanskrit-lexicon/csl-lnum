{#jahnu#}¦ {%jahnu, us,%} m., N. of an ancient king
and sage who adopted the Gaṅgā as his daughter,
(the river Ganges, when brought down from heaven
by the austerities of Bhagīratha, was forced to flow
over the earth and to follow him to the ocean, and
thence to the lower regions, for the purpose of
watering the ashes of Sagara's sons. In its course it
inundated the sacrificial ground of Jahnu, who there-
fore drank up its waters, but consented at the prayer
of Bhagīratha to discharge them from his ears.
Hence the river is regarded as his daughter, and is
called Jāhnavī); N. of a son of Aja-mīḍha, of a son
of Su-hotra, of Kuru, and of Hotraka; N. of an
ancestor of the Kuśikas; a N. of Viṣṇu; ({%avas%}),
