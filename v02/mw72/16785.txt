{#Kalu#}¦ {%khalu,%} ind. (as a particle of assevera-
tion or affirmation), indeed, verily, certainly, truly,
yes; (as a continuative particle), now, now then, now
further; (as a particle employed in syllogistic forms
of speech), but now, = the Latin <nsi>atqui.</nsi> It occurs
only once in the Ṛg-veda; oftener in the Brāhmaṇas
and Buddhist compositions, especially when combined
with other particles, thus {%atha khalu, u khalu,%}
{%vai khalu,%} and {%khalu vai,%} = now then, now further.
In later Sanskrit {%khalu%} frequently does little more
than lay stress on the word by which it is preceded,
and is sometimes merely an expletive. According
to native lexicographers {%khalu%} is also a particle of
prohibition, endearment, conciliation, and inquiry.
{%Na khalu,%} by no means, not at all, indeed not.
