{%Ka%}¦ is occasionally used alone as an indefinite pro-
noun, especially in negative sentences (e. g. {%na kasya%}
{%ko vallabhaḥ,%} no one is a favourite of any one;
{%nānyo jānāti kaḥ,%} no one else knows; {%kathaṃ sa%}
{%ghātayati kam,%} how does he kill any one? More
usually, however, {%ka%} is only made indefinite when con-
nected with the particles {%ca, cana, cid, vā,%} and {%api,%}
in which case {%ka%} may sometimes be preceded by the
relative {%ya%} (e. g. {%ye ke ca,%} any persons whatsoever;
{%yasyai kasyai ca devatāyai,%} to any deity whatso-
ever; {%yāni kāni ca mitrāṇi,%} any friends whatsoever;
{%yat kiñca,%} whatever). The particle {%cana,%} being
composed of {%ca%} and {%na,%} properly gives a negative
force to the pronoun (e. g. {%yasmād Indrād ṛte%}
{%kiñcana,%} without which Indra there is nothing), but
the negative sense is generally dropped (e. g. {%kaścana,%}
any one; {%na kaścana,%} no one), and a relative is
sometimes connected with it (e. g. {%yat kiñcana,%}
anything whatsoever). Examles of {%cid%} with the
interrogative are common; {%vā%} and {%api%} are not so
common, but the latter is often found in classical
Sanskrit (e. g. {%kaścid,%} any one; {%kecid,%} some; {%na%}
{%kaścid,%} no one; {%na kiñcid api,%} nothing whatso-
ever; {%yaḥ kaścid,%} any one whatsoever; {%kecit — %}
{%kecit,%} some — others; {%yasmin kasmin vā deśe,%} in
any country whatsoever; {%na ko 'pi,%} no one; {%na%}
{%kimapi,%} nothing whatever).
