brated for having devoted himself to death that the
gods might be armed with his bones, (his story is

pressed by the Kālakeya Asuras, solicited from the
sage his bones, and with them Tvaṣṭṛ fabricated
the thunderbolt with which Indra slew Vṛtra and
routed the Asuras; the Saras-vatī receives his gene-
rative energy, from which springs Sāras-vata.) {%—Da-%}
