{%Mīmāṃsā,%}¦ f. reflection, consideration, opinion,
investigation, examination, discussion, ({%kāvya-m°,%}
the theory of poetry, art of poetry; N. of a work);
‘examination (of the sacred text),’ N. of one of three
great divisions of orthodox Hindū philosophy (divided
like the Nyāya and Sāṅkhya into two systems, viz.
the Pūrva-mīmāṃsā or Karma-mīmāṃsā founded by
Jaimini, and the Uttara-mīmāṃsā or Brahma-mīmāṃsā
or Śārīraka-mīmāṃsā by Bādarāyaṇa, the latter, how-
ever, is more commonly called the Vedānta system,
while the Pūrva-mīmāṃsā is usually called <nsi>the</nsi>
Mīmāṃsā; though the Mīmāṃsā by Jaimini is classed
among the six orthodox systems of philosophy, it
does not concern itself like the others with the
nature of soul, mind, and matter, but rather with a
correct interpretation of the ritual of the Veda and
the solution of doubts and discrepancies in regard to
the Vedic texts caused by the discordant explanations
of opposite schools; it may therefore be described as
a critical commentary on the first or ritual portion
of the Veda, and its only claim to the title of a
philosophy consists in its philosophical method of
interpretation, the topics being arranged according
to particular categories, such as authoritativeness,
indirect precept, &c., and treated according to a
kind of logical sequence, which commences with
the proposition to be discussed, the doubt arising
about it, the Pūrva-pakṣa or primâ facie and wrong
view of the question, the right argument or refuta-
tion of the Pūrva-pakṣa, and the conclusion; see,

moreover, {%Pūrva-mīmāṃsā:%} Jaimini, whose date is
unknown, taught his system in twelve books, each
book containing either four or eight chapters, and
each chapter being subdivided into sections compris-
ing one or more Sūtras; the oldest commentary on
these obscure aphorisms being the Bhāṣya of Śabara-
svāmin, explained by the great Mīmāṃsā authority
Kumārila-svāmin or Kumārila-bhaṭṭa, and again elu-
cidated by Mādhavācārya in the Jaiminīya-nyāya-
mālā-vistara). {%—Mīmāṃsa-kṛt, t,%} m. ‘the author of
