{#om#}¦ {%om,%} ind. (said to be fr. rt. {%av;%} perhaps
originally {%oṃ,%} which may be derived fr. {%āṃ,%} and this
fr. {%ā%}), a word of solemn affirmation and respectful
assent (sometimes translated by yes, verily, so be it,
and in this sense compared with Amen). It is placed
at the commencement of most Hindū works, and as
a sacred exclamation may be uttered (but not so as
to be heard by ears profane) at the beginning and
end of a reading of the Vedas or previously to any
prayer. It is also regarded as a particle of auspicious
salutation (Hail!). {%Om%} appears first in the Upani-
shads as a mystic monosyllable, and is there set forth
as the object of profound religious meditation, the
highest spiritual efficacy being attributed not only to
the whole word but also to the three sounds {%a, u, m,%}
of which it consists. In later times {%om%} is the mystic
name for the Hindū triad, and represents the union of
the three gods, viz. {%a%} (Viṣṇu), {%u%} (Śiva), {%m%} (Brahmā).
It may also be typical of the three Vedas. {%Om%} is
usually called {%praṇava,%} more rarely {%akṣaram%} or
{%ekākṣaram,%} and only in later times {%oṃ-kāra.%}
The Buddhists use {%om%} at the commencement of
their {%vidyā ṣaḍ-akṣarī%} or mystical formulary in
six syllables (viz. {%om māni padme hūṃ%}). Lexico-
graphers affirm that besides the above uses, {%om%} may
imply command or injunction, removal or warding
off (Away! Hence!), and be used as an inceptive par-
ticle. Grammarians assert that before {%om%} a preced-
ing {%a%} or {%ā%} at the end of a word should be cut off
(e. g. {%vijayoṅkāraḥ%} for {%vijayauṅkāraḥ (°ya-oṅ°),%}
thanksgiving for victory; see Gram. 38. <nsi>b</nsi>). {%—Oṃ-kāra,%}
{%as,%} m. the sacred and mystical syllable {%om;%} the ex-
clamation {%om;%} pronouncing the syllable {%om; (ā),%} f.
a Buddhist Śakti or female personification of divine
energy. {%—Oṃkāra-grantha, as,%} m. title of a work
of Nārāyaṇa. {%—Oṃkāra-tīrtha,%} N. of a Tīrtha.
{%—Oṃkāra-bhaṭṭa, as,%} m., N. of a man.
