{#kunti#}¦ {%kunti, ayas,%} m. pl., N. of a people;
({%is%}), m. sing. the prince of this people, also called
Kunti-bhoja; {%Kunti%} is, according to different authori-
ties, a son of either Dharmanetra, or of Netra and
grandson of Dharma, or of Kratha, or of Vidarbha
and father of Dhṛṣṭa, or of Supārśva and grandson
of Sampāti and great-grandson of Garuḍa; ({%ī%}), f.
a N. of Pṛthā, the daughter of a Yādava prince
named Śūra, who gave her to his childless cousin
Kunti or Kunti-bhoja, by whom she was adopted.
She afterwards became one of the two wives of
Pāṇḍu. (On one occasion before her marriage she
paid such respect to the powerful sage Durvāsas that
he taught her an incantation or charm, by virtue of
which she was to have a child by any god she liked
to invoke. Out of curiosity she invoked the Sun,
by whom she had a child, cf. {%karṇa;%} but the Sun
afterwards restored to her her maidenhood. Soon
after his marriage Pāṇḍu retired to the woods to
indulge his passion for hunting. There he killed a
male and female deer, who turned out to be a Ṛṣi
and his wife in the form of these animals. The sage
cursed Pāṇḍu and predicted that he would die in the
embrace of one of his wives. Hence Pāṇḍu lived
apart from Kunti, but with his approval she made
use of her charm and had three sons, Yudhiṣṭhira,
Bhīma, and Arjuna, by the three deities Dharma,
Vāyu, and Indra respectively; cf. {%mādrī%}); N. of a
Rākṣasī; the wife of a Brāhman; the plant Bos-
wellia Thurifera; a fragrant resin {%(= guggulu).%}
