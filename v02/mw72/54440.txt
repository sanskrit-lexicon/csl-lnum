{#holAkA#}¦ {%holākā,%} f. (perhaps fr. the sound
made in singing), the spring festival held at the ap-
proach of the vernal equinox (commonly called Hūlī
or Holī, and one of the most popular festivals in India;
it is said to be dedicated to Kṛṣṇa and the Gopīs,
and is properly celebrated during the ten days pre-
ceding the full moon of the month Phālguna, q. v.,
but usually only for the last three or four days ending
with the full moon; the chief observances described
are sprinkling one another with red or yellow
powder in sport, addressing passers-by with jokes,
singing songs in praise of the young Kṛṣṇa, and
lighting fires around which rude frolics are practised;
in Marāṭhī the name Holī is said to be applied also
[Page1179-a+ 73]
to the pile prepared for the fire; in some parts of
India the Holī festival corresponds to or immediately
precedes the Dola-yātrā).
