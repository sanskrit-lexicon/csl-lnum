{%Śunaḥ-śepa%}¦ or {%śunaḥ-śepha, as,%} m. ({%śunaḥ,%}
gen. c. of {%śvan%}), ‘dog-tailed,’ N. of a Vedic Ṛṣi
(having the patronymic Ājigarti, as son of Ajigarta
or Ajīgarta, and regarded as the author of the hymns
Ṛg-veda I. 24-30, IX. 3; according to a legend
told in the Aitareya-Brāhmaṇa VII. 13-18, king
Hariścandra, whose priest was Viśvā-mitra, being
childless, made a vow that on obtaining a son he
would sacrifice him to the god Varuṇa; a son was
then born to him named Rohita, but Hariścandra
put off on various pretexts the fulfilment of his vow,
and when he at length consented to perform it, his
son declined being sacrificed, and retiring to the
forest passed six years there until he met a poor
Brāhman Ṛṣi named Ajīgarta, who had three sons,
the second of whom, Śunaḥ-śepha, was purchased by
Rohita for a hundred cows to serve as a substitute
for himself; Varuṇa having accepted him as a ransom,
he was about to be sacrificed, Viśvā-mitra being Hotṛ
priest, when he saved himself by reciting verses in
praise of various deities, and was received into the
family of Viśvā-mitra as one of his sons under the
name of Deva-rāta, q. v.: the legend is different in
the Rāmāyaṇa, which makes Ambarīṣa, king of
Ayodhyā, perform a sacrifice, the victim of which is
stolen by Indra; this king is described as wandering
over the earth in search of either the real victim or
a substitute until he meets with a Brāhman named
Ṛcīka, from whom he purchases his middle son,
Śunaḥ-śepha, who is about to be sacrificed, when
Viśvā-mitra saves him by teaching him a prayer to
Agni and two hymns to Indra and Viṣṇu; see
Rāmāyaṇa I. 61, 62); ({%am%}), n. the genital organ
of a dog.
