{%Tvaṣṭṛ, ṭā,%}¦ m. a carpenter, builder, workman,
maker of carriages, &c. [cf. {%taṣṭṛ%}]; N. of a god,
sometimes identified with the later deity Viśva-
karman, (he is the builder and architect <lang n="greek">κατ᾽ ἐξοχήν</lang>
and the Vulcan of the Hindūs; hence in the Veda he
has the epithets {%su-pāṇi, su-gabhasti, sv-apas, su-%}
{%kṛt, viśva-rūpa, puru-rūpa,%} &c.: he makes the
various implements of the gods, especially the
thunderbolt of Indra, and is said to have taught the
Ṛbhus who are also skilful workmen: he is some-
times regarded as the creator himself, and as forming
the bodies of men and animals is invoked for the
sake of offspring, especially in the Āprī hymns;
elsewhere he is associated with other similar deities,
e. g. Dhātṛ, Savitṛ, Prajā-pati, and Pūṣan; as
Indra is accompanied by the Vasus, Rudra by the
Rudras, so Tvaṣṭṛ is surrounded by the divine
females called Gnās, Janayas, Devānām Patnyaḥ, who
may be regarded as the recipients of his generative
energy; he has a son Viśva-rūpa or Tri-śiras, a
daughter Saraṇyū (or Sureṇu, Svareṇu, Sañjñā), wife
of Vivasvat, the children of whom are the Aśvins,
and Vāyu is called his son-in-law: Indra overpowers
Tvaṣṭṛ and recovers the Soma, which, according to
the Brāhmaṇas, was concealed by the latter because
Indra had killed his son Viśva-rūpa: Tvaṣṭṛ is
the deity of the Nakṣatra Citrā, regent of the fifth
Yuga or of the fifth cycle of Jupiter; and is also a
form of the sun, the N. being derived by Yāska in
Nirukta VIII. 13. fr. the rt. {%tviṣ,%} ‘to shine,’ and
being applied in Ṛg-veda 1. 84, 15, to one of
the Ādityas; it is also in the sense ‘shining,’
‘brilliant,’ applied to Agni and to Vāyu as well as to
the Rudras); N. of a prince, a son of Manasyu
(Bhauvana). {%—Tvaṣṭṛ-mat%} or {%tvaṣṭī-mat, ān, atī,%}
{%at,%} Ved. connected with or accompanied by Tvaṣṭṛ.
