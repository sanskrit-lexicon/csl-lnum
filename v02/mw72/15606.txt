{%Kṛtvas,%}¦ ind. at the end of a numeral or numeral
adjective, = fold, times (e. g. {%daśa-kṛtvas,%} ten times;
{%bahu-kṛtvas,%} many times; {%pañca-kṛtvas,%} five-fold).
In the earlier language {%kṛtvas%} is used as a separate
word, but native grammarians regard it only as an
affix, and it is so used in classical Sanskrit; it was
perhaps originally an acc. plur. fr. a noun {%kṛtu,%}
formed by the affix {%tu%} fr. the root 1. {%kṛ;%} [cf. also
{%kṛt%} in {%sakṛt.%}]
