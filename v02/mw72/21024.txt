{#tu#} 3¦. {%tu,%} ind. (a particle, perhaps connected
with the pronom. base 2. {%ta,%} or with the Vedic pro-
noun {%tva;%} never found at the beginning of a sentence
or verse, and causing the verb with which it is con-
structed to retain its accent). As a particle implying
‘earnest entreaty’ or ‘urgent request’ it is often used in
the Veda, like Lat. <nsi>dum,</nsi> with an imperative, and may
be translated by ‘pray!’ ‘I beg,’ ‘do’ (e. g. {%ā tveta,%}
come here, do); or it may be rendered by ‘well,’
‘now then,’ ‘now,’ ‘just.’ As an adversative particle
it is equivalent to ‘but,’ ‘on the contrary,’ ‘on the
other hand’ (e. g. {%na cchinati janayati tu,%} he
does not destroy but he produces). The sense ‘but’
is most common in later Sanskrit.
