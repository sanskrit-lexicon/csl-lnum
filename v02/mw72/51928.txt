{%—Sāma-veda, as,%} m., N. of one of the three prin-
cipal Vedas (see {%veda%}), or of the collective body of
sacred Mantras which constitute this Veda, (although
the word {%sāman%} is thought to be connected with rt.
{%śam,%} and {%soma%} is fr. another rt. [3. {%su%}], yet there
is a clear connection between this Veda and the
Soma ritual or moon-plant ceremonies; the princi-
pal part of its Mantras being specially arranged for
chanting by the Udgātṛ priests at such ceremonies,
[e. g. the Jyotiṣṭoma and its various stages of
Agniṣṭoma, Ukthya, &c.]; nevertheless it is really
a mere reproduction of parts of the Ṛg-veda trans-
posed and scattered about piecemeal, only 78 verses
in the whole Sāma-veda being, it is said, untraceable
to the present recension of the Ṛk: the Saṃhitā of
the Sāma-veda consists of two parts; the first, called
Ārcika [or Pūrvārcika or Chando-grantha], contains
585 verses disjoined from their proper sequence in
the Ṛg-veda and arranged in 59 Daśatis or decades,
which again are subdivided into Prapāṭhakas and
Ardha-prapāṭhakas; the second, called Staubhika [or
Uttarārcika or Uttarā-grantha], contains 1225 verses,
also chiefly from the Ṛk-saṃhitā, but less disjointed
than in the first part, and arranged in nine Prapāṭhakas
with Ardha-prapāṭhakas, mostly, however, grouped
in triplets, the first verse of which is also in the
[Page1107-c+ 81]
Ārcika, and thus appears twice in the Saṃhitā; this
verse is called the Yoni or womb, being, as it were,
a kind of parent of the two following verses, called
Uttarā, which are required to adapt themselves to
all the modulations and modifications observed in
the intoning of this leading verse; directions for
these modulations being carefully laid down in the
Gānas or manuals for chanting, two of which, viz.
the Veya-gāna and Āraṇya-gāna, are a directory for
the Ārcika portion, and two, viz. the Ūha-gāna and
Ūhya-gāna, for the Staubhika, the supposed efficacy
of the hymns depending greatly on the right appli-
cation of these directions for their utterance; it has
been calculated that out of the aggregate of 1549
distinct verses remaining in the two divisions of the
Sāma-veda Saṃhitā after subtracting the repeated
verses, 190 are from the 1st Maṇḍala of the Ṛk,
9 from the 2nd, 40 from the 3rd, 23 from the 4th,
53 from the 5th, 77 from the 6th, 75 from the 7th,
355 from the 8th, 9 from the Vālakhilyas, 545
from the 9th, 95 from the 10th; there being also
12 verses from the Atharva-veda, and 4 from the
Vājasaneyi-saṃhitā or white Yajur-veda; it will be
observed that more verses are taken from the ninth
than from any other Maṇḍala of the Ṛk, the whole
of the 114 hymns of this ninth Maṇḍala being
especially devoted to the praise of the Soma plant,
and thence called Pāvamānyaḥ or ‘purificational,’
this plant being there not only personified as a
deity but described as primeval, immortal, all-pervad-
ing, all-powerful, lord of gods, and indeed the Su-
preme Being himself; it is remarkable that although
in Manu I. 23. the Sāma-veda is described as drawn
forth from the sun, yet in IV. 123, 124. its sound
is said to possess a kind of impurity, which, however,
Kullūka explains to be merely a semblance of im-
purity, the reason given for this defect being that
whereas the Ṛg-veda has the gods for its objects
and the Yajur-has men, the Sāma- has special refer-
ence to the Pitṛs or deceased ancestors [this relation-
ship implying, perhaps, a connection between the
Soma plant and the moon, as this plant was collected
by moonlight, and in the later mythology was
sometimes identified with the moon, the supposed
residence of the Pitṛs]; this Veda is said to possess
eight Brāhmaṇas, viz. the Prauḍha or large Brāh-
maṇa [= Pañca-viṃśa], the Ṣaḍviṃśa, the Sāma-
vidhi or Sāma-vidhāna, the Ārṣeya, the Devatā-
dhyāya, the Vaṃśa, the Saṃhitopaniṣad, and the
Upaniṣad [<nsi>sic</nsi>], which last is probably the same as
the Chāndogyopaniṣad of the Sāma-veda regarded
as a Brāhmaṇa, see {%chandoga-brāhmaṇa, brāh-%}
{%maṇa.%}) {%—Sāmaveda-cchalā,%} f., N. of a short work
(giving certain musical directions in the form of
modulations and intonations of letters or syllables for

seven chapters, viz. {%veya-cchalā, āraṇā-c°, ūha-c°,%}
