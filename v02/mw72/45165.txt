{#vESezika#}¦ {%vaiśeṣika, as, ī, am%} (fr. {%viśeṣa%}),
characteristic; belonging to the Vaiśeṣika doctrine,
(in this sense fr. {%vaiśeṣika, am,%} n.); ({%as%}), m.
a follower of the Vaiśeṣika doctrine; ({%am%}), n.,
N. of one of the two great divisions of the
Nyāya school of philosophy founded by Kaṇāda,
(it was probably a later development of the other
great division or ‘Nyāya proper’ founded by Gau-
tama, with which it agrees in its analytical method
of treating the various subjects of inquiry, but from
which it differs in propounding only seven categories
or topics instead of sixteen; and more especially in
its doctrine of {%viśeṣa,%} ‘particularity or individual
essence,’ i. e. in its maintaining the eternally distinct
or <nsi>sui generis</nsi> nature of the nine substances, air, fire,
water, earth, mind, ether, time, space, and soul, of
which the first five, including mind, are held to be
atomic: the seven Padārthas or categories are,
1. Dravya, ‘substance,’ divided into nine, as above
stated; 2. Guṇa, ‘quality,’ of which there are twenty-
four [see {%guṇa%}]; 3. Karman, ‘action;’ 4. Sāmānya,
‘genus’ and ‘species;’ 5. Viśeṣa, ‘particularity,’
described above; 6. Samavāya, ‘co-inherence’ or
‘perpetual intimate connection;’ 7. A-bhāva, ‘non-
existence’ or ‘privation:’ Kaṇāda's system allows
only two of the Pramāṇas, i. e. instruments or means
of obtaining true knowledge, of the four admitted by
the Nyāya proper, viz. {%pratyakṣa%} or knowledge
[Page0971-a+ 76]
arising from contact of a sense with its object, and
{%anumāna,%} inference of three kinds [a priori, a pos-
teriori, and analogy], but the other Pramāṇas are
said by some to be contained in these two; the
system is taught in the form of Sūtras, and the
Vaiśeṣika-sūtras, like those of the Nyāya proper,
have been commented on by a triple set of com-
mentaries, and expounded in various works, of which
the best known are the Bhāṣā-pariccheda with its
commentary, called Siddhānta-muktāvalī, and the
Tarka-saṅgraha.) {%—Vaiśeṣika-sūtra, am,%} n. the
aphorisms of the Vaiśeṣika branch of the Nyāya
philosophy (attributed to Kaṇāda).
