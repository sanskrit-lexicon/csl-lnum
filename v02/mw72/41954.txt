envoy; a man of the third or Vaiśya tribe, a hus-
bandman, trader; ({%ikā%}), f. a sort of quail, (more
properly {%vārtikā;%} cf. {%vartaka%}); ({%am%}), n. an ex-
planatory or supplementary rule, critical gloss or
annotation (added to a grammatical or philosophical
Sūtra and defined to be ‘the exposition of the mean-
ing, of that which is said, of that which is left unsaid,
and of that which is ill or imperfectly said;’ the term
Vārttika is, however, especially applied to Kātyāya-
na's critical annotations on the aphorisms of Pāṇini's
grammar, the object of each Vārttika being to limit
a too general rule, amplify a too limited one, and
give the relations of the Sūtras of Pāṇini to each
other). {%—Vārttika-kāra, as,%} m. an epithet of Kā-
tyāyana as the author of the Vārttikas to Pāṇini's
grammatical aphorisms; of Kumārila.
