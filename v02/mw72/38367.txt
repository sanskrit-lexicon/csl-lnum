if, in case that; whether; if haply, if perchance; pro-
vided that, when. As a conjunction meaning ‘if,’
{%yadi%} is sometimes joined with the present indicative

will behold prosperity); sometimes with the poten-
tial (e. g. {%yadi rājā daṇḍaṃ na praṇayet,%} if the
king were not to inflict punishment; or with omis-
sion of {%yadi,%} e. g. {%vṛko hanyād ajām,%} if a wolf
should kill a goat); sometimes with the future (e. g.
{%yadi na kariṣyanti tat,%} if they will not do that);
sometimes with the aorist or even imperfect or perfect

the Creator had not created the body; {%yady etan%}
{%na me 'kathayat,%} if he were not to tell me that;
{%yady āha,%} if he had said); sometimes with the con-

expect that they are alive); rarely {%yadi%} is joined
redundantly with {%ced%} (e. g. {%yadi cet syāt,%} if it
should be); or with {%purā%} (e. g. {%purā yadi paśyāmi,%}
before that I see); {%yady-api,%} even if, although,

lative clause); {%yadi vā,%} or if, or whether; or else, or;
or rather {%(= atha vā); yadi — yadi vā, yadi vā — %}
{%yadi vā, yadi vā — vā,%} if — or if, whether — or.
