{#kva#}¦ {%kva,%} ind. (fr. 1. {%ku;%} according to Pāṇ.
V. 3, 12, VII. 2, 104, formed first fr. {%kim%} and then
fr. the substitute {%ku%} with affix {%at%}), where? in what
place? whither? how? when? (rarely) how much
less! [cf. {%kutas%}]; connected with the particles {%id,%}
{%svid, nu,%} &c., in the same manner as 2. {%ka,%} q. v.
(e. g. {%kva nu te kṣatriyāḥ śūrāḥ,%} where now are
those Kṣatriya heroes ?); {%kva%} appears to be used as
a loc. of 2. {%ka%} in Manu X. 66. (e. g. {%kva śreyas-%}
{%tvam,%} in whom is the preference?); {%kva%} with {%bhū,%}
{%as,%} or {%gata,%} may denote, how is it with? what has
become of? (e. g. {%kva aham bhavāni,%} what will
become of me? {%kva gatas tava mayy anurāgaḥ,%}
what has become of your affection for me?), or {%kva%}
alone may have the same meaning (e. g. {%kva sukham,%}
where is happiness? i. e. there is no such thing as
happiness); {%kva — kva%} or {%kutra — kva%} implies ex-
cessive incongruity, where is this? where is that?
how distant is this from that, how little does this
agree with that (e. g. {%kva śūrya-prabhavo vaṃśaḥ%}
{%kva ca alpa-viṣayā matiḥ,%} how can my limited
intellect describe the solar race?); {%kvāpi (kva api),%}
