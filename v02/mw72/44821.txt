Bhaṭṭa-nārāyaṇa (the subject of which is an incident
described in the Sabhā-parvan of the Mahā-bhārata,
2229-2235, where it is narrated that after Yudhi-
ṣṭhira had lost all his property, including Draupadī,
to Duryodhana in gambling with dice, she was treated
with great indignity by Duḥśāsana, who dragged her
by her braided hair into the public assembly; Bhīma,
who witnessed this insult, swore that in revenge he
would one day dash Duḥśāsana to pieces and drink
his blood — a threat which he fulfilled; this drama is
said to be also called {%Veṇī-saṃvaraṇa,%} perhaps for
{%°-saṃharaṇa%}).
