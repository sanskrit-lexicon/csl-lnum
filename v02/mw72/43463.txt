of Rāvaṇa, (his other brothers were Kuvera [by a
different mother] and Kumbha-karṇa; both Rāvaṇa
and Vibhīṣaṇa are said to have propitiated Brahmā
by their penances, so that the god granted them
both boons, and the boon chosen by Vibhīṣaṇa
was that he should never, even in the greatest cala-
mity, stoop to any mean or wicked action; hence
he is represented in the Rāmāyaṇa as opposing and
endeavouring to counteract the malice of his brother
Rāvaṇa, in consequence of which he was so ill-
treated and insulted by Rāvaṇa that, leaving Laṅkā,
he joined the side of Rāma, by whom, after the
death of Rāvaṇa, Vibhīṣaṇa was placed on the
throne of Laṅkā); N. of several kings, (in later
times Vibhīṣaṇa appears to have been used as a
general name of the kings of Laṅkā.) {%—Vibhīṣaṇa-%}
