{#cArvAka#}¦ {%cārvāka, as,%} m. (fr. {%cāru + vāka%}),
N. of a Rākṣasa described in the Mahā-bh. Śānti-
parva 1414, &c., as a friend of Duryodhana and an
enemy of the Pāṇḍavas; (having taken the shape of
a mendicant Brāhman, when Yudhiṣṭhira entered
Hāstina-pura in triumph, he reviled him and the
assembled Brāhmans, but was soon detected; and
the real Brāhmans, filled with fury, killed him on the
spot); N. of a sophistical philosopher who probably
lived before the composition of the Rāmāyaṇa; see
{%jāvāli.%} He was a sceptic in matters of Hindū
faith, and considered by the orthodox as an atheist
or materialist; according to some, the sceptical
doctrines of the Indian materialists were handed
down to Cārvāka and his followers by Vācas-pati
or Bṛhaspati, and the aphorisms of Bṛhaspati
(Bārhaspatya sūtras) are said to embody their
opinions; ({%as, ī, am%}), derived from or composed by
Cārvāka. {%—Cārvāka-darśana, am,%} n. the doctrine
of Cārvāka.
