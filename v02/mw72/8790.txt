{#AprI#}¦ {%ā-prī,%} f. (fr. rt. {%prī%} with {%ā%}), Ved.
gaining one's favour, conciliation, propitiation; ({%ā-pri-%}
{%yas%}), propitiatory verses; N. of certain invocations
addressed to a series of deified objects in order, and
said to be introductory to the animal sacrifice. Accord-
ing to others, the objects propitiated by these hymns
are the real āprīs or {%āpriyas;%} whence the hymns
themselves are called {%āprī%} hymns. The objects in-
voked are in a series of twelve verses, as follows:
1. Su-samiddha (or the fuel); 2. and 3. Tanūnapāt
and Narāśaṃsa (these are sometimes invoked in one
verse as mystic names of fire); 4. The divine being
who bears the invocations to the gods (see under {%iḍ%});
5. Barhis (or the sacred grass); 6. The doors of the
chambers in which the sacrifice is offered; 7. Night
and dawn; 8. The two divine beings, sometimes
called Pracetasas, who preside over and protect the
sacrificial rite; 9. The three goddesses, Ilā (see under
{%iḍā%}), Sarasvatī (goddess of eloquence), and Mahī (a
form of Bhāratī or speech); 10. Tvaṣṭṛ (the maker
or creator); 11. Vanas-pati (the tree or wooden column
to which the victim is tied); 12. Svāhā (the exclama-
tion used in inviting the gods to the sacrifice when
finally offered in the fire). All these are by Sāy. re-
garded as forms of Agni. See Ṛg-veda I. 13.
