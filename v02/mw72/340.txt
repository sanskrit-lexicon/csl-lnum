{%Aṅgira, as,%}¦ or usually {%aṅgiras, ās,%} m. (related to
<lang n="greek">ἄγγελος</lang> or <lang n="greek">ἄγγαρος</lang> ?), a celebrated mythological name,
usually ascribed to a Ṛṣi, the author of a number of
hymns in the Ṛg-veda, of a code of laws, and of a
treatise on astronomy; he is said by some to have
been born from Brahmā's mouth, and to have been
the husband of Smṛti, of Śraddhā, of two daughters
of Maitreya, of several daughters of Dakṣa, &c.; he
is considered as one of the seven Ṛṣis of the first
Manvantara, as a Prajāpati, as a teacher of the Brahma-
vidyā, which he had learnt from Satyavāha, a descend-
ant of Bharadvāja, &c. Among his sons, the chief is
Agni, others are Saṃvarta, Utathya, and Bṛhaspati;
among his daughters are mentioned Sinīvālī, Kuhū,
Rākā, and Anumati; but the Ṛcas (or Vedic hymns),
the manes of Haviṣmat, and mankind itself are
styled his offspring. In astronomy he is the planet
Jupiter, and a star in Ursa Major. ({%asas%}), m. pl. de-
scendants of Aṅgiras or of Agni, mostly personifications
