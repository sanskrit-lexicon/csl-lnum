{#Bos#}¦ {%bhos%} (contracted fr. {%bhavas%} for {%bha-%}
{%van,%} Sir! voc. sing. of 2. {%bhavat,%} q. v.; cf. {%bhagos%}
under {%bhaga-vat,%} p. 696, col. 1), an interjection or
vocative particle commonly used in addressing another
person and generally translateable by ‘O!’ ‘Ho!’
‘there!’ ‘Hallo!’ ‘Ah!’ ‘Alas!’ (before vowels and
soft consonants {%bhos,%} like {%bhagos%} and {%aghos,%} is said
to drop the final {%s,%} but before vowels {%bhoy%} is also
allowed, see Pāṇ. VIII. 3, 17, 18, 20, 22, Vopa-
deva II. 49, 50; before hard consonants, {%bhos%} or
{%bhoḥ%} is the form required, and {%bhoḥ%} before a
pause, but in the later literature {%bho%} is sometimes
used where {%bhos%} or {%bhoḥ%} would be more correct;
in Kathā-sarit-sāgara XVIII. 211, {%bhor iti%} is against
the rule; in Hari-vaṃśa 8301 {%bhos%} occurs in the middle
of a sentence, and in Bhāgavata-Purāṇa III. 23, 2,
redundantly at the end; it is sometimes repeated,
e. g. {%bho bho rājan%} in Śakuntalā, p. 12; according
to lexicographers it may be used as an interjection
of sorrow and of interrogation.)
