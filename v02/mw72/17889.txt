{#Ga#} 2¦. {%gha,%} ind. (a particle used to lay stress
on a word), at least, surely, verily, indeed, (cor-
responding to the Gr. <lang n="greek">γε.</lang>) This word occurs often
in the Ṛg-veda, elsewhere rarely; the final vowel is
generally lengthened in the Saṃhitā, but the original
form given in the Pada-pāṭha is always {%gha;%} it is
connected with other particles (as {%cid, uta, id%}), and
appears often after pronouns at the beginning of a
Pāda, after prepositions, and after the negative
particle {%na.%} Frequently this particle occurs in the
clause which depends on a conditional or relative
sentence (e. g. {%ā ghā gamad yadi śravat,%} he will
surely come when he hears).
