{#ena#}¦ {%ena,%} a pronom. base (used for certain
cases of the 3rd personal pronoun, and occurring only
in the acc. sing. du. pl. ({%enam, enām, enad,%} &c.),
inst. sing. ({%enena, enayā%}), gen. loc. du. ({%enayos,%} Ved.
{%enos%}); the other cases are formed fr. the pronom.
base {%a,%} see under {%idam%}), he, she, it; this, that.
This pronoun is enclitic and cannot begin a sentence.
It is generally used alone, so that {%enam puruṣam,%}
‘that man,’ would be very unusual if not incorrect.
Grammarians assert that the substitution of {%enam%}
for {%imam%} or {%etam%} takes place in case of the re-em-
ployment of these pronouns in the subsequent part
of a sentence; see Gram. 836; [cf. Gr. <lang n="greek">ἕν, οἶος</lang>
Goth. <nsi>ains;</nsi> Old Pruss. <nsi>ains;</nsi> Lat <nsi>oinos, unus.</nsi>]
