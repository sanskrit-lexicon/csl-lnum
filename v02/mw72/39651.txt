{%Rudra, as, ā, am%}¦ (according to Uṇādi-s. II. 22.
fr. rt. 1. {%rud%} above; according to others fr. rt. 1. {%ru%}
{%+ dra%} fr. rt. 2. {%dru,%} to run; connected with {%rodas,%}
q. v., and perhaps with {%rudhira%}), crying, howling,
roaring, one who cries or roars, dreadful, horrible,
terrific, awful; great, large; (according to the fanciful
etymologies of native writers, the following meanings
are also assigned to this word), driving away evil;
running about and roaring; praiseworthy, to be
praised, (according to Naigh. III. 16) {%= stotṛ,%} a
praiser, panegyrist, worshipper; ({%as%}), m. ‘the Roarer’
or ‘Howler,’ N. of the god of tempests and father
of the Rudras or Maruts, (originally perhaps the
mere personified roaring of the storms, but as the
crackling or raging of fire may resemble the sound
of wind, so in the Veda the god of storms is some-
times identified with the god of fire; though gene-
rally represented as a destroying deity whose terrible
shafts bring death or disease on men and cattle, he
is also addressed as benevolent and auspicious [{%śiva%}],
and is even supposed to have a healing efficacy from
his chasing away vapours and purifying the atmo-
sphere; hence he has various epithets in the Veda,
such as ‘multiform,’ ‘terrible as a wild beast,’ ‘tawny-
coloured,’ ‘wearing braided hair’ [{%kapardin%}], ‘ce-
lestial boar,’ ‘armed with a strong bow and fleet
arrows,’ ‘cause of prosperity to man and beast,’ ‘pos-
sessor of healing remedies,’ ‘greatest of physicians,’
&c.; he is of course ruler of the Rudras, who are
the same as the storm winds, more usually called
Maruts, and who are often associated with Indra [see
{%marut%}]: in the later mythology the epithet {%śiva,%}
[Page0849-b+ 81]
‘propitious,’ which does not occur as <nsi>a name</nsi> in the
Veda, was employed as the real name of the destroy-
ing deity, being at first applied as an euphemism to
propitiate him: moreover the character of the deity
lost its special connection with storms, and developed
into a personification of the destroying principle
generally, though even the Epic and Purānic Śiva
was regarded as the generator as well as destroyer:
moreover a new class of beings, described as eleven
in number, though still called Rudras, took the
place of the original Rudras or Maruts: in the Veda
only three groupings of deities into classes appear to
be recognised, Indra belonging to the Vasus, Varuṇa
to the Ādityas, and Rudra to the Rudras or Maruts;
but in Manu XI. 221. the Maruts are enumerated
as a fourth group, being there distinguished from
the eleven Rudras: in Viṣṇu-Purāṇa I. 7. Rudra
is said to have sprung from Brahmā's forehead, and
to have afterwards separated himself into a figure
half male and half female, the former portion sepa-
rating again into the eleven Rudras, who were so
called because they ‘ran about crying aloud’ [{%ruda-%}
{%nād drāvaṇāc-ca,%} cf. rts. 1. {%rud,%} 2. {%dru%}]; hence
these later Rudras are sometimes regarded as inferior
manifestations of Śiva, and most of their names are
also names of Śiva; these names are variously given
in the different Purāṇas; those of the Vāyu are
Ajaikapād, Ahvi-bradhna, Hara, Nir-ṛta, Īśvara,
Bhuvana, Aṅgāraka, Ardha-ketu, Mṛtyu, Sarpa,
Kapālin: according to other accounts the Rudras are
represented as children of Kaśyapa and Surabhī or of
Brahmā and Surabhī or of Bhūta and Su-rūpā); a
form or manifestation or N. of Śiva (in the later
mythology, as explained above; according to the
Viṣṇu-Purāṇa I. 8. Rudra is one of the eight forms
of Śiva; he is elsewhere reckoned among the Dik-
pālas as regent of the north-east quarter); a symbo-
lical expression for the number eleven (from the
eleven Rudras, see above); a mystical epithet of
the letter {%e;%} Calotropis Gigantea; N. of various
persons; of a lexicographer; of a poet; of a king;
