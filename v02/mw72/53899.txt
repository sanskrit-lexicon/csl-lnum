‘having (large) jaws,’ N. of a monkey-chief (one of
the most celebrated of a vast host of semi-divine
apes or monkey-like beings, who, according to Rāmā-
yaṇa I. 16, were created to become the allies of
Rāma-candra in his war with Rāvaṇa; the chiefs of
these Simian armies were supposed to be the progeny
of various gods; thus, Su-grīva, q. v., was son of the
Sun, Bāli of Indra, Tāra of Vṛhas-pati, Gandha-
mādana of Kuvera, Nala of Viśva-karman, Nīla of
Agni, Su-ṣeṇa of Varuṇa, and the celebrated Hanu-
mat of Pavana or Māruta, ‘the Wind;’ their character
corresponds more to that of Genii than animals;
they are all described as capable of supernatural feats,
and Hanumat especially is fabled to have assumed
any form at will, wielded rocks, removed mountains,
mounted the air, seized the clouds, and rivalled
Garuḍa in swiftness of flight; according to other
legends, Hanumat was son of Śiva; his mother's
name was Añjanā, q. v.); a particular sort of monkey,
Simia Sinica. {%—Hanuman-nāṭaka, am,%} n. the

supposed to have been written about the tenth or
eleventh century of our era, and ascribed to Hanumat
himself, who is said to have engraved it on rocks;
it is emphatically called the Mahā-nāṭaka or great
drama, and is, in fact, the story of the Rāmāyaṇa
dramatized, the monkey-chief Hanumat playing a
very important part in the action of the piece).
