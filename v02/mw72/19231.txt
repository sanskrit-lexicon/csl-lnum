{%Jaṭāyu, us,%}¦ and {%jaṭāyus, us,%} m., N. of a fabulous
bird, the king of the vultures ({%gṛdhra-rāja%}), son
of Aruṇa and Śyenī (or according to the Rāmāyaṇa,
son of Garuḍa), and younger brother of Sampāti.
(It is related in Chap. XX of the Araṇya-kāṇḍa of
the Rāmāyaṇa, that whilst Rāma was on his way to
Pañcavatī he met Jaṭāyus, who declared his intention
of aiding Rāma, out of regard for his father Daśa-
ratha. Accordingly when Rāvaṇa carried off Sītā,
the semi-divine bird attempted to rescue her, but
was defeated and mortally wounded by Rāvaṇa;
Chap. LVI); bdellium, see {%guggulu;%} N. of a
mountain.
