{#katama#}¦ {%katama, as, ā, at%} (superlative of 2. {%ka;%}
declined as a pronom., Gram. 236), who or which of
many ? (e. g. {%katamena pathā yātās te,%} by which
road have they gone?). {%Katama%} is often a mere
strengthened substitute for {%ka,%} the superlative affix
imparting emphasis. Hence it may occasionally be
used for ‘who or which of two?’ (e. g. {%tayoḥ kata-%}
{%masmai,%} to which of these two ?). It may option-
ally be compounded with the word to which it refers
(e. g. {%katamaḥ Kaṭhaḥ%} or {%katama-kaṭhaḥ,%} which
Kaṭha out of many?). When followed by {%ca%} and
preceded by {%yatama%} an indefinite expression is
formed equivalent to ‘any whosoever,’ ‘any whatso-
ever,’ &c. (e. g. {%yatamad eva katamac ca vidyāt,%}
he may know anything whatsoever). In negative
sentences {%katama%} with {%cana%} or {%katama%} with {%api%}
= not even one, none at all (e. g. {%na katamac-%}
{%canāhaḥ,%} not even on a single day, on no day at
all). In addition to the above uses {%katama%} is said to
mean ‘best,’ ‘excessively good-looking;’ [cf. 3. {%ka.%}]
{%—Katamoraga (°ma-ur°), as,%} m., N. of a man.
