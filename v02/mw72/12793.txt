{#eva#} 2¦. {%eva, as, ā, am%} (fr. rt. 5. {%i%}), Ved. going,
moving, speedy, quick; ({%as%}), m. a course, way, (often
in inst. pl., e. g. {%sanād divam pari bhumā svebhir%}
{%evair aktoṣā carataḥ,%} from all eternity day and
night move round heaven and earth in their accus-
tomed course); earth, world?; (Sāy.) a courser, a
[Page0186-c+ 78]
fleet horse; ({%ās%}), m. pl. way or manner of acting,
mode of proceeding, custom, usage, habit; (Sāy.)
desire, a hymn which goes or is directed to the
object of praise (e. g. {%abhi caṣṭe sūro arya evān,%}
the sun sees into the conduct of the worshipper; or
according to Sāy. the sun being a lord makes mani-
fest or grants desires). When the inst. c. is used, the
meaning is hardly to be distinguished from that in
the first example (e. g. {%svair evaiḥ,%} in his usual way
of proceeding; {%pūrvyebhir evaiḥ,%} in the ancient
mode; or according to Sāy. with ancient hymns).
{%—Eva-yā, ās, ās, am,%} Ved. going in ways or
courses, i. e. either going quickly or going the usual
way; epithet of Viṣṇu; (Sāy.) granting protection.
{%—Evayā-marut,%} Ved., (Sāy.) N. of the author of
a Ṛg-veda hymn, but perhaps rather an exclamation
meaning either {%eva-yā,%} i. e. ‘Viṣṇu (cf. the pre-
ceding word) and the Maruts!’ or ‘moving Maruts.’
{%—Eva-yāvan, ā, ā, a,%} Ved. going quickly, or going
the usual way; epithet of Viṣṇu and of the Maruts;
(Sāy.) going with horses; granting desires.
