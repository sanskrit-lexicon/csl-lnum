{#iti#} 2¦. {%iti,%} ind. (fr. pronominal base 3. {%i%}),
in this manner, thus. In its original signification {%iti%}
refers to something that has been said or thought, or
lays stress on what precedes. In the Brāhmaṇas it is
often equivalent to ‘as you know,’ reminding the
hearer or reader of certain customs, conditions, &c.,
supposed to be known to him.
[Page0139-a+ 75]
<div n="P"/>In quotations of every kind {%iti%} means that the pre-
ceding words are the very words which some person
has or might have spoken, and placed thus at the end
of a speech it serves the purpose of inverted commas
(e. g. {%ity uktvā,%} having so said; {%iti kṛtvā,%} having so
considered, having so decided). It may often have
reference merely to what is passing in the mind, e. g.
{%bālo'pi nāvamantavyo manuṣya iti bhūmipaḥ,%}
a king, though a child, is not to be despised, saying
to one's self, ‘he is a mortal,’ (Gram. 928.) In
theatrical language {%iti tathā karoti%} = after these
words he acts so.
<div n="P"/>Sometimes {%iti%} is used to include under one head
a number of separate objects aggregated together
(e. g. {%ijyādhyayanadānāni tapaḥ satyaṃ kṣamā%}
{%damaḥ alobha iti mārgo'yam,%} ‘sacrificing, study-
ing, liberality, penance, truth, patience, self-restraint,
absence of desire,’ this course of conduct, &c.).
