{#ca#} 2¦. {%ca,%} ind. (a particle and conjunction
usually translateable by) and, both, also, moreover,
as well as. This conjunction, like the Lat. <nsi>que</nsi> and
Gr. <lang n="greek">τε,</lang> is usually placed as an enclitic after the word
which it connects with what precedes, and when used
with the personal pronouns these must appear in
their fuller accented forms (e. g. {%tava ca mama ca,%}
both of thee and of me, not {%te ca me ca%}). It con-
nects whole sentences as well as parts of sentences,
and seems to have been originally placed after both
the words or clauses which it joins together, for in
the Ṛg-veda the double {%ca%} occurs much more fre-
quently than the single (e. g. {%ahaṃ ca tvaṃ ca,%}
I and thou). The double {%ca%} may also be used
somewhat redundantly in classical Sanskrit (e. g. {%kva%}
{%hariṇakānāṃ jīvitaṃ cātilolaṃ kva ca vajra-%}
{%sārāḥ śarās te,%} where is both the frail existence of
fawns and where are thy adamantine arrows ?). In the
later literature, however, the first {%ca%} is more usually
omitted (e. g. {%ahaṃ tvaṃ ca%}), and when more than
two things are enumerated only one {%ca%} is often found
(e. g. {%tejasā yaśasā lakṣmyā sthityā ca parayā,%}
in glory, in fame, in beauty, and in high condition).
Elsewhere, when more than two things are enume-
rated, {%ca%} is placed after some and omitted after others
(e. g. {%ṛṇa-dātā ca vaidyaśca śrotriyo nadī,%} both
the payer of a debt and a physician [and] a Brāhman
[and] a river). In the Veda and even in classical
Sanskrit, when the double {%ca%} would generally be
used, the second may occasionally be omitted (e. g.
{%Indraśca Somaḥ,%} both Indra [and] Soma; {%dur-%}
{%bhedyaśca āśu-sandheyaḥ,%} both difficult to be
divided [and] quickly to be united). Rarely {%ca%} may
imply a reference to certain other words which are
not expressed (e. g. {%kamaṇḍalau ca karakaḥ,%} the
word {%karaka%} has the meaning ‘pitcher’ and other
meanings).
