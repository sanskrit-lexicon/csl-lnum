nymic, N. of the author of the Nirukta or commen-
tary on the difficult Vedic words contained in the
lists called Nighaṇṭus, (these consist of three divisions,
1. the Naighaṇṭuka or a list of synonymous words,
2. the Naigama or words usually occurring in the
Veda only, 3. the Daivata or words relating to deities
and sacrificial acts; according to some, these three
lists were drawn up by Yāska himself, and then com-
mented on in his Nirukta, which quotes Vedic pas-
sages in illustration of the words, and is the oldest
Vedic commentary extant; Yāska is supposed to
have lived before Pāṇini); ({%ās%}), m. pl. the pupils of
Yaska.
