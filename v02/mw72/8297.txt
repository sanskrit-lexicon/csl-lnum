{#At#}¦ {%āt,%} ind. (fr. 4. {%a%}), Ved. afterwards,
then; (in which senses it is often used in a concluding
paragraph antithetically to {%yad, yadā, yadi,%} being
then sometimes strengthened by the particles {%aha, id,%}
{%īm, u;%} e. g. {%yaded ayukta haritaḥ sadhasthād%}
{%ād rātrī vāsas tanute simasmai,%} ‘at the very time
when he has unyoked his coursers from his car, then
[Page0117-a+ 76]
night extends the veiling darkness over all;’ {%Vṛtraṃ%}
{%yad Indra śavasāvadhīr ahim ād it sūryaṃ%}
{%divy ārohayo dṛśe,%} ‘when, O Indra, thou didst slay
with thy power the dragon Vṛtra, then indeed thou
didst raise the sun in the sky, that it might be seen.’
In other passages {%āt%} is simply used like a conjunc-
tion, equivalent to ‘then, further, also, and.’ Sometimes
it only serves to strengthen the meaning of another
word, or to give emphasis to an interrogative pronoun,
in the same way as {%u, nu, aṅga,%} &c.; e. g. {%ya eka%}
{%id apratir manyamāna ād asmād anyo aja-%}
{%niṣṭa tavyān,%} ‘he who considered himself alone
irresistible, another was born mightier even than he;’
{%Kim āt pra bravāma,%} ‘How can we at all pro-
claim ?’
