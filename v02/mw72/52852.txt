{%a,%} n., N. of the tenth book of the Mahā-bhārata
(in which is described how the three surviving Kuru
warriors, Aśvatthāman, Kṛta-varman, and Kṛpa,
after the destruction of their army, determined on
attacking the camp of the Pāṇḍavas by night and
murdering them while asleep; this they accordingly
did, Aśvatthāman entering the camp stealthily and,
with the assistance of the god Śiva, slaughtering
thousands, while the two others stood at the gate
and killed all who attempted to escape; the whole
Pāṇḍava army was thus destroyed, except the five
Pāṇḍu princes themselves, with Kṛṣṇa and Sātyaki,
who were stationed at some distance from the camp;
a messenger having escaped conveyed the news to
Yudhi-ṣṭhira, who, with his brothers and Draupadī,
then returned to the camp and bewailed their
slaughtered kindred).
