mountains of Nepal, his father, Śuddhodana, of the
family of the Śākyas, being the king of that country,
and his mother, Māyādevī, being the daughter of
king Su-prabuddha; hence he belonged to the
Kṣatriya caste, and his name Śākya was really his
family name, while that of Gautama was taken from
the class or race to which his family belonged; his
other names of Buddha, ‘enlightened,’ and Siddhārtha,
‘one whose objects have been effected,’ being pro-
bably given at a later period; he is said to have
entered on his mission in the district of Magadha or
Behār about the year 588 B. C. and to have died at
Kuśi-nagara in Oude in the year 543 B. C.; there
have been twenty-four Buddhas of the past, Śākya-
muni or Gautama being only the last Buddha, i. e.
