{%gati%} is more comprehensive than {%upasarga,%} and is
applicable also when the verbal root becomes de-

the prepositions with {%su%} and {%dus,%} whereas the Gatis
include many other adverbial prefixes such as {%alam%}

&c. Lastly, prepositions are Karmapravacanīyas if they
are unconnected with verbs and govern a noun either
