{%Tmanā,%}¦ ind., Ved. Although according to the
unanimous interpretation of the native scholiasts
and grammarians (cf. Pāṇ. VI. 4, 141) this word
stands for {%ātmanā,%} ‘by itself, myself, himself, one's
self,’ &c., yet it has evidently in many cases lost its
original meaning and is used as an emphatic particle
in the same way as the Greek <lang n="greek">μέν and μήν;</lang> it may
then be translated by ‘yet,’ ‘really,’ ‘indeed,’ ‘even,’
‘at least,’ ‘certainly,’ ‘also;’ ({%tmanā%} usually lays
stress on a preceding and more rarely on a following
word); {%uta tmanā, tmanā ca,%} and also, and cer-
tainly; {%iva tmanā%} or {%na tmanā,%} just as; {%adha%}
{%tmanā,%} then certainly, even.
