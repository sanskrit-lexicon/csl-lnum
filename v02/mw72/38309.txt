{%Yajus, us,%}¦ n. religious reverence, veneration, wor-
ship, oblation, sacrifice (Ved.); that by which a
sacrifice is effected, a sacrificial prayer or formula; a
text of the Yajur-veda or rather a technical term for
certain words or Mantras muttered in a peculiar
manner at a sacrifice, (these Mantras were properly
in prose as distinguished from the metrical {%ṛc%} which
was recited, and the metrical {%sāman%} which was
sung, see {%mantra,%} 2. {%ṛc;%} although, however, the
prose Yajus is a distinctive feature of the Yajur-veda,
this Veda is in real fact chiefly composed of verses
taken from the Ṛg-veda, which may then also be
called Yajus, cf. {%Yajur-veda%} below); N. of the
Yajur-veda, q. v., (in this sense also frequently {%ya-%}
{%jūṃṣi,%} n. pl.); ({%us%}), m., N. of a man. {%—Yajuḥ-%}
{%śākhin, ī, inī, i,%} familiar with a Śākhā of the
Yajur-veda. {%—Yajur-maya, as, ī, am,%} consisting of
verses of the Yajur-veda; [cf. {%ṛṅ-maya.%}] {%—Yajur-%}
{%lakṣmī, īs,%} f., N. of a particular formula. {%—Yajur-%}
{%vid, t, t, t,%} knowing the Yajus, conversant with
sacrificial formulas, one who is familiar with the
Yajur-veda. {%—Yajur-vidhāna, am,%} n., N. of a work.
{%—Yajur-veda, as,%} m. ‘the sacrificial Veda,’ the
collective body of sacred Mantras or texts which con-
stitute the Yajur-veda, (these Mantras, though often
consisting of the prose Yajus, are frequently identical
with the Mantras of the Ṛg-veda, the Yajur-veda
being only a collection of liturgical forms or rather a
sort of sacrificial prayer-book for the Adhvaryu priests
formed out of the Ṛg-veda, which had to be dissected
and re-arranged with additional texts for sacrificial
purposes; to serve these purposes, the hymns of the
Ṛg-veda are scattered about piecemeal, verses of the
same hymn being often transposed, verses from dif-
ferent hymns combined, and even those of different
poets brought together into one and the same hymn;
in fact the compilation of the Yajur-veda resulted
from the gradual growth of a complicated ritual in
connection with those sacrifices without which the
Hindū believed it was impossible to secure the favour
of his gods, and for the performance of which the
unsystematic collection of hymns in the Ṛg-veda
was unsuited: the great characteristic feature of the
Yajur-veda is its division into two distinct collections
of texts, the one called Taittirīya-saṃhitā or Kṛṣṇa,
i. e. ‘Black’ [because in it the Saṃhitā or simple
collection of texts and Brāhmaṇa or explanation of
the rites in which the texts were employed is con-
[Page0802-c+ 80]
fused]; the other called Vājasaneyi-saṃhitā or Śukla,
i. e. ‘White’ [because in this, which is thought to be
the more recent of the two recensions, the Saṃhitā is
cleared from confusion with its Brāhmaṇa, and there-
fore looks white and orderly]: the order of sacrifices,
however, of both divisions of the Yajur-veda is simi-
lar, two of the principal being the Darśa-pūrṇa-māsa
or sacrifice to be performed at new and full moon, and
the Aśva-medha or horse-sacrifice; cf. {%Taittirīya-%}
{%saṃhitā, Vājasaneyi-saṃhitā.%}) {%—Yajurveda-%}
