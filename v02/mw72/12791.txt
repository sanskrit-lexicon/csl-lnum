{%Eva%}¦ may often be connected with other adverbs
in the sense of ‘also,’ ‘likewise,’ &c., as in the fol-
lowing examples: {%tathaiva,%} so also; {%tathaiva%}
{%ca,%} and so likewise; {%eva ca,%} and also; {%caiva,%} and
also; {%eva vā,%} or also; {%na tv eva,%} but not also.
Grammarians assert that {%eva%} cuts off the final of {%kva%}
when it follows that adverb, as {%kv-eva,%} where pos-
sibly ? i. e. nowhere. Lexicographers affirm that
{%eva%} may imply emphasis, affirmation, detraction,
diminution, command, restraint; or be used as an
expletive; [cf. Goth. <nsi>aiv,</nsi> Them. <nsi>aiva;</nsi> Old Germ.
