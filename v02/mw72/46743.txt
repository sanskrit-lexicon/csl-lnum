{#Siva#}¦ {%śiva, as, ā, am%} (according to Uṇādi-s.
I. 153. fr. rt. 1. {%śī;%} more probably to be connected
with rt. {%śvi%} and {%śavas,%} see {%śiśvi%}), auspicious, pro-
pitious, prosperous, happy, fortunate, lucky, increas-
ing, thriving, right; ({%as%}), m., N. of the third god
of the Hindū Tri-mūrti, (in the later mythology
regarded as ‘the destroyer,’ and with Brahmā, ‘the
creator,’ and Viṣṇu, ‘the preserver,’ constituting
the well known Hindū triad of divine manifestations;
although the name Śiva is not found applied to any
god in the Veda, the worship of the destroying and
reproducing principle under this name was rapidly
developed in the Purāṇas and epic poems, and be-
came very general in later times, the worshippers of
Śiva or Śaivas assigning to him the first place in the
triad and by identifying him with the principles of
creation and reproduction as well as that of destruc-
tion, constituting him the one Supreme Being who
is supposed to comprehend all the powers and forces
of nature and whose formidable character makes him
the first object of propitiation and adoration; in the
Śiva-Purāṇa he is addressed as Brahmā, Viṣṇu,
Indra, Varuṇa, the Sun, Moon, Earth, Fire, Water,
Air, Ether, &c., while even in the Viṣṇu and other
Purāṇas not specially devoted to his praise, he is
mentioned with the greatest reverence and awe;
according to one view the name Śiva belonged
originally to the principal god of the aboriginal
tribes of India, and being subsequently adopted
together with the Liṅga or symbol of reproduction
into the Pantheon of the Āryans, was then identified
with their own deity Rudra, who occupies a con-
spicuous position in the Veda as god of storms; but
according to a more likely supposition the adjective
{%śiva,%} ‘auspicious,’ being at first only used as an
euphemistic epithet to propitiate the lord of tempests,
passed afterwards into his name, and was ultimately
adopted as the principal name of the god of destruc-
tion, [see {%rudra%}]; according to Viṣṇu-Purāṇa I. 8.
there are eight principal manifestations of Śiva, viz.
Rudra, Bhava, Śarva, Iśāna, Paśu-pati, Bhīma, Ugra,
Mahā-deva, which again are visibly represented under
eight Tanus or material forms, viz. the Sun, Water,
Earth, Air, Fire, Ether, the officiating Brahman,
and the Moon, Śiva being supposed to uphold the
universe by means of these forms; as presiding over
reproduction, which follows destruction, his symbol
is the Liṅga or Phallus, under which form he is
generally worshipped at the present day; as god of
justice or punishment, which character he shares with
the gods Yama and Varuṇa, he is represented as
riding on a white bull, the god Dharma, it is said,
having taken this form and requested Śiva to accept
him as his vehicle; his own colour is sometimes
depicted as black in his character of destroyer of the
world, when he is called Kāla or Time; again, one
of his representations is as Ardha-nārī, ‘half-female,’
the other half being male to symbolize the unity of
the generative principle, his name being then Ardha-
nārīśa, ‘the half-female lord;’ he has sometimes five
faces, whence his name Pāñcānana; he has also three
[Page1007-c+ 81]
eyes, one of which is in his forehead, and which are
thought to denote his view of the three divisions of
time, past, present, and future, while a moon's
crescent, round or above the central eye, marks the
measure of time by months, a serpent round his
neck the measure of time by years, and a second
necklace of skulls with numerous other serpents about
his person, the perpetual revolution of ages, and the
successive extinction and generation of the races of
mankind: his hair is thickly matted together, and
gathered above his forehead into a coil, so as to
project like a horn; on the top of it he bears the
Ganges, the rush of which river in its descent form
heaven he intercepted by his head that the earth
might not be crushed by the weight of the falling
stream; his throat is dark-blue from the stain of the
deadly poison which would have destroyed the world
had it not been swallowed by him on its production
at the churning of the ocean by the gods for the
nectar of immortality: he is sometimes represented
clothed in a deer-skin, sometimes in a tiger-skin, or
he appears sitting on a tiger-skin or holding a deer
in one of his hands; in explanation of this a legend
is told that Śiva, having once visited a forest in the
form of a religious mendicant, the wives of the
Ṛṣis residing there fell in love with his great
beauty, which the Ṛṣis perceiving resented; in
order, therefore, to overpower him, they first dug a
pit, and by magical arts caused a tiger to rush out of
it, which he slew, and taking its skin wore it as a
garment; they next caused a deer to spring out upon
him, which he took up in his left hand and ever
afterwards retained there; they then produced a red-
hot iron, but this too he took up and kept in his
hand as a weapon: sometimes, again, he appears
wearing an elephant's skin which belonged to an
Asura named Gaya, who acquired such power that
he conquered the gods and would have destroyed the
Munis had they not fled to Benares and taken
refuge in a temple of Śiva, who then destroyed the
Asura and, ripping up his body, stripped off the hide
which he afterwards cast over his shoulders for a
cloak: Śiva holds a {%triśūla%} or three-pronged trident
[also called Pināka] in his hand to denote, as some
think, his combination of the three attributes of
Creator, Destroyer, and Regenerator; his other
weapons are a bow called Ajakava or Ajagava, a
thunderbolt, an axe, a kind of staff with transverse
pieces surmounted by a skull called Khaṭvāṅga, and
another nondescript weapon called Khiṅkira; he also
carries a kind of rattle or drum, shaped like an hour-
glass, called Ḍamaru, and a Pāśa or noose for binding
incorrigible offenders: his attendants or servants are
called Pramatha; they are sometimes regarded as
demons or supernatural beings of various kinds, and
form a complete host; some of his more personal
attendants or chamberlains have special names, such
as Nandi or Nandin, Bhṛṅgin, Taṇḍu, the latter
being the original teacher of dancing &c., whence
Śiva is called Naṭeśvara, ‘the lord of dancers,’ and is
himself described as {%nāṭya-priya,%} fond of dancing:
his principal wife Durgā, otherwise called Pārvatī,
Umā, Gaurī, Bhavānī, Satī, &c., is the chief object
of worship with the Śāktas and Tāntrikas, see {%śakti,%}
{%śākta, tantra:%} his sons are Gaṇeśa and Kārttikeya:
he destroyed several Asuras or demons, such as Pura,
Tripura, Andhaka, Ruru; he also scorched the god
of love, Kāma-deva, to ashes by a glance from his
central eye, that deity having attempted to inflame
him with passion for Pārvatī whilst he was engaged
in severe penance; he is said to have cut off one of
the heads of the god Brahmā, that god having ori-
ginally possessed five heads, one of which is fabled
to have addressed Śiva on a particular occasion in a
disrespectful manner, cf. {%brahma-mūrdha-bhṛt;%}
he also decapitated Dakṣa and replaced his head by
that of a ram, because that sage, who was his father-
in-law, omitted to invite him and his wife Satī to a
great sacrifice at which all the other gods were
present, see {%dakṣādhvara-dhvaṃśa-kṛt;%} in the
exercise of his function of Universal Destroyer he
[Page1008-a+ 81]
destroys, at the end of every Kalpa, not only all
created beings, but even Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and the
other gods, whose bones and skulls he wears as gar-
lands; moreover, at the end of one of the early
Kalpas he is fabled to have burnt them up by a flash
from his central eye, and afterwards to have rubbed
their ashes upon his body, whence the use of ashes
is considered of great importance in his worship,
while the use of the Rudrākṣa berries or beads
originated, it is said, from the legend that Śiva, on
his way to destroy the three cities, called Tri-pura,
let fall some tears of rage which became converted
into these beads: his residence is Kailāsa, one of the
loftiest northern peaks of the Himālaya, which is
also the paradise of Kuvera: he has strictly no in-
carnations like those of Viṣṇu, though Vīra-bhadra
and the eight Bhairavas are sometimes regarded as
forms of him, sometimes as his sons, see {%vīra-bha-%}
{%dra, bhairava;%} he is especially worshipped at Be-
nares and has even more names than Viṣṇu, one
thousand and eight being specified in the sixty-ninth
chapter of the Śiva-Purāṇa and in the seventeenth
chapter of the Anuśāsana-parvan of the Mahā-bhā-
