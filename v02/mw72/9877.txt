abl.) different from; low, vile; expelled, rejected;
{%itara itara,%} the one — the other, this — that. ({%Itara%}
connected antithetically with a preceding word often
signifies the contrary idea, e. g. {%vijayāya itarāya%}
{%vā,%} to victory or defeat; so in Dvandva compounds,
{%sukhetareṣu,%} in happiness and distress. It some-
times, however, forms a Tat-puruṣa compound with
another word to express the one idea implied in the
contrary of that word, e. g. {%dakṣiṇetara,%} the left
hand.) {%—Itara-jana, ās,%} m. pl. other men; a euphe-
mistic title of certain beings who appear to be consi-
dered as spirits of darkness; Kuvera belongs to them.
{%—Itara-tas,%} ind. otherwise than, different from;
{%itaścetarataśca,%} hither and thither. {%—Itara-thā,%}
ind. in another manner, in a contrary manner; per-
versely; on the other hand, else.
