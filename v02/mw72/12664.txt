and Vāja, sons of Su-dhanvan, a descendant of
Aṅgiras, and called Ṛbhus from the name of the
elder. Through their performance of good works
[{%sv-apas%}] they obtained divinity, exercised super-
human powers, and became entitled to worship.]
They are supposed to dwell in the solar sphere, and
are the artists who formed the horses of Indra, the
carriage of the Aśvins, and the miraculous cow of
Bṛhaspati; they made their aged parents young, and
constructed four cups at a sacrifice from the one cup
of Tvaṣṭṛ who, as the proper artificer of the gods,
was in this respect their rival; they appear generally
as accompanying Indra, especially at the evening sacri-
fice. In later mythology {%Ṛbhu%} is a son of Brahmā);
a deity, a divinity in general; [cf. <lang n="greek">Ὀρφεύς.</lang>] {%—Ṛbhu-%}
