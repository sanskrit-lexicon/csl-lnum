ruptive, contaminating, a defiler; censorious, detract-
ing, a detractor, abuser; jocular, facetious, witty;

drama) the jocose companion and confidential friend
of the principal character or hero of the play, (this
character acts the same confidential part towards the
king or prince, who is the hero of the piece, that her
female companions do towards the heroine; he is
also the personage whose business is to excite mirth
by being ridiculous in person and attire, and by allow-
ing himself to become the universal butt of others;
a curious regulation requires him to be a Brāhman,
that is, of a caste higher than that of the king him-
self; see Śakuntalā, Act 2); a libertine, catamite.
