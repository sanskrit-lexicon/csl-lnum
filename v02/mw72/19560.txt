{%Jābāli, is,%}¦ m., N. of an ancient sage; also of the
author of a law-book; N. of an infidel Brāhman who
was one of the priests of king Daśa-ratha and after
his death tried ineffectually to shake the resolution
of Rāma and induce him to take the throne offered
to him by his dutiful younger brother Bharata; (his
speech, which is given in Rāmāyaṇa II. 108, con-
tains doctrines very similar to those of the Cārvākas
or materialists.)
