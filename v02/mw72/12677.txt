{#fzi#}¦ {%ṛṣi, is,%} m. (said to be either fr. rt.
{%dṛś,%} ‘to see,’ or fr. 1. {%ṛṣ;%} perhaps related to {%arc%}
or {%ṛc,%} ‘to praise’), a singer of sacred hymns, an in-
spired poet or sage, any person who alone or with
others invokes the deities in rhythmical speech or
song, especially in song of a sacred character (e. g. the
ancient hymn-singers Kutsa, Atri, Rebha, Agastya,
Kuśika, Vasiṣṭha, Vy-aśva, who were regarded by
later generations as patriarchal sages or saints, occupy-
ing the same position in Indian history as the heroes
and patriarchs of other countries. They Ṛṣis con-
stitute a peculiar class of beings in the early mythical
system, as distinct from gods, men, Asuras, &c.;
they are the authors or rather seers of the Vedic
hymns, i. e. according to orthodox Hindū ideas they
are the inspired personages to whom these hymns
were revealed, and such an expression as ‘the Ṛṣi
says’ is equivalent to ‘so it stands in the sacred texts.’
Seven Ṛṣi, {%sapta ṛṣayaḥ%} or {%saptaṛṣayaḥ%} or
{%saptarṣayaḥ,%} are often mentioned in the Brāhmaṇas
and later works as typical representatives of the charac-
ter and spirit of the pre-historic or mythical period; in
the Śatapatha-Brāhmaṇa their names are given as
follows, Gotama, Bharadvāja, Viśvā-mitra, Jamadagni,
Vasiṣṭha, Kaśyapa, and Atri; in the Mahā-bhārata
thus, Marīci, Atri, Aṅgiras, Pulaha, Kratu, Pulastya,
Vasiṣṭha; in Manu they are called Prajāpatis or
patriarchs, and are reckoned as ten, three other names
being added, viz. Pracetas or Dakṣa, Bhṛgu, and Nā-
rada, these ten being created by Manu Svāyambhuva
[Page0182-a+ 79]
for the production of all other beings including gods
and men. The seven Ṛṣis form in astronomy the
constellation of ‘the Great Bear.’ Metaphorically,
the seven Ṛṣis may stand for the seven senses or
the seven vital airs of the body); in later times a
saint or sanctified sage in general, an ascetic, an an-
chorite, (sometimes three orders of these Ṛṣis are enu-
merated, viz. Devarṣis, Brahmarṣis, and Rājarṣis;
sometimes seven, four others being added, viz. Ma-
harṣis, Paramarṣis, Śrutarṣis, and Kāṇḍarṣis); a
ray of light; an imaginary circle; the fish Cyprinus
Ṛṣi; [cf. Hib. <nsi>arsan,</nsi> ‘a sage, a man old in
wisdom;’ <nsi>arrach,</nsi> ‘old, ancient, aged.’] {%—Ṛṣi-%}
