lating the euphonic combination of letters and their
pronunciation peculiar to one of the different Śākhās
or branches of the Vedas, i. e. to one of those
versions of the Vedic texts handed down in different
families in different parts of India, (the Prātiśākhyas
do not undo words in the same way as the Vyākaraṇa,
but take actually formed words as they occur in the
hymns and teach the phonetic changes they undergo,
the mode of pronouncing the accents, &c.; there
exist four Prātiśākhyas, 1. a Prātiśākhya to the
Śākala-śākhā of the Ṛg-veda, called Śākala-prāti-
śākhya and ascribed to Śaunaka; 2. to a Śākhā of
the Taittirīya or Black Yajur-veda; 3. to a Śākhā
of the Mādhyandinas who belong to the family of
the Vājasaneyins or authors of the White Yajur-veda,
whence this is called the Vājasaneyi-prātiśākhya, it
is attributed to Kātyāyana; 4. an Atharva-veda-prā-
tiśākhya, called Śaunakīyā Caturādhyāyikā; but no
Prātiśākhya has yet been found to the Sāma-veda.)
