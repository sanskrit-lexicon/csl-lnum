<nsi>weizd</nsi>), knowing, knowledge; ‘the true knowledge,
divine knowledge,’ N. of certain celebrated works
which constitute the basis of the first period of the
Hindū religion, (these works were originally three,
viz. 1. the Ṛg-veda, 2. the Yajur-veda [of which
there are, however, two divisions, see {%taittirīya-%}
{%saṃhitā, vājasaneyi-saṃhitā%}], 3. the Sāma-veda;
these three works are sometimes called collectively,
{%trayī,%} ‘the triple Vidyā’ or ‘threefold knowledge,’
but the Ṛg-veda is really the only original work
of the three, and much the most ancient, some of its
hymns being rather Indo-European than Hindū, and
representing the condition of the Āryans before their
final settlement in India; subsequently a fourth Veda
was added, called the Atharva-veda, which was pro-
bably not completely accepted till after Manu, as his
law-book often speaks of the three Vedas — calling
them {%trayam brahma sanātanam,%} ‘the triple
eternal Veda,’ and stating in I. 23. that the Creator
drew forth the Ṛg-veda from fire, the Yajur-veda
from air, and the Sāma-veda from the sun; and in
another place, IV. 124, stating that the Ṛg has the
gods for its deities, the Yajur has men, and the Sāma
has the Pitṛs, on which account the sound of this
latter is impure — but only once [XI. 33] mentions the
revelation made to Atharvan and Aṅgiras, without,
however, calling it by the later name of Atharva-
veda, the songs and incantations of the Atharvans
not being at that time recognised as a fourth Veda;
each of the four Vedas has two distinct parts, viz.
1. a Saṃhitā or collection of Mantras, i. e. of words
of prayer and adoration often addressed either to fire
or to some form of the sun or to some form of the
air, sky, wind, &c., and praying for health, wealth, long
life, cattle, offspring, victory, and even forgiveness of
sins, which words of prayer or praise form what is
usually called the Mantra portion of the Veda [see
{%mantra%}], and 2. a Brāhmaṇa portion consisting of
Vidhi and Artha-vāda, i. e. directions for the detail
of the ceremonies at which the Mantras were to be
used and explanations of the legends &c. connected
with the Mantras [see {%brāhmaṇa, vidhi%}], both
these portions being termed {%Śruti,%} revelation orally
communicated by the Deity, and heard but not com-
posed or written down by men; although both portions
are supposed by orthodox Hindūs to have existed
from eternity, and not to require {%pramāṇa,%} ‘proof,’
as they are themselves Pramāṇa, yet the oldest of
the Mantras are not likely to belong to a much earlier
date than the twelfth or thirteenth century B. C.;
and it is certain that both Mantras and Brāhmaṇas
were compositions spread over a considerable period,
much of the latter being comparatively modern: as
the Vedas are properly three, so the Mantras are
properly of three forms, 1. Ṛc, which are verses of
praise in metre, and intended for loud recitation;
2. Yajus, which are in prose, and intended for use
at sacrifices; 3. Sāman, which are in metre, and
intended for chanting at the Soma or Moon-plant
ceremonies, the Mantras of the Atharva-veda having
no special name; but it must be borne in mind that
the Yajur and Sāma-veda hymns, especially the latter,
besides their own Mantras, borrow largely from the
Ṛg-veda; the Yajur-veda and Sāma-veda being in
fact not so much collections of prayers and hymns as
[Page0964-a+ 81]
special prayer and hymn-books intended as liturgical
or sacrificial manuals for the Adhvaryu and Udgātṛ
priests respectively, the necessity for which grew out
of the vast and complicated ritual elaborated by the
Āryans after they had settled down in India [see
{%yajur-veda, sāma-veda%}]; the more modern Atharva-
veda-saṃhitā, on the other hand, is, like the Ṛg-
veda, a real collection of original hymns mixed up with
incantations, borrowing little from the Ṛg, having
no direct relation to mere ritual or sacrifices, but
supposed by mere recitation to produce long life, to
cure diseases [generally in connection with the use of
some plant or drug gifted with magical properties],
to obtain success in love or gaming, to effect the
ruin of enemies, and to secure the reciter's own pros-
perity; each of the four Vedas seems to have passed
through numerous Śākhās or schools, giving rise to
various recensions of the text, though the Ṛg-veda
is only preserved in the Śākala recension; as to
arrangement, the Mantras being made up in the first
instance of separate Padas or words are joined together
so as to form Sūktas or hymns; the hymns of the
Yajur-veda, with the exception of its last book, which
is thought to be mystical, are arranged according to
the sacrifices at which its Mantras were used, and
those of the Sāma-veda with reference especially to
the Moon-plant sacrifices, but those of the Ṛg-veda
Mantras having no direct reference to sacrificial acts
are arranged either according to their authors and
the objects addressed or according to mere bulk;
the former is the distribution into ten Maṇḍalas, the
first and last three Maṇḍalas including a variety of
authors or rather Ṛṣis [who are said to have seen
the Vedas and not composed them], and each of the
other Maṇḍalas belonging to one particular Ṛṣi;
the latter is the distribution into Aṣṭakas [see {%maṇ-%}
{%ḍala, varga%}]: a tradition makes Vyāsa the com-
piler and arranger of the Vedas in their present
form: they each have an Anukramaṇī or Index,
giving the first word of every hymn, the number of
verses, the name of the {%devatā%} or deified being
about which the Mantra is concerned [sometimes,
however, the {%devatā%} may be an inanimate object],
the names and families of the authors and the metre,
the principal work of this kind being the Sarvānu-
kramaṇī or general Index; out of the Brāhmaṇa
portion of the Veda grew two other departments of
Vedic literature, sometimes included under the general
name Veda, viz. the strings of aphoristic rules, called
Sūtras [though these are often said to be {%pauruṣeya,%}
i. e. human compositions], and the mystical treatises
on the nature of God and the relation of soul and
matter, called Upaniṣads, which were appended to
the Āraṇyakas, certain chapters of the Brāhmaṇas so
obscure and awe-inspiring in their allusions to the
Supreme Spirit of the Universe that they had to be
read in the solitude of forests; the most important
of the former are the Kalpa-sūtras or Śrauta-sūtras
as founded directly on Śruti; these strings of rules
being in fact guides to the rambling discursive Brāh-
maṇas and systematized directories for the due per-
formance of every part of the ceremonial, while the
Upaniṣads, on the other hand, taught the secret
doctrine [called {%rahasya%} in Manu II. 165. and {%ve-%}
{%dānta%} in VI. 83, 94] underlying the ceremonial, viz.
the existence of one Universal Spirit, called Brahma,
with which the whole creation and the human soul
itself was identified; as the Śrauta-sūtras were fol-
lowed by the Gṛhya and Sāmayācārika Sūtras or
‘rules for domestic ceremonies and conventional cus-
toms,’ which again became the forerunners of the
Dharma-śāstras and thus linked the Veda with the
code of Manu, so the Āraṇyakas were followed by
the Upaniṣads, which latter became the real Veda of
thinking Hindūs, leading to the Darśanas or systems
of philosophy, and linking them also with Vedic
literature: in modern writings the name of ‘fifth
Veda' is accorded to the Itihāsas or legendary epic
poems and the Purāṇas, and certain Upa-vedas or
secondary Vedas are enumerated, that of the Ṛg-
veda being the Āyur-veda or Veda on medicine, that
[Page0964-b+ 81]
of the Yajur being the Dhanur-veda or Veda on
archery, that of the Sāma being the Gāndharva-veda
or Veda on music, and that of the Atharva-veda
being either the Sthāpatya-veda or Artha-śāstra or
Śilpa-śāstra, q. q. v. v.; the Vedāṅgas or works serv-
ing as limbs [for preserving the integrity] of the
Veda, of which the Kalpa-sūtras form a part, are
explained under {%vedāṅga,%} col. 3: the only other
works included under the head of Veda being the
Pariśiṣṭas, which supply rules for the ritual omitted
in other works; in the Bṛhad-āraṇyaka Upaniṣad
the Vedas and all the above literature are represented
as the breathings of Brahmā, while in some of the
Purāṇas the four Vedas are said to have been created
by the four-faced Brahmā from his several mouths,

of certain works or classes of works regarded as
auxiliary to and even in some sense as part of the
Veda, (their object was to secure the proper pro-
nunciation and correctness of the text and the right
employment of the Mantras at sacrifices as taught
in the Brāhmaṇas; six subjects are usually enume-
rated under which these works are comprised, and
six works are given as representatives of these subjects,
mostly written in the Sūtra or aphoristic style, but
whether all of these are the original representa-
tives of the various subjects is doubtful; 1. {%Śikṣā,%}
‘the science of proper articulation and pronunciation,’
comprising the knowledge of letters, accents, quantity,
the use of the organs of pronunciation, and phonetics
generally, but especially the laws of euphony peculiar
to the Veda; one short treatise consisting in one
recension of thirty-five and in another of fifty-nine
verses, and a chapter of the Taittirīya-āraṇyaka are
regarded as the representatives of this subject; but
the more modern Prātiśākhyas and other works
on Vedic phonetics may be included under it, [see
{%prātiśākhya%}]: 2. {%Chandas,%} ‘metre,’ represented
by a treatise ascribed to Piṅgala-nāga, which, how-
ever, treats of Prākṛt as well as Sanskrit metres,
and includes only a few of the leading Vedic metres:
3. {%Vy-ākaraṇa,%} ‘linguistic analysis or grammar,’
said to be represented by Pāṇini's celebrated Sūtras,
but as this great work only treats of Vedic grammar
exceptionally, this Vedāṅga is more properly identi-
fied with the lost grammatical Sūtras which preceded
Pāṇini: 4. {%Nir-ukta,%} ‘explanation of difficult Vedic
words,’ represented by the Nirukta of Yāska, which
consists of five chapters of mere lists of words, three
belonging to the Naighaṇṭuka section of synonyms,
one to the Naigama of separate words, and one
to the Daivata of divinities and the other objects
[Page0965-a+ 81]
addressed in the Mantras; after which come twelve
chapters of explanation with an introduction, to which
is also added a Pariśiṣṭa of two other chapters, [see
{%yāska%}]: 5. {%Jyotiṣa,%} ‘astronomy,’ or rather the
Vedic calendar, represented by a small tract in a
more modern style than the Sūtra works, the object
of which is to fix the most auspicious days for sacri-
fices: 6. {%Kalpa,%} ‘ceremonial,’ represented by a large
number of Sūtra works intended to systematize the
tedious and confused ritualistic precepts of the Brāh-
maṇas; each of the Vedas has its own Kalpa or
Śrauta Sūtras, [see {%sūtra%} and cf. {%veda,%} p. 963]:
the first and second of these Vedāṅgas is said to
be intended to secure the correct reading or recitation
of the Veda, the third and fourth the understanding
of it, and the fifth and sixth its proper employment
at sacrifices: the Vedāṅgas are alluded to by Manu,
who calls them, in III. 184, Pravacanas, ‘expo-
sitions,’ a term which is said to be also applied to
the Brāhmaṇas.) {%—Vedāṅgin, ī,%} m. one who studies
or teaches the Vedāṅgas. {%—Vedādi (°da-ādi),%} n.

or {%vedādhipati (°da-adh°), is,%} m. ‘one who presides
over the Veda,’ a term applied to certain of the
planets, (thus the Ṛg-veda is said to be presided
over by the planet Jupiter or Bṛhas-pati, the Yajur-
veda by Venus, the Sāma-veda by Mars, and the
Atharva-veda by Mercury.) {%—Vedādhyayana (°da-%}

‘end of the Veda,’ N. of the second and most im-
portant part of the Mīmāṃsā or third of the three
great divisions of Hindū philosophy (so called either
as teaching the ultimate aim and scope of the Veda
or simply as founded on the Upaniṣads which come
at the end of the Veda; this system, although be-
longing to the Mīmāṃsā school [see {%mīmāṃsā%}] and
sometimes called Uttara-mīmāṃsā, ‘examination of
the later portion or {%jñāna-kāṇḍa%} of the Veda,’
i. e. of that portion contained in the Āraṇyakas and
Upaniṣads [which teach the knowledge of Brahma or
the Universal Spirit], stands out prominently by itself
as representing the popular pantheistic creed of the
Hindūs of the present day, which is really based on
the Upaniṣads and constitutes the true Veda of
the modern cultivated Brāhman, underlying also
all the polytheism and multiform mythology of
the people; it explains the universe synthetically
as a development from one principle, and so
differs from the analytical Nyāya which treats of
the various objects constituting the material world
as it finds them, without investigating their mutual
relation of effect and cause, and from the Sāṅkhya
which, although also synthetic, propounds a duality
of principles to account for the visible universe;
according to the Vedānta doctrine, Brahma [nom.
neut. of {%brahman%}] or the Supreme Soul, also called
Paramātman, is both the efficient and material cause
of the world; the Ātman or individual human soul,
as well as all the phenomena of nature, being really
identical with the Paramātman, and their existence
being only the result of Ajñāna or an assumed igno-
rance on the part of this Supreme Soul, who is
described as both Creator and Creation, Actor and
Act, Existence, Knowledge, Joy, and as devoid of
the three qualities, [see {%guṇa%}]; the liberation of the
human soul, its deliverance from transmigrations, and
re-union with the Paramātman, with which it is
really identified, is only to be effected by a removal
of that ignorance which prevents the consciousness
of this identity and by a proper understanding of the
truth of the Vedānta; this system is also sometimes
[Page0965-b+ 81]
called Brahma-mīmāṃsā and Śārīraka-mīmāṃsā, ‘in-
vestigation of the embodied soul:’ the founder of the
school is said to have been Vyāsa, also called Bādarā-
yaṇa, and its most eminent teacher was Śaṅkarā-
cārya); ({%ās%}), m. pl. the Upaniṣads (see Kullūka on
