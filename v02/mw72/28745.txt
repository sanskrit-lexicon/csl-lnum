{%Pāṇini, is,%}¦ m. (probably fr. {%pāṇina%} above), N.
of the most eminent Hindū grammarian (regarded
as an inspired Muni; according to one legend his
grandfather was an inspired legislator called Devala,
and his mother's name was Dākṣī, see {%dākṣeya;%}
the date at which he lived is a subject of controversy,
but he is generally placed in the middle of the
fourth century B. C.; from Śalātura, thought to
have been the dwelling-place of his ancestors, he is
said by some to have been called Śālāturīya; cf.
Pāṇ. IV. 3, 94).
