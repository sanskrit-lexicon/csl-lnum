{#rAhu#}¦ {%rāhu, us,%} m. (said to be fr. rt. {%rah;%}
probably connected with rts. {%rabh, grabh%}), ‘the
looser’ or ‘the seizer,’ N. of a Daitya or demon who
is supposed to seize the sun and moon and thus
cause eclipses, (according to the common myth
he was a son of Vipra-citti and Sinhikā, and had
four arms, his lower part ending in a tail; he was the
instigator of all mischief among the Daityas, and
when the gods had produced the Amṛta or nectar
from the churned ocean, he disguised himself like
one of them and drank a portion of it, but the Sun
and Moon having detected his fraud and informed
Viṣṇu, the latter severed his head and two of his
arms from the rest of his body; the portion of nectar
he had swallowed having secured his immortality,
the head and tail were transferred to the stellar
sphere, the head wreaking its vengeance on the Sun
and Moon by occasionally swallowing them for a
time, while the tail, under the name of Ketu, gave
birth to a numerous progeny of comets and fiery
meteors: in astronomy Rāhu is variously regarded
as a dragon's head, as the ascending node of the
moon, or as one of the planets); an eclipse or
(rather) the moment of occultation or obscuration;
the regent of the south-west quarter. {%—Rāhu-gata,%}
