({%am%}), n. power, force, the quality which belongs
especially to the mighty Indra; exhibition of power,

five senses. (In addition to the five organs of per-
ception, {%buddhīndriyāṇi%} or {%jñānendriyāṇi,%} i. e.
eye, ear, nose, tongue, and skin, the Hindūs enu-
merate five organs of action, {%karmendriyāṇi,%} i. e.
larynx, hand, foot, anus, and parts of generation; be-
tween these ten organs and the soul or {%ātman%} stands
{%manas%} or mind, considered as an eleventh organ.
In the Vedānta, {%manas, buddhi, ahaṅkāra,%} and
{%citta%} form the four inner or internal organs, {%antar-%}
{%indriyāṇi,%} so that according to this reckoning the
organs are fourteen in number, each being presided
over by its own ruler or {%niyantṛ;%} thus, the eye by
the Sun, the ear by the Quarters of the world, the
nose by the two Aśvins, the tongue by Pracetas, the
skin by the Wind, the voice by Fire, the hand by
Indra, the foot by Viṣṇu, the anus by Mitra, the
parts of generation by Prajāpati, manas by the Moon,
buddhi by Brahman, ahaṅkāra by Śiva, citta by
Viṣṇu as Acyuta. In the Nyāya philosophy each
organ is connected with its own peculiar element,
the nose with the Earth, the tongue with Water, the
eye with Light or Fire, the skin with Air, the ear with
Ether. The Jainas divide the whole creation into
five sections, according to the number of organs
attributed to each being.) {%—Indriya-kāma, as, ā,%}
