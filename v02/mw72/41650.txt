originally personifications, like other Vedic deities, of
natural phenomena, and are usually mentioned with
the other Gaṇas or classes common in the Veda, viz.
the eleven Rudras and the twelve Ādityas, constitut-
ing with them and with Dyaus, ‘Heaven,’ and Pṛ-
thivī, ‘Earth’ [or, according to some, with Indra and
Prajā-pati, or, according to others, with the two
