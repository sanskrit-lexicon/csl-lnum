<div n="P"/>Much confusion exists concerning this substance as will become
apparent from the material collected:
<div n="P"/>(1) Bpn, {%karpūrādivarga%} 120: it is also called {%kapitthatvac%} (the bark
of {%kapittha%}). Acc. to the Hindī comm. (p. 262-263) the substance is
described somewhere in Bhā. pra. as resembling {%kaṅkola%} and smelling
like {%kuṣṭha.%} In the same comm. three different identifications are made
[Page-531+ 39]
mention of: a) <bot>PRUNUS CERASUS LINN.</bot>, b) <bot>GISEKIA PHARNACIOIDES
LINN.</bot>, c) <bot>MUKIA SCABRELLA ARN.</bot> (Index Kewensis: <bot>MELOTHRIA
MADERASPATANA COGN.</bot> = <bot>MUKIA SCABRELLA ARN.</bot> = <bot>MUKIA MADERA-

<div n="P"/>(2) DWH 2, p. 105-107: <bot>GISEKIA PHARNACIOIDES LINN.</bot>; p. 105:
“This plant is called in Sanskrit {%vāluka%} and {%elavāluka%} on account of
the number of large raphides contained in the leaves, and which give
them the appearance of being full of sand ({%vālu%}).” (Raphides are
minute intracellular crystals, usually of an acicular form).
<div n="P"/>(3) Gul: cherry tree (<bot>PRUNUS CERASUS LINN.</bot>).
<div n="P"/>(4) HB, p. 21: <bot>GISEKIA PHARNACIOIDES LINN.</bot>; ibid., footnote 70:
“{%elavālu%} is mentioned Su. Sū. 38, 14, where Ḍa.'s comm. explains it as
a reddish powder ({%harivāluka%}), resembling that of the seeds of the
{%kṛṣṇagandhā (kṛṣṇagandhikaphala).%} The latter is a name of the horse-
radish tree or {%śigru%} or {%śobhāñjana;%}” ibid., p. 91, footnote 74: “In
the Phar. Ind. (= DWH) 2, p. 105, it is wrongly identified with {%vāluka;%}
the seeds, supplied to me by a native druggist, seem to be simply those
of chickweed.”
<div n="P"/>(5) HK: quotes the identifications of PW and Hoernle.
<div n="P"/>(6) Kav, p. 37: a kind of red powder made of some seeds obtainable
of every native druggist, not identified; p. 294: a fragrant powder of

wood apparently dry but juicy within; it is brought from Nepal.
