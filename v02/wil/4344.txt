{#aSvameDa#}¦ m. ({#-DaH#}) The actual or emblematic sacrifice of a horse.
.E. {#aSva#} and {#meDa#} sacrifice; this sacrifice is one of the highest
order, and performed a hundred times, entitles the sacrificer to the dominion of
{%Svarga%} or paradise: it appears to have been originally typical; the horse,
and other animals being simply bound during the performance of certain
ceremonies; the actual sacrifice is an introduction of a later period. See {%As.%}
