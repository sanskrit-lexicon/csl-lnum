a son was then born to him named <s1>Rohita</s1>, but <s1>Hariścandra</s1> put off on various pretexts the fulfilment of his vow, and when he at length consented to perform it, his son refused to be sacrificed, and retiring to the forest passed six years there until he met a poor <ns>Brāhman</ns> <s1>Ṛṣi</s1> named <s1>Ajīgarta</s1>, who had three sons, the second of whom, <s1>Śunaḥ-śepa</s1>, was purchased by <s1>Rohita</s1> for a hundred cows to serve as a substitute for himself <pb n="1083,1"/>;
