¦ <s>ka</s> is occasionally used alone as an indefinite pronoun, especially in negative sentences (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>na kasya ko vallaBaH</s>, no one is a favourite of any one;
<s>nA<srs/>nyo jAnAti kaH</s>, no one else knows;
<s>kaTaM sa GAtayati kam</s>, how does he kill any one?) Generally, however, <s>ka</s> is only made indefinite when connected with the particles <s>ca</s>, <s>cana/</s>, <s>cid</s>, <s>vA</s>, and <s>a/pi</s>, in which case <s>ka</s> may sometimes be preceded by the relative <s>ya</s> (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>ye ke ca</s>, any persons whatsoever;
<s>yasyE kasyE ca devatAyE</s>, to any deity whatsoever;
<s>yAni kAni ca mitrARi</s>, any friends whatsoever;
<s>yat kiMca</s>, whatever). 
The particle <s>cana</s>, being composed of <s>ca</s> and <s>na</s>, properly gives a negative force to the pronoun (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>yasmAd indrAd fte kiMcana</s>, without which <s1 slp1="indra">Indra</s1> there is nothing), but the negative sense is generally dropped (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>kaScana</s>, any one;
<s>na kaScana</s>, no one), and a relative is sometimes connected with it (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>yat kiMcana</s>, anything whatsoever). Examples of <s>cid</s> with the interrogative are common <s>vA</s> and <s>api</s> are not so common, but the latter is often found in classical <ns>Sanskṛt</ns> (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>kaScid</s>, any one;
<s>kecid</s>, some;
<s>na kaScid</s>, no one;
<s>na kiMcid api</s>, nothing whatsoever;
<s>yaH kaScid</s>, any one whatsoever;
<s>kecit</s> - <s>kecit</s>, some - others;
<s>yasmin kasmin vA deSe</s>, in any country whatsoever;
<s>na ko 'pi</s>, no one;
<s>na kimapi</s>, nothing whatever). <s>ka</s> may sometimes be used, like 2. <s>kad</s>, at the beginning of a compound. See <s>ka-pUya</s>, &c.
