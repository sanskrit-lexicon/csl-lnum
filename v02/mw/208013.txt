¦ ‘a worshipper of <s1 n="Viṣṇu">V°</s1>’, <ab>N.</ab> of one of the three great divisions of modern <ns>Hindūism</ns> (the other two being the <s1>Śaiva</s1>s and <s1>Śākta</s1>s;
the <s1>Vaiṣṇava</s1>s identify <s1>Viṣṇu</s1> — rather than <s1>Brahmā</s1> and <s1>Śiva</s1> — with the supreme Being, and are exclusively devoted to his worship;
they have become separated into four principal and some minor sects, as follow: 1. the <s1>Rāmānuja</s1>s, founded by <s1>Rāmānuja</s1>, who is said to have lived for 120 years [from 1017 till 1137 <ab>A.D.</ab>] <pb n="1027,3"/>;
his chief doctrines are described at <pcol>p. 878, col. 1</pcol>, and in <ls>RTL. p. 119</ls> &c.;
one peculiarity of his sect is the scrupulous preparation and privacy of three meals;
2. the <s1>Mādhva</s1>s, founded by a Kanarese <ns>Brāhman</ns> named <s1>Madhva</s1>, whose chief doctrines are described at <pcol>p. 782, col. 3</pcol>, and in <ls>RTL. p. 130</ls> &c.; 3. the <s1>Vallabha</s1>s, founded by <s1>Vallabhācārya</s1>, whose chief doctrines are described at <pcol>p. 928, col. 3</pcol>, and in <ls>RTL. p. 134</ls> &c.;
4. a sect in Bengal founded by <s1>Caitanya</s1> [<ab>q.v.</ab>] who was regarded by his followers as an incarnation of <s1>Kṛṣṇa</s1>;
his chief doctrine was the duty of <s>Bakti</s>, or love for that god which was to be so strong that no caste-feelings could exist with it [see, <ls>RTL. p. 140</ls> &c.] Of the minor <s1>Vaiṣṇava</s1> sects those founded by <s1>Nimbārka</s1> or <s1>Nimbāditya</s1> [<ls>RTL. 146</ls>] and by <s1>Rāmānanda</s1> [<ls>RTL. 147</ls>] and by <s1>Svāmi-Nārāyaṇa</s1> [<ls>RTL. 148</ls>] are perhaps the most important, to which also may be added the reformed theistic sect founded by <ns>Kabīr</ns> [<ls>RTL. 158</ls>] and the Sikh theistic sect founded by <ns>Nānak</ns> [<ls>RTL. 161</ls>])<info lex="inh"/>
