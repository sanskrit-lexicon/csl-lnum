he is represented as a great patron of literature;
nine celebrated men are said to have flourished at his court [see <s>nava-ratna</s>], and innumerable legends are related of him all teeming with exaggerations;
according to some he fell in a battle with his rival <s1>Śāli-vāhana</s1>, king of the south country or Deccan, and the legendary date given for his death is <s1>Kali-yuga</s1> 3044 [which really is the epoch-year of the <s1>Vikrama</s1> era];
