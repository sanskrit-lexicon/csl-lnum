<s>vi/zRu</s> ¦ <lex>m.</lex> (<ab>prob.</ab> <ab>fr.</ab> √ <s>viz</s>, ‘All-pervader’ or ‘Worker’) <ab>N.</ab> of one of the principal <ns>Hindū</ns> deities (in the later mythology regarded as ‘the preserver’, and with <s1>Brahmā</s1> ‘the creator’ and <s1>Śiva</s1> ‘the destroyer’, constituting the well-known <s1>Tri-mūrti</s1> or triad;
although <s1>Viṣṇu</s1> comes second in the triad he is identified with the supreme deity by his worshippers;
in the Vedic period, however, he is not placed in the foremost rank, although he is frequently invoked with other gods
[<ab>esp.</ab> with <s1>Indra</s1> whom he assists in killing <s1>Vṛtra</s1> and with whom he drinks the <s1>Soma</s1> juice; <ab>cf.</ab> his later names <s1>Indrānuja</s1> and <s1>Upendra</s1>];
as distinguished from the other Vedic deities, he is a personification of the light and of the sun, <ab>esp.</ab> in his striding over the heavens, which he is said to do in three paces [see <s>tri-vikrama</s> and <ab>cf.</ab> <s>bali</s>, <s>vAmana</s>], explained as denoting the threefold manifestations of light in the form of fire, lightning, and the sun, or as designating the three daily stations of the sun in his rising, culminating, and setting <pb n="999,2"/>;
<s1>Viṣṇu</s1> does not appear to have been included at first among the <s1>Āditya</s1>s [<ab>q.v.</ab>], although in later times he is accorded the foremost place among them;
in the <s1>Brāhmaṇa</s1>s he is identified with sacrifice, and in one described as a dwarf;
in the <s1>Mahā-bhārata</s1> and <s1>Rāmāyaṇa</s1> he rises to the supremacy which in some places he now enjoys as the most popular deity of modern <ns>Hindū</ns> worship;
the great rivalry between him and <s1>Śiva</s1> [<ab>cf.</ab> <s>vEzRava</s> and <s>SEva</s>] is not fully developed till the period of the <s1>Purāṇa</s1>s: the distinguishing feature in the character of the Post-vedic <s1>Viṣṇu</s1> is his condescending to become incarnate in a portion of his essence on ten principal occasions, to deliver mankind from certain great dangers [<ab>cf.</ab> <s>avatAra</s> and <ls>IW. 327</ls>];
some of the <s1>Purāṇa</s1>s make 22 incarnations, or even 24, instead of 10;
the <s1>Vaiṣṇava</s1>s regard <s1>Viṣṇu</s1> as the supreme being, and often identify him with <s1>Nārāyaṇa</s1>, the personified <s1>Puruṣa</s1> or primeval living spirit
[described as moving on the waters, reclining on <s1>Śeṣa</s1>, the serpent of infinity, while the god <s1>Brahmā</s1> emerges from a lotus growing from his navel; <ab>cf.</ab> <ls>Manu. i, 10</ls>];
the wives of <s1>Viṣṇu</s1> are <s1>Aditi</s1> and <s1>Sinīvālī</s1>, later <s1>Lakṣmī</s1> or <s1>Śrī</s1> and even <s1>Sarasvatī</s1>;
his son is <s1>Kāma-deva</s1>, god of love, and his paradise is called <s1>Vaikuṇṭha</s1>;
he is usually represented with a peculiar mark on his breast called <s1>Śrī-vatsa</s1>, and as holding a <s>SaNKa</s>, or conch-shell called <s1>Pāñcajanya</s1>, a <s>cakra</s> or quoit-like missile-weapon called <s1>Su-darśana</s1>, a <s>gadA</s> or club called <s1>Kaumodakī</s1> and a <s>padma</s> or lotus;
he has also a bow called <s1>Śārṅga</s1>, and a sword called <s1>Nandaka</s1>;
his <s>vAhana</s> or vehicle is <s1>Garuḍa</s1> <ab>q.v.</ab>;
he has a jewel on his wrist called <s1>Syamantaka</s1>, another on his breast called <s1>Kaustubha</s1>, and the river Ganges is said to issue from his foot;
the demons slain by him in his character of ‘preserver from evil’, or by <s1>Kṛṣṇa</s1> as identified with him, are <s1>Madhu</s1>, <s1>Dhenuka</s1>, <s1>Cāṇūra</s1>, <s1>Yamala</s1>, and <s1>Arjuna</s1> [see <s>yamalA<srs/>rjuna</s>], <s1>Kāla-nemi</s1>, <s1>Haya-grīva</s1>, <s1>Śakaṭa</s1>, <s1>Ariṣṭa</s1>, <s1>Kaiṭabha</s1>, <s1>Kaṃsa</s1>, <s1>Keśin</s1>, <s1>Mura</s1>, <s1>Śālva</s1>, <s1>Mainda</s1>, <s1>Dvi-vida</s1>, <s1>Rāhu</s1>, <s1>Hiraṇya-kaśipu</s1>, <s1>Bāṇa</s1>, <s1>Kāliya</s1>, <s1>Naraka</s1>, <s1>Bali</s1>;
he is worshipped under a thousand names, which are all enumerated in <ls>MBh. xiii, 6950</ls>-<ls n="MBh. xiii,">7056</ls>;
he is sometimes regarded as the divinity of the lunar mansion called <s1>Śravaṇa</s1>), <ls>RV.</ls> &c. &c. (<ab>cf.</ab> <ls>RTL. 44</ls>;
