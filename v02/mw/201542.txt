he was at first a functionary, together with <s1>Vasiṣṭha</s1>, of <s1>Su-dās</s1>, king of the <s1>Tṛtsu</s1>s;
seeing <s1 n="Vasiṣṭha">V°</s1> preferred by the king, he went over to the <s1>Bharata</s1>s, but could not prevent their being defeated by <s1>Su-dās</s1>, although he caused the waters of the rivers <s1>Vipāś</s1> and <s1>Śutudrī</s1> to retire and so give the <s1>Bharata</s1>s free passage, <ls>RV. iii, 33</ls>;
he was born as a <s1>Kṣatriya</s1>, deriving his lineage from an ancestor of <s1>Kuśika</s1>, named <s1>Purū-ravas</s1>, of the lunar race of kings, and himself sovereign of <s1>Kanyā-kubja</s1> or <ns>Kanoj</ns>;
his fame rests chiefly on his contests with the great <ns>Brāhman</ns> <s1>Vasiṣṭha</s1>, and his success in elevating himself, though a <s1>Kṣatriya</s1>, to the rank of a <ns>Brāhman</ns> See <ls>Manu. vii, 42</ls> : the <s1>Rāmāyaṇa</s1>, which makes him a companion and counsellor of the young <s1>Rāma-candra</s1>, records [<ls n="RV.">i, 51</ls>-<ls n="RV. i,">65</ls>] how <s1>Viśvāmitra</s1>, on his accession to the throne, visited <s1>Vasiṣṭha</s1>'s hermitage, and seeing there the cow of plenty [probably typical of <s>go</s>, ‘the earth’], offered him untold treasures in exchange for it, but being refused, prepared to take it by force;
a long contest ensued between the king and the saint [symbolical of the struggles between the <s1>Kṣatriya</s1> and <ns>Brāhmanical</ns> classes], which ended in the defeat of <s1>Viśvāmitra</s1>, whose vexation was such that, in order to become a <ns>Brāhman</ns> and thus conquer his rival, he devoted himself to intense austerities [during which he was seduced by the nymph <s1>Menakā</s1> and had by her a daughter, <s1>Śakuntalā</s1>], gradually increasing the rigour of his mortification through thousands of years, till he successively earned the titles of <s1>Rājarṣi</s1>, <s1>Ṛṣi</s1>, <s1>Maharṣi</s1>, and finally <s1>Brahmarṣi</s1> <pb n="995,1"/>;
he is supposed to be the author of nearly the whole of <ls>RV. iii</ls>, and of <ls n="RV.">ix, 67, 13</ls>-<ls n="RV. ix, 67,">15</ls>; <ls n="RV.">x, 137, 5</ls>; <ls n="RV. x,">167</ls>;
