¦ <ab>N.</ab> of a celebrated <ns>Avatār</ns> of the god <s1>Viṣṇu</s1>, or sometimes identified with <s1>Viṣṇu</s1> himself [<ls>MBh. v, 2563</ls>; <ls n="MBh.">xiv, 1589 ff.</ls>; <ls>Hariv. 2359</ls> &c.]
as distinct from his ten <ns>Avatārs</ns> or incarnations (in the earlier legends he appears as a great hero and teacher [<ls>MBh.</ls>; <ls>Bhag.</ls>];
in the more recent he is deified, and is often represented as a young and amorous shepherd with flowing hair and a flute in his hand;
the following are a few particulars of his birth and history as related in <ls>Hariv. 3304 ff.</ls> and in the <s1>Purāṇa</s1>s &c.: <s1>Vasu-deva</s1>, who was a descendant of <s1>Yadu</s1> and <s1>Yayāti</s1>, had two wives, <s1>Rohiṇī</s1> and <s1>Devakī</s1>;
the latter had eight sons of whom the eighth was <s1>Kṛṣṇa</s1>;
<s1>Kaṃsa</s1>, king of <s1>Mathurā</s1> and cousin of <s1>Devakī</s1>, was informed by a prediction that one of these sons would kill him;
he therefore kept <s1>Vasu-deva</s1> and his wife in confinement, and slew their first six children;
the seventh was <s1>Balarāma</s1> who was saved by being abstracted from the womb of <s1>Devakī</s1> and transferred to that of <s1>Rohiṇī</s1>;
the eighth was <s1>Kṛṣṇa</s1> who was born with black skin and a peculiar mark on his breast;
his father <s1>Vasu-deva</s1> managed to escape from <s1>Mathurā</s1> with the child, and favoured by the gods found a herdsman named <s1>Nanda</s1> whose wife <s1>Yaśo-dā</s1> had just been delivered of a son which <s1>Vasu-deva</s1> conveyed to <s1>Devakī</s1> after substituting his own in its place. <s1>Nanda</s1> with his wife <s1>Yaśo-dā</s1> took the infant <s1>Kṛṣṇa</s1> and settled first in <s1>Gokula</s1> or <s1>Vraja</s1>, and afterwards in <s1>Vṛndāvana</s1>, where <s1>Kṛṣṇa</s1> and <s1>Bala-rāma</s1> grew up together, roaming in the woods and joining in the sports of the herdsmen's sons <pb n="306,3"/>;
<s1>Kṛṣṇa</s1> as a youth contested the sovereignty of <s1>Indra</s1>, and was victorious over that god, who descended from heaven to praise <s1>Kṛṣṇa</s1>, and made him lord over the cattle [<ls>Hariv. 3787 ff.</ls>; <ls n="Hariv.">7456 ff.</ls>; <ls>VP.</ls>];
<s1>Kṛṣṇa</s1> is described as sporting constantly with the <s1>Gopī</s1>s or shepherdesses [<ls>Hariv. 4078 ff.</ls>; <ls n="Hariv.">8301 ff.</ls>; <ls>VP.</ls>; <ls>Gīt.</ls>]
of whom a thousand became his wives, though only eight are specified, <s1>Rādhā</s1> being the favourite [<ls>Hariv. 6694 ff.</ls>; <ls n="Hariv.">9177 ff.</ls>; <ls>VP.</ls>];
<s1>Kṛṣṇa</s1> built and fortified a city called <s1>Dvārakā</s1> in <ns>Gujarāt</ns>, and thither transported the inhabitants of <s1>Mathurā</s1> after killing <s1>Kaṃsa</s1>;
<s1>Kṛṣṇa</s1> had various wives besides the <s1>Gopī</s1>s, and by <s1>Rukmiṇī</s1> had a son <s1>Pradyumna</s1> who is usually identified with <s1>Kāma-deva</s1>;
with <ns>Jain</ns>s, <s1>Kṛṣṇa</s1> is one of the nine black <s1>Vasu-deva</s1>s;
with <ns>Buddhists</ns> he is the chief of the black demons, who are the enemies of <s1>Buddha</s1> and the white demons)<info lex="inh"/>
