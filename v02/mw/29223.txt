¦ the number five as symbolical of the five senses. (In addition to the five organs of perception, <s>budDI<srs/>ndriyARi</s> or <s>jYAne<srs/>ndriyARi</s>, <ab>i.e.</ab> eye, ear, nose, tongue, and skin, the <ns>Hindūs</ns> enumerate five organs of action, <s>karme<srs/>ndriyARi</s> <ab>i.e.</ab> larynx, hand, foot, anus, and parts of generation;
between these ten organs and the soul or <s>Atman</s> stands <s>manas</s> or mind, considered as an eleventh organ;
in the <s1>Vedānta</s1>, <s>manas</s>, <s>budDi</s>, <s>ahaMkAra</s>, and <s>citta</s> form the four inner or internal organs, <s>antar-indriyARi</s>, so that according to this reckoning the organs are fourteen in number, each being presided over by its own ruler or <s>niyantf</s>;
thus, the eye by the Sun, the ear by the Quarters of the world, the nose by the two <s1>Aśvin</s1>s, the tongue by <s1>Pracetas</s1>, the skin by the Wind, the voice by Fire, the hand by <s1>Indra</s1>, the foot by <s1>Viṣṇu</s1>, the anus by <s1>Mitra</s1>, the parts of generation by <s1>Prajāpati</s1>, manas by the Moon, <s1>buddhi</s1> by <s1>Brahman</s1>, <s1>ahaṃkāra</s1> by <s1>Śiva</s1>, citta by <s1>Viṣṇu</s1> as <s1>Acyuta</s1>;
in the <s1>Nyāya</s1> philosophy each organ is connected with its own peculiar element, the nose with the Earth, the tongue with Water, the eye with Light or Fire, the skin with Air, the ear with Ether;
the <s1>Jaina</s1>s divide the whole creation into five sections, according to the number of organs attributed to each being.)<info lex="inh"/>
