the twenty-fifth being <s1>Puruṣa</s1> or Spirit [sometimes called Soul] which is neither a Producer nor Production [see <s>vikAra</s>], but wholly distinct from the twenty-four other <s1>Tattva</s1>s, and is multitudinous, each separate <s1>Puruṣa</s1> by its union with <s1>Prakṛti</s1> causing a separate creation out of <s1>Prakṛti</s1>, the object of the philosophy being to effect the final liberation of the <s1>Puruṣa</s1> or Spirit from the fetters caused by that creation;
