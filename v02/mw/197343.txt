according to a legend related in <ls>MBh. iii, 8782</ls> &c., the personified <s1>Vindhya</s1>, jealous of <s1>Himālaya</s1>, demanded that the sun should revolve round him in the same way as about <s1>Meru</s1>, which the sun declining to do, the <s1>Vindhya</s1> then began to elevate himself that he might bar the progress of both sun and moon;
the gods alarmed, asked the aid of the saint <s1>Agastya</s1>, who approached the <s1>Vindhya</s1> and requested that by bending down he would afford him an easy passage to the South country, begging at the same time that he would retain a low position till his return;
this he promised to do, but <s1>Agastya</s1> never returned, and the <s1>Vindhya</s1> range consequently never attained the elevation of the <s1>Himālaya</s1>), <ls>Mn.</ls>;
