<s>va/ruRa</s> ¦ <lex>m.</lex> (once in the <ls>TĀr.</ls> <s>varuRa/</s>) ‘All-enveloping Sky’, <ab>N.</ab> of an <s1>Āditya</s1> (in the <s1>Veda</s1> commonly associated with <s1>Mitra</s1> [<ab>q.v.</ab>] and presiding over the night as <s1>Mitra</s1> over the day, but often celebrated separately, whereas <s1>Mitra</s1> is rarely invoked alone;
<s1>Varuṇa</s1> is one of the oldest of the Vedic gods, and is commonly thought to correspond to the <gk>Οὐρανός</gk> of the Greeks, although of a more spiritual conception;
he is often regarded as the supreme deity, being then styled ‘king of the gods’ or ‘king of both gods and men’ or ‘king of the universe’;
no other deity has such grand attributes and functions assigned to him;
he is described as fashioning and upholding heaven and earth, as possessing extraordinary power and wisdom called <s>mAyA</s>, as sending his spies or messengers throughout both worlds, as numbering the very winkings of men's eyes, as hating falsehood, as seizing transgressors with his <s>pASa</s> or noose, as inflicting diseases, especially dropsy, as pardoning sin, as the guardian of immortality;
he is also invoked in the <s1>Veda</s1> together with <s1>Indra</s1>, and in later Vedic literature together with <s1>Agni</s1>, with <s1>Yama</s1>, and with <s1>Viṣṇu</s1>;
in <ls>RV. iv, 1, 2</ls>, he is even called the brother of <s1>Agni</s1>;
though not generally regarded in the <s1>Veda</s1> as a god of the ocean, yet he is often connected with the waters, especially the waters of the atmosphere or firmament, and in one place [<ls>RV. vii, 64, 2</ls>] is called with <s1>Mitra</s1>, <s>sinDu-pati</s>, ‘lord of the sea or of rivers’;
hence in the later mythology he became a kind of Neptune, and is there best known in his character of god of the ocean;
in the <ls>MBh.</ls> <s1>Varuṇa</s1> is said to be a son of <s1>Kardama</s1> and father of <s1>Puṣkara</s1>, and is also variously represented as one of the <s1>Deva-gandharva</s1>s, as a <s1>Nāga</s1>, as a king of the <s1>Nāga</s1>s, and as an <s1>Asura</s1>;
he is the regent of the western quarter [<ab>cf.</ab> <s>loka-pAla</s>] and of the <s1>Nakṣatra</s1> <s1>Śatabhiṣaj</s1> [<ls>VarBṛS.</ls>];
the <s1>Jaina</s1>s consider <s1>Varuṇa</s1> as a servant of the twentieth <s1>Arhat</s1> of the present <s1>Avasarpiṇī</s1>), <ls>RV.</ls> &c. &c. (<ab>cf.</ab> <ls>IW. 10</ls>; <ls n="IW.">12</ls> &c.)
