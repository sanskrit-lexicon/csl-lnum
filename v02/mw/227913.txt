he is said to have been called <s1>Sa-gara</s1>, as born together with a poison given to his mother by the other wife of his father;
he was father of <s1>Asamañja</s1> by <s1>Keśinī</s1> and of sixty thousand sons by <s1>Su-mati</s1>;
the latter were turned into a heap of ashes by the sage <s1>Kapila</s1> [see <s>BagIraTa</s>], and their funeral ceremonies could only be performed by the waters of <s1>Gaṅgā</s1> to be brought from heaven for the purpose of purifying their remains <pb n="1125,2"/>;
this was finally accomplished by the devotion of <s1>Bhagīratha</s1>, who having led the river to the sea, called it <s1>Sāgara</s1> in honour of his ancestor: <s1>Sagara</s1> is described as having subdued the <s1>Śaka</s1>s, <s1>Yavana</s1>s, and other barbarous tribes;
