¦ this, that, (this pronoun is enclitic and cannot begin a sentence; it is generally used alone, so that <s>enam puruzam</s>, ‘that man’, would be very unusual if not incorrect. Grammarians assert that the substitution of <s>enam</s> &c. for <s>imam</s> or <s>etam</s> &c. takes place when something is referred to which has already been mentioned in a previous part of the sentence; see <ls>Gr. 223</ls> and <ls n="Gr.">836</ls>)
