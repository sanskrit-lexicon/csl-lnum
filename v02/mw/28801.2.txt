¦ (opposed to <s>adas</s>, <ab>e.g.</ab> <s>ayaM lokaH</s> or <s>idaM viSvam</s> or <s>idaM sarvam</s>, this earthly world, this universe; <s>ayam agniH</s>, this fire which burns on the earth; but <s>asAv agniH</s>, that fire in the sky, <ab>i.e.</ab> the lightning: so also <s>idam</s> or <s>iyam</s> alone sometimes signifies ‘this earth’; <s>ime smaH</s>, here we are.) <s>idam</s> often refers to something immediately following, whereas <s>etad</s> points to what precedes (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>SrutvE<srs/>tad idam UcuH</s>, having heard that they said this). <s>idam</s> occurs connected with <s>yad</s>, <s>tad</s>, <s>etad</s>, <s>kim</s>, and a personal pronoun, partly to point out anything more distinctly and emphatically, partly pleonastically (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>tad idaM vAkyam</s>, this speech here following <pb n="165,3"/>; <s>so 'yaM vidUzakaH</s>, this <s1>Vidūṣaka</s1> here).
