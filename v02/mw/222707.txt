<s>SrAdDa</s> ¦ <lex>n.</lex> a ceremony in honour and for the benefit of dead relatives observed with great strictness at various fixed periods and on occasions of rejoicing as well as mourning by the surviving relatives (these ceremonies are performed by the daily offering of water and on stated occasions by the offering of <s1 slp1="piRqa">Piṇḍa</s1>s or balls of rice and meal [see <s>piRqa</s>] to three paternal and three maternal forefathers <ab>i.e.</ab> to father, grandfather, and great grandfather;
it should be borne in mind that a <s1 slp1="SrAdDa">Śrāddha</s1> is not a funeral ceremony [<s>antye<srs/>zwi</s>] but a supplement to such a ceremony;
it is an act of reverential homage to a deceased person performed by relatives, and is moreover supposed to supply the dead with strengthening nutriment after the performance of the previous funeral ceremonies has endowed them with ethereal bodies;
indeed until those <s>antye<srs/>zwi</s>, or ‘funeral rites’ have been performed, and until the succeeding first <s1 slp1="SrAdDa">Śrāddha</s1> has been celebrated the deceased relative is a <s>pre<srs/>ta</s> or restless, wandering ghost, and has no real body [only a <s>liNga-SarIra</s> <ab>q.v.</ab>];
it is not until the first <s1 slp1="SrAdDa">Śrāddha</s1> has taken place that he attains a position among the <s1 slp1="pitf">Pitṛ</s1>s or Divine Fathers in their blissful abode called <s1 slp1="pitf-loka">Pitṛ-loka</s1>, and the <ab n="Śrāddha" slp1="SrAdDa">Śr°</ab> is most desirable and efficacious when performed by a son;
