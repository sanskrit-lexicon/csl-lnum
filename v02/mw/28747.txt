<hom>2.</hom> <s>i/ti</s> ¦ <lex>ind.</lex> (<ab>fr.</ab> pronominal base <hom>3.</hom> <s>i</s>), in this manner, thus (in its original signification <s>i/ti</s> refers to something that has been said or thought, or lays stress on what precedes;
in the <s1>Brāhmaṇa</s1>s it is often equivalent to ‘as you know’, reminding the hearer or reader of certain customs, conditions, &c. supposed to be known to him). In quotations of every kind <s>i/ti</s> means that the preceding words are the very words which some person has or might have spoken, and placed thus at the end of a speech it serves the purpose of inverted commas (<s>i/ty uktvA</s>, having so said;
<s>i/ti kftvA</s>, having so considered, having so decided). It may often have reference merely to what is passing in the mind, <ab>e.g.</ab> <s>bAlo 'pi nA<srs/>vamantavyo manuzya i/ti BUmipaH</s>, a king, though a child, is not to be despised, saying to one's self, ‘he is a mortal’, (<ls>Gr. 928.</ls>) In <ab>dram.</ab> <s>i/ti taTA karoti</s> means ‘after these words he acts thus’.
<div n="p"/>Sometimes <s>i/ti</s> is used to include under one head a number of separate objects aggregated together (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>ijyA<srs/>DyayanadAnAni tapaH satyaM kzamA damaH . aloBa i/ti mArgo 'yam</s>, ‘sacrificing, studying, liberality, penance, truth, patience, self-restraint, absence of desire’, this course of conduct, &c.)
<div n="p"/><s>i/ti</s> is sometimes followed by <s>evam</s>, <s>iva</s>, or a demonstrative pronoun pleonastically (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>tAm brUyAd BavatI<srs/>ty evam</s>, her he may call ‘lady’, thus).
<div n="p"/><s>i/ti</s> may form an adverbial compound with the name of an author (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>i/ti-pARini</s>, thus according to <s1>Pāṇini</s1>). It may also express the act of calling attention (lo! behold!) It may have some other significations, <ab>e.g.</ab> something additional (as in <s>i/tyAdi</s>, et caetera), order, arrangement specific or distinctive, and identity. It is used by native commentators after quoting a rule to express ‘according to such a rule’ (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>anudAttaNita i/ty Atmanepadam Bavati</s>, according to the rule of <s1>Pāṇini</s1>, <ls n="Pāṇ.">i, 3, 12</ls>, the <s1>Ātmane-pada</s1> takes place).
<div n="p"/> <s>kim i/ti</s> = <s>kim</s>, wherefore, why? (In the <s1>Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa</s1> <s>ti</s> occurs for <s>i/ti</s>;
