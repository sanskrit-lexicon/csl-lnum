<s>ganDarva/</s> ¦ <s>as</s>, <lex>m.</lex> a <s1>Gandharva</s1> [though in later times the <s1>Gandharva</s1>s are regarded as a class, yet in <ls>RV.</ls> rarely more than one is mentioned;
he is designated as the heavenly <s1>Gandharva</s1> (<s>divya/ g°</s>, <ls>RV. ix, 86, 36</ls> and <ls n="RV.">x, 139, 5</ls>), and is also called <s1>Viśvā-vasu</s1> (<ls>RV. x, 85, 21</ls> and <ls n="RV. x, 85,">22</ls>; <ls n="RV. x,">139, 4</ls> and <ls n="RV. x, 139,">5</ls>)
and <s1>Vāyu-keśa</s1> (in <ab>pl.</ab> <ls>RV. iii, 38, 6</ls>);
his habitation is the sky, or the region of the air and the heavenly waters (<ls>RV. i, 22, 14</ls>; <ls n="RV.">viii, 77, 5</ls>; <ls n="RV.">ix, 85, 12</ls>; <ls n="RV. ix,">86, 36</ls>; <ls n="RV.">x, 10, 4</ls>; <ls>AV. ii, 2, 3</ls>);
his especial duty is to guard the heavenly <s1>Soma</s1> (<ls>RV. ix, 83, 4</ls> and <ls n="RV. ix,">85, 12</ls>), which the gods obtain through his intervention (<ls>RV.</ls>; <ls>AV. vii, 73, 3</ls>; <ab>cf.</ab> <ls>RV. i, 22, 14</ls>);
it is obtained for the human race by <s1>Indra</s1>, who conquers the <s1>Gandharva</s1> and takes it by force (<ls>RV. viii, 1, 11</ls> and <ls n="RV. viii,">77, 5</ls>);
the heavenly <s1>Gandharva</s1> is supposed to be a good physician, because the <s1>Soma</s1> is considered as the best medicine;
possibly, however, the word <s1>Soma</s1> originally denoted not the beverage so called, but the moon, and the heavenly <s1>Gandharva</s1> may have been the genius or tutelary deity of the moon;
in one passage (<ls>RV. ix, 86, 36</ls>) the heavenly <s1>Gandharva</s1> and the <s1>Soma</s1> are identified;
he is also regarded as one of the genii who regulate the course of the Sun's horses (<ls n="RV.">i, 163, 2</ls>; <ls n="RV.">x, 177, 2</ls>; <ab>cf.</ab> <ls n="RV. x,">135, 5</ls>);
he knows and makes known the secrets of heaven and divine truths generally (<ls n="RV.">x, 139, 5</ls> and <ls n="RV. x, 139,">6</ls>; <ls>AV. ii, 1, 2</ls>; <ls n="AV.">xx, 128, 3</ls>; <ls>VS. xi, 1</ls>; <ls n="VS.">xxxii, 9</ls>);
he is the parent of the first pair of human beings, <s1>Yama</s1> and <s1>Yamī</s1> (<ls>RV. x, 10, 4</ls>), and has a peculiar mystical power over women and a right to possess them (<ls>RV. x, 85, 21</ls> and <ls n="RV. x, 85,">22</ls>; <ls n="RV. x, 85,">40</ls> and <ls n="RV. x, 85,">41</ls>);
for this reason he is invoked in marriage ceremonies (<ls>AV. xiv, 2, 35</ls> and <ls n="AV. xiv, 2,">36</ls>);
ecstatic states of mind and possession by evil spirits are supposed to be derived from the heavenly <s1>Gandharva</s1> (<ab>cf.</ab> <s>-gfhIta</s>, <s>-graha</s>);
the <s1>Gandharva</s1>s as a class have the same characteristic features as the one <s1>Gandharva</s1>;
they live in the sky (<ls>RV.</ls>;
<ls>AV.</ls>;
<ls>ŚBr. xiv</ls>), guard the <s1>Soma</s1> (<ls>RV. ix, 113, 3</ls>;
<ls>ŚBr. iii</ls>;
<ls>AitBr. i, 27</ls>), are governed by <s1>Varuṇa</s1> (just as the <s1>Apsarasa</s1>s are governed by <s1>Soma</s1>), <ls>ŚBr. xiii</ls>;
<ls>ĀśvŚr. x, 7, 3</ls>, know the best medicines (<ls>AV. viii, 7, 23</ls>;
<ls>VS. xii, 98</ls>), regulate the course of the asterisms (<ls>AV. xiii, 1, 23</ls>;
<ls>BhP. iv, 29, 21</ls>;
hence twenty-seven are mentioned, <ls>VS. ix, 7</ls>), follow after women and are desirous of intercourse with them (<ls>AV.</ls>;
<ls>ŚBr. iii</ls>);
as soon as a girl becomes marriageable, she belongs to <s1>Soma</s1>, the <s1>Gandharva</s1>s, and <s1>Agni</s1> (<ls>Gṛhyās. ii, 19 f.</ls>;
<ls>Pañcat.</ls>;
<ls>Suśr.</ls>);
the wives of the <s1>Gandharva</s1>s are the <s1>Apsarasa</s1>s (<ab>cf.</ab> <s>ganDarvA<srs/>psara/s</s>), and like them the <s1>Gandharva</s1>s are invoked in gambling with dice (<ls>AV. vii, 109, 5</ls>);
they are also feared as evil beings together with the <s1>Rākṣasa</s1>s, <s1>Kimīdin</s1>s, <s1>Piśāca</s1>s, &c., amulets being worn as a protection against them (<ls>AV.</ls>;
<ls>Suśr.</ls>);
they are said to have revealed the <s1>Veda</s1>s to <s1>Vāc</s1> (<ls>ŚBr. iii</ls>;
<ab>cf.</ab> <ls>PārGṛ. ii, 12, 2</ls>), and are called the preceptors of the <s1>Ṛṣi</s1>s (<ls>ŚBr. xi</ls>);
<s1>Purūravas</s1> is called among them (<ls>ib.</ls>);
in epic poetry the <s1>Gandharva</s1>s are the celestial musicians or heavenly singers (<ab>cf.</ab> <ls>RV. x, 177, 2</ls>) who form the orchestra at the banquets of the gods, and they belong together with the <s1>Apsarasa</s1>s to <s1>Indra</s1>'s heaven, sharing also in his battles (<ls>Yājñ. i, 71</ls>;
<ls>MBh.</ls>;
<ls>Hariv.</ls> &c.;
<ab>cf.</ab> <ls>RTL. p. 238</ls>);
in the more systematic mythology the <s1>Gandharva</s1>s constitute one of the classes into which the higher creation is divided (<ab>i.e.</ab> gods, manes, <s1>Gandharva</s1>s, <ls>AV. xi, 5, 2</ls>;
or gods, <s1>Asura</s1>s, <s1>Gandharva</s1>s, men, <ls>TS. vii, 8, 25, 2</ls>;
<ab>cf.</ab> <ls>ŚBr. x</ls>;
or gods, men, <s1>Gandharva</s1>s, <s1>Apsarasa</s1>s, <s1>Sarpa</s1>s, and manes, <ls>AitBr. iii, 31, 5</ls>;
for other enumerations <ab>cf.</ab> <ls>Nir. iii, 8</ls>;
<ls>Mn. i, 37</ls> [<ls>RTL. p. 237</ls>] & <ls n="Mn.">iii, 196</ls>; <ls n="Mn.">vii, 23</ls>; <ls n="Mn.">xii, 47</ls>; <ls>Nal.</ls> &c.);
divine and human <s1>Gandharva</s1>s are distinguished (<ls>TUp. ii, 8</ls>;
the divine or <s1>Deva-Gandharva</s1>s are enumerated, <ls>MBh. i, 2550 ff.</ls> and <ls n="MBh. i,">4810 ff.</ls>);
another passage names 11 classes of <s1>Gandharva</s1>s (<ls>TĀr. i, 9, 3</ls>);
the chief or leader of the <s1>Gandharva</s1>s is named <s1>Citra-ratha</s1> (<ls>Bhag. x, 26</ls>);
they are called the creatures of <s1>Prajāpati</s1> (<ls>Mn. i, 37</ls>) or of <s1>Brahmā</s1> (<ls>Hariv. 11793</ls>) or of <s1>Kaśyapa</s1> (<ls n="Hariv.">11850</ls>) or of the <s1>Muni</s1>s (<ls>MBh. i, 2550</ls>;
<ls>Hariv. 11553</ls>) or of <s1>Prādhā</s1> (<ls>MBh. i, 2556</ls>) or of <s1>Ariṣṭā</s1> (<ls>Hariv. 234</ls>;
<ls>VP. i, 21</ls>) or of <s1>Vāc</s1> (<ls>PadmaP.</ls>);
with <s1>Jaina</s1>s the <s1>Gandharva</s1>s constitute one of the eight classes of the <s1>Vyantara</s1>s]<info lex="m"/>
