<s>viSva/-karman</s> ¦ <lex>m.</lex> ‘all-doer, all-creator, all-maker’, <ab>N.</ab> of the divine creative architect or artist (said to be son of <s1>Brahmā</s1>, and in the later mythology sometimes identified with <s1>Tvaṣṭṛ</s1> <ab>q.v.</ab>, he is said to have revealed the <s1>Sthāpatyaveda</s1> <ab>q.v.</ab>, or fourth <s1>Upa-veda</s1>, and to preside over all manual labours as well as the sixty-four mechanical arts [whence he is worshipped by <s1>Kāru</s1>s or artisans];
in the Vedic mythology, however, the office of Indian Vulcan is assigned to <s1>Tvaṣṭṛ</s1> as a distinct deity, <s1>Viśva-karman</s1> being rather identified with <s1>Prajā-pati</s1> [<s1>Brahmā</s1>] himself as the creator of all things and architect of the universe;
in the hymns, <ls>RV. x, 81</ls>; <ls n="RV. x,">82</ls> he is represented as the universal Father and Generator, the one all-seeing God, who has on every side eyes, faces, arms, and feet;
in <ls>Nir. x, 26</ls> and elsewhere in the <s1>Brāhmaṇa</s1>s he is called a son of <s1>Bhuvana</s1>, and <s1>Viśva-karman</s1> <s1>Bhauvana</s1> is described as the author of the two hymns mentioned above;
in the <ls>MBh.</ls> & <ls>Hariv.</ls> he is a son of the <s1>Vasu</s1> <s1>Prabhāsa</s1> and <s1>Yoga-siddhā</s1>;
in the <s1>Purāṇa</s1>s a son of <s1>Vāstu</s1>, and the father of <s1>Barhiṣmatī</s1> and <s1>Saṃjñā</s1>;
<ab>accord.</ab> to other authorities he is the husband of <s1>Ghṛtācī</s1>;
moreover, a doubtful legend is told of his having offered up all beings, including himself, in sacrifice;
the <s1>Rāmāyaṇa</s1> represents him as having built the city of <s1>Laṅkā</s1> for the <s1>Rākṣasa</s1>s, and as having generated the ape <s1>Nala</s1>, who made <s1>Rāma</s1>'s bridge from the continent to the island;
the name <s1>Viśva-karman</s1>, meaning ‘doing all acts’, appears to be sometimes applicable as an epithet to any great divinity), <ls>RV.</ls> &c. &c.<info lex="m"/>
