¦ <ab>N.</ab> of a brother of <s1>Rāvaṇa</s1> (his other brothers were <s1>Kubera</s1> [by a different mother] and <s1>Kumbha-karṇa</s1>;
both <s1>Rāvaṇa</s1> and <s1>Vibhīṣaṇa</s1> are said to have propitiated <s1>Brahmā</s1> by their penances, so that the god granted them both boons, and the boon chosen by <s1 n="Vibhīṣaṇa">V°</s1> was that he should never, even in the greatest calamity, stoop to any mean action;
hence he is represented in the <s1>Rāmāyaṇa</s1> as endeavouring to counteract the malice of his brother <s1>Rāvaṇa</s1>, in consequence of which he was so ill-treated by him that, leaving <s1>Laṅkā</s1>, he joined <s1>Rāma</s1>, by whom, after the death of <s1>Rāvaṇa</s1>, <s1 n="Vibhīṣaṇa">V°</s1> was placed on the throne of <s1>Laṅkā</s1>), <ls>MBh.</ls>;
