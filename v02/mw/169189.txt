<s>yajur—veda/</s> ¦ <lex>m.</lex> ‘the sacrificial <s1>Veda</s1>’, the collective body of sacred <s1>Mantra</s1>s or texts which constitute the <s1>Yajur-veda</s1> (these <s1>Mantra</s1>s, though often consisting of the prose <s1>Yajus</s1>, are frequently identical with the <s1>Mantra</s1>s of the <s1>Ṛg-veda</s1>, the <s1>Yajur-veda</s1> being only a sort of sacrificial prayer-book for the <s1>Adhvaryu</s1> priests formed out of the <s1>Ṛg-veda</s1>, which had to be dissected and rearranged with additional texts for sacrificial purposes;
the most characteristic feature of the <s1>Yajur-veda</s1> is its division into two distinct collections of texts, the <s1>Taittirīya-saṃhitā</s1> and the <s1>Vājasaneyi-saṃhitā</s1> <ab>q.v.</ab>;
the former of which is also called <s1>Kṛṣṇa</s1> <ab>i.e.</ab> ‘Black’, because in it the <s1>Saṃhitā</s1> and <s1>Brāhmaṇa</s1> portions are confused;
and the latter <s1>Śukla</s1> <ab>i.e.</ab> ‘White’, because in this, which is thought the more recent of the two recensions, the <s1>Saṃhitā</s1> is cleared from confusion with its <s1>Brāhmaṇa</s1> and is as it were white or orderly;
the order of sacrifices, however, of both recensions is similar, two of the principal being the <s1>Darśa-pūrṇa-māsa</s1> or sacrifice to be performed at new and full moon, and the <s1>Aśva-medha</s1> or horse-sacrifice;
