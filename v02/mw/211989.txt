it is perhaps the most modern of the <s1>Brāhmaṇa</s1>s, and is preserved in two <s1>Śākhā</s1>s or schools, <s1>Mādhyaṃdina</s1> and <s1>Kāṇva</s1>;
the version belonging to the former is best known, and is divided into fourteen <s1>Kāṇḍa</s1>s or books which contain one hundred <s1>Adhyāya</s1>s or lectures [or according to another arrangement into sixty-eight <s1>Prapāṭhaka</s1>s];
the whole work is regarded as the most systematic and interesting of all the <s1>Brāhmaṇa</s1>s, and though intended mainly for ritual and sacrificial purposes, is full of curious mythological details and legends;
