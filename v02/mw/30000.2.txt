¦ This particle may serve to give emphasis, like <s>id</s> and <s>eva</s>, especially after prepositions or demonstrative pronouns, in conjunction with <s>nu</s>, <s>vE</s>, <s>hi</s>, <s>cid</s>, &c. (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>aya/m u vAm puruta/mo</s> … <s>johavIti</s> [<ls>RV. iii, 62, 2</ls>], this very person [your worshipper] invokes you &c.) It is especially used in the figure of speech called Anaphora, and particularly when the pronouns are repeated (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>ta/m u stuza i/ndram ta/m gfRIze</s> [<ls>RV. ii, 20, 4</ls>], him I praise, <s1>Indra</s1>, him I sing). It may be used in drawing a conclusion, like the <lang>English</lang> ‘now’ (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>ta/d u ta/TA na/ kuryAt</s> [<ls>ŚBr. v, 2, 2, 3</ls>], that now he should not do in such a manner), and is frequently found in interrogative sentences (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>ka/ u ta/c ciketa</s> [<ls>RV. i, 164, 48</ls>], who, I ask, should know that?)<info lex="inh"/>
