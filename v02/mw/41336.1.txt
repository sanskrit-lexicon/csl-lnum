¦ The interrogative sentence introduced by <s>ka</s> is often terminated by <s>iti</s> (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>kasya sa putra iti kaTyatAm</s>, let it be said, ‘whose son is he?’), but <s>iti</s> may be omitted and the sentence lose its direct interrogative character (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>kasya sa putro na jYAyate</s>, it is not known whose son he is).
<s>ka</s> with or without √ <hom>1.</hom> <s>as</s> may express ‘how is it possible that?’ ‘what power have I, you, they, &c.?’ (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>ke mama Danvino'nye</s>, what can the other archers do against me? <s>ke AvAm paritrAtum</s>, what power have we to rescue you?)
<s>ka</s> is often connected with a demonstrative <ab>pron.</ab> (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>ko 'yam AyAti</s>, who comes here?) or with the potential (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>ko hariM nindet</s>, who will blame <s1>Hari</s1>?)
<s>ka</s> is sometimes repeated (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>kaH ko 'tra</s>, who is there? <s>kAn kAn</s>, whom? whom? <ab>i.e.</ab> which of them? <ab>cf.</ab> <ls>Gram. 54</ls>), and the repetition is often due to a kind of attraction (<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>kezAM kiM SAstram aDyayanIyam</s>, which book is to be read by whom? <ls>Gram. 836. a</ls>).
When <s>kim</s> is connected with the <ab>inst.</ab> <ab>c.</ab> of a noun or with the <ab n="indeclinable">indecl.</ab> participle it may express ‘what is gained by doing so, &c.?’ (= <s>ko'rTas</s>);
(<ab>e.g.</ab> <s>kiM vilambena</s>, what is gained by delay? <s>kim bahunA</s>, what is the use of more words? <s>Danena kiM yo na dadAti</s>, what is the use of wealth to him who does not give? with <ab>inst.</ab> and <ab>gen.</ab>, <s>nIrujaH kim OzaDEH</s>, what is the use of medicine to the healthy?)
