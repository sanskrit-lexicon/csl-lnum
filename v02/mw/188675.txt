he was the typical representative of <ns>Brāhmanical</ns> rank, and the legends of his conflict with <s1>Viśvā-mitra</s1>, who raised himself from the kingly or <s1>Kṣatriya</s1> to the <ns>Brāhmanical</ns> class, were probably founded on the actual struggles which took place between the <ns>Brāhmans</ns> and <s1>Kṣatriya</s1>s;
a great many hymns of the <ls>RV.</ls> are ascribed to these two great rivals;
those of the seventh <s1>Maṇḍala</s1>, besides some others, being attributed to <s1>Vasiṣṭha</s1>, while those of the third <s1>Maṇḍala</s1> are assigned to <s1>Viśvā-mitra</s1>;
in one of <s1>Vasiṣṭha</s1>'s hymns he is represented as king <s1>Su-dās</s1>'s family priest, an office to which <s1>Viśvā-mitra</s1> also aspired;
in another hymn <s1>Vasiṣṭha</s1> claims to have been inspired by <s1>Varuṇa</s1>, and in another [<ls>RV. vii, 33, 11</ls>] he is called the son of the <s1>Apsaras</s1> <s1>Urvaśī</s1> by <s1>Mitra</s1> and <s1>Varuṇa</s1>, whence his patronymic <s1>Maitrāvaruṇi</s1> <pb n="930,3"/>;
in <s1>Manu</s1>, <ls n="RV.">i, 35</ls>, he is enumerated among the ten <s1>Prajā-pati</s1>s or Patriarchs produced by <s1>Manu</s1> <s1>Svāyambhuva</s1> for the peopling of the universe;
in the <ls>MBh.</ls> he is mentioned as the family priest of the solar race or family of <s1>Ikṣvāku</s1> and <s1>Rāma-candra</s1>, and in the <s1>Purāṇa</s1>s as one of the arrangers of the <s1>Veda</s1>s in the <s1>Dvāpara</s1> age;
he is, moreover, called the father of <s1>Aurva</s1> [<ls>Hariv.</ls>], of the <s1>Sukālin</s1>s [<ls>Mn.</ls>], of seven sons [<ls>Hariv.</ls>; <ls>Pur.</ls>],
