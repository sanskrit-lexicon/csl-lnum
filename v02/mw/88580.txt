<s>trita/</s> ¦ <lex>m.</lex> ‘third’ (<gk>τρίτος</gk>), <ab>N.</ab> of a Vedic deity (associated with the <s1>Marut</s1>s, <s1>Vāyu</s1>, and <s1>Indra</s1>;
fighting like the latter with <s1>Trita</s1>, <s1>Vṛtra</s1>, and other demons;
called <s1>Āptya</s1> [<ab>q.v.</ab>], ‘water-deity’, and supposed to reside in the remotest regions of the world, whence [<ls>RV. viii, 47, 13</ls>-<ls n="RV. viii, 47,">15</ls>; <ls>AV.</ls>]
the idea of wishing to remove calamity to <s1 n="Trita">T°</s1>, and the view of the <s1>Trita</s1>s being the keepers of nectar [<ls>RV. vi, 44, 23</ls>], similarly, <ls>L.</ls> [<ls>RV. ii, 34, 10</ls>; <ls>TS. i</ls>; <ls>TBr. i</ls>]
the notion of <s1>Trita</s1>'s bestowing long life;
also conceived as an inferior deity conquering the demons by order and with the help of <s1>Indra</s1> [<ls>RV. ii</ls>; <ls n="RV.">viii, 52, 1</ls>; <ls n="RV.">x</ls>];
fallen into a well he begged aid from the gods [<ls n="RV.">i, 105, 17</ls>; <ls n="RV.">x, 8, 7</ls>];
as to this last myth, <ls>Sāy.</ls> on <ls n="RV.">i, 105</ls> relates that 3 <s1>Ṛṣi</s1>s, <s1>Ekata</s1>, <s1>Dvita</s1>, and <s1>Trita</s1>, parched with thirst, looked about and found a well, and when <s1 n="Trita">T°</s1> began to draw water, the other two, desirous of his property, pushed him down and closed up the well with a wheel;
shut up there, <s1 n="Trita">T°</s1> composed a hymn to the gods, and managed miraculously to prepare the sacrificial <s1>Soma</s1>, that he might drink it himself, or offer it to the deities and so be extricated: this is alluded to in <ls>RV. ix, 34, 4</ls> [<ab>cf.</ab> <ls n="RV. ix,">32, 2</ls>; <ls n="RV. ix,">38, 2</ls>; <ls n="RV. ix,">102, 2</ls>]
and described in <ls>MBh. ix, 2095</ls>;
also, <ls>Nir. iv, 6</ls> makes him a <s1>Ṛṣi</s1>, and he is the supposed author of <ls>RV. i, 105</ls>; <ls n="RV.">viii, 36</ls>; <ls n="RV.">ix, 33 f.</ls> and <ls n="RV. ix,">102</ls>; <ls n="RV.">x, 1</ls>-<ls n="RV. x,">7</ls>;
in epic legends [<ls>MBh. ix</ls>, <ls n="MBh.">xii f.</ls>] <s1>Ekata</s1>, <s1>Dvita</s1>, and <s1 n="Trita">T°</s1> are described as 3 brothers, sons of <s1>Gautama</s1> or of <s1>Prajā-pati</s1> or <s1>Brahmā</s1>;
elsewhere <s1 n="Trita">T°</s1> is one of the 12 sons of <s1>Manu</s1> <s1>Cākṣuṣa</s1> by <s1>Naḍvalā</s1>, <ls>BhP. iv, 13, 16</ls>;
