<s>kuntI</s> ¦ <lex>f.</lex> <ab>N.</ab> of <s1>Pṛthā</s1> (daughter of a <s1>Yādava</s1> prince named <s1>Śūra</s1> [or <s1>Vasu</s1>, <ls>Hariv. 5255</ls>], who gave her to his childless cousin <s1>Kunti</s1> or <s1>Kuntibhoja</s1>, by whom she was adopted;
she afterwards became one of the wives of <s1>Pāṇḍu</s1>;
on one occasion before her marriage she paid such respect to the powerful sage <s1>Durvāsas</s1> that he taught her an incantation or charm, by virtue of which she was to have a child by any god she liked to invoke;
out of curiosity she invoked the Sun, by whom she had a child, <ab>cf.</ab> <s>karRa</s>;
but the Sun afterwards restored to her her maidenhood;
soon after his marriage <s1>Pāṇḍu</s1> retired to the woods to indulge his passion for hunting;
there he killed a male and female deer, who turned out to be a <s1>Ṛṣi</s1> and his wife in the form of these animals;
the sage cursed <s1>Pāṇḍu</s1> and predicted that he would die in the embrace of one of his wives <pb n="291,2"/>;
hence <s1>Pāṇḍu</s1> lived apart from <s1>Kuntī</s1>, but with his approval she made use of her charm and had three sons, <s1>Yudhiṣṭhira</s1>, <s1>Bhīma</s1>, and <s1>Arjuna</s1>, by the three deities <s1>Dharma</s1>, <s1>Vāyu</s1>, and <s1>Indra</s1> respectively;
