NIKUMBHA VI¦. Another form of Gaṇapati. The
following story about him in the Nikumbha state is
told in Vāyu Purāṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Suyaśā, wife of Divodāsa used to worship in the
Nikumbha temple of Vārāṇasī for the sake of a child. As
the worship did not yield the desired effect, Divodāsa
smashed the idol in the temple into pieces. Then
Nikumbha cursed that Vārāṇasī should decline. As a
result of the curse the Hehayas like Tālajaṅgha and others
destroyed Vārāṇasī and drove Divodāsa away from
there. At last the Nikumbha temple was rebuilt and
Vārāṇasī became prosperous again.
