PRĀCĪNABARHIS¦. A prajāpati. (For genealogy see
under Pṛthu).
<div n="NI"/>Pṛthu got two sons named Antardhāna and Vādī who
were very virtuous. A son named Havirdhāna was
born to Antardhāna of his wife Śikhaṇḍinī. Dhiṣaṇā
born of the family of Agni became the wife of Havir-
dhāna and they got six sons named Prācīnabarhis,
Śukra, Gaya, Kṛṣṇa, Vraja and Ajina. Of these Prācīna-
barhis became a great Prajāpati. He carpeted the world
with darbha grass with its head turned towards the
east and thus got the name (Prācī = east; barhis = bed
of Kuśa grass) Prācīnabarhis. He performed great
penance and married Savarṇā, daughter of the oceans.
They got ten sons who were called Pracetases and who were
all masters of dhanurveda (archery). They all perform-
ed penance for ten thousand years lying submerged
in water. Brahmā persuaded Prācīnabarhis to request
his sons to refrain from remaining unmarried. Prācīna-
barhis informed his sons about Brahmā's wish. They
sat in meditation in the ocean for ten thousand years
as per directions from their father and sang songs in
praise of Viṣṇu. Mahāviṣṇu was pleased and he gave
darśana (vision of god) to them on the surface of the
ocean itself with the brilliance of blue lotus. Pracetases
went into ecstasy when they saw Bhagavān coming to
them riding on the back of Garuḍa and they bowed
down in great devotion before him. Mahāviṣṇu asked
them what they wanted and they reported they wanted
a boon for the progress and prosperity of the prajās.
Granting them the boon Mahāviṣṇu disappeared
and the Pracetases went back to their father. (Chapter
14, Aṃśa 1, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
