<F>1) Yenāyoji na veśma sthiram arthavidhau vivekinā jinaveśma/ Sa jayatāṃ ravikīrtiḥ kavitāśrita-Kālidāsa-Bhāravikīrtiḥ.//</F> The theme of Kirātār-
junīya is Śiva, in the guise of a hunter, attacking Arjuna
immersed in penance. Bhāravi's literary style is simple
and sweet. In the use of similes he is second only to
Kālidāsa. Among his books only Kirātārjunīya has been
found out yet.
