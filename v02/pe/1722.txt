DAṆḌADHARA III¦. A king who helped the Pāṇḍavas.
Very often the name Maṇimān also occurs along with
the name of Daṇḍadhara. They might have been bro-
thers or sons of the same father by separate mothers.
In the Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 186, Stanza 7,
mention is made that these two had been present at the
marriage of Draupadī. Droṇācārya killed both of them
in the battle of Bhārata. (M.B. Karṇa Parva, Chapter
6, Stanza 13).
