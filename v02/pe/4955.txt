PAÑCAJA I¦. (PAÑCAJANA). A mighty asura. This
asura lived inside a conch. Śrī Kṛṣṇa killed this asura.
<div n="NI"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadrarāma were having their
education in the āśrama of the sage Sāndīpani. On the
eve of their completing their education an asura
named Pañcaja carried away the son of the sage while
the child was bathing in the Prabhāsatīrtha and kept
him inside a conch where the asura lived. The sage,
greatly griefstricken asked his disciples to get him back
his son as his Gurudakṣiṇā (fees for the preceptor).
Accordingly Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma went to the
banks of the river and prayed to Varuṇa. Varuṇa
appeared before them and then they told him about
the mishap. With the help of Varuṇa they killed the
asura Pañcaja and got back the son of their guru. The
conch in which the asura lived was taken by Kṛṣṇa.
Because the conch belonged to Pañcaja the conch got
the name Pāñcajanya. (10th Skandha, Bhāgavata).
