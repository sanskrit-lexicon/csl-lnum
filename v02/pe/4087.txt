MĀGHA¦. A month (February). This is so called be-
cause it is closely associated with the constellation
Maghā. This month is between the months of Pauṣa and
Phālguna. Mahābhārata makes some statements about
the importance of the month of Māgha.
<div n="NI"/>(i) He who bathes at Prayāga during this month will
be free from all sins. (Śloka 37, Chapter 25, Anuśāsana
Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) He who gives gingelly as gift to Brahmins during
this month will never go to hell. (Śloka 8, Chapter 66,
Anuśāsana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) If one takes food only once a day during the whole
of this month one will be born very rich in the next
birth. (Śloka 31, Chapter 106, Anuśāsana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) If one worships Śrī Kṛṣṇa fasting on the Dvādaśī
day of Māgha one will get the benefit of conducting a
Rājasūya yajña. (Śloka 5, Chapter 109, Anuśāsana
Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(v) Bhīṣma expressed his desire to Kṛṣṇa to end his
life on the aṣṭamī day falling in the bright fortnight
of the month of Māgha. (Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter
167, Śloka 28).
