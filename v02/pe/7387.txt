<div n="NI"/>If the dreams mentioned above are seen it should
not be mentioned to anybody. After the dream, either
he should sleep again or take bath. To counteract
the effects of bad dreams, do one of the following
such as offering sesame as oblation in fire; worship-
ping Viṣṇu or Śiva, or the Sun or Gaṇeśvara; sing-
ing hymns of praise; reciting sūktas (verses) such
as Puruṣasūkta etc. The dreams seen in; the first
watch of the night will come into effect within one
year; dreams seen in the second watch of
the night will take effect within six months;
those seen in the third watch of the night
will take effect within three months and those seen
in the fourth watch of the night will take effect within
half a month and those seen at dawn will be realized
within ten days. If a bad dream and a good dream
are seen in one night, the last one will take effect. So
it is better not to sleep any more in the night after
seeing a good dream.
