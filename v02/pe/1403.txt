CAMASODBHEDA¦. A holy place in Saurāṣṭra which
forms part of the very reputed sacred place called
Vināśana. It is said that it was here that the river
Sarasvatī which once became invisible, was detected. A
bath here is as efficacious as performing the Jyotiṣṭoma
yajña. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 82, Verse 112).
