URVAŚĪ I¦. A famous celestial damsel.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth of Urvaśī.%} In days of old two hermits named Nara
and Nārāyaṇa did penance to Brahmā in the holy her-
mitage of Badarikā for a thousand years. (Nara and
Nārāyaṇa were the children born to Dharma, the son of
Brahmā). Because of the severity of their penance Indra
was struck with fear. Thinking that they were doing
this severe penance with a view to become Indra, he
approached the hermits and told them that they might
ask for any boon. Even though Indra told them several
times, they did not speak a word nor did they make any
stir. Indra's fear increased. So Indra decided to create
some delusions which would arouse in them fear, desire
etc., so that their penance might be broken. He began
to bring around them wild animals such as lion, elephant
wild snake etc. and natural phenomena such as storm,
[Page811-b+ 64]
heavy rain, forest-fire etc. to terrify them. The efforts
of Indra were futile. The disappointed Indra sent for
Kāmadeva (Cupid) and consulted him, as a result of
which Kāmadeva and his wife Ratidevī with many
celestial maids came to the hermitage in the mountain
of Gandhamādana with the intention of hindering the
penance of Naranārāyaṇas. The season of spring was
created in the forest. The celestial women such as
Rambhā and others came before the hermits and began
to sing and dance. The hearts of the hermits began to
swell with passion. When they opened their eyes what
they saw was a beautiful sight. The famous celestial
women, Menakā, Rambhā, Tilottamā, Sukeśinī, Mano-
ramā, Maheśvarī, Puṣpagandhā, Pramadvarā, Ghṛtācī,
Candraprabhā, Somā, Vidyunmālā, Ambujākṣī, Kāñca-
namālā, and others with their ten thousand and eighty
hand-maids stood before them. Hermit Nārāyaṇa who
got terribly angry struck on his thigh with his hand
and instantly there arose a woman of extreme beauty.
Because she had originated from the Ūru (thigh) of
Nārāyaṇa, that woman, who was the most beautiful
in the three worlds, got the name Urvaśī. All the others
were struck with wonder at the sight of this new creat-
ion. After that so many other beautiful women also
were created. The hermit Nārāyaṇa gave all of them
to Indra. With shame Indra accepted them and return-
ed to heaven along with them. Thus Urvaśī arrived
at the realm of the devas (gods). (Devī Bhāgavata,
Skandha 4).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Position of Urvaśī.%} It is mentioned in Mahābhārata
that Urvaśī had the eleventh place among the singers.
The expert dancers were Anūcānā, Adrikā, Somakeśī,
Miśrā, Alambuṣā, Marīci, Śucikā, Vidyutparṇā, Tilot-
tamā, Ambikā, Kṣemā, Rambhā, Subāhu, Asitā,
Supriyā, Puṇḍarīkā, Sugandhā, Surasā, Pramāthinī,
Kāmyā and Śāradvatī. Urvaśī got the first place among
the celestial maids in beauty. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter
123).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Urvaśī and Purūravas.%} Purūravas was the son of Budha
born of Ilā. He grew up and became a king of great
renown. His fame reached even the realm of the gods.
One day during that period Brahmā cursed Urvaśī. “Go
and be born on the earth.” (It is stated in the Devī
Bhāgavata that it was Brahmā who cursed Urvaśī and in
the Bhāgavata that it was the Mitrāvaruṇas who cursed
Urvaśī). Urvaśī had heard about the fame of Purūravas
and had felt tender love for him. The celestial maid
reached the earth. She went to the palace of Purūravas
and saw him. Because of the perfection of their figures,
both loved mutually. The king asked her to become
his wife. She agreed. But she laid down three conditions.
<div n="NI"/>(i) I have with me two lambs which I bring up as my
sons. You must take care of them. No harm should
befall them.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) I take in only ghee. On no account should you
compel me to eat any other food.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Don't come near me in nudity except at the time
of coition.
<div n="NI"/>The king agreed to all these conditions. From that day
onwards Urvaśī lived in the palace of the king as his
wife. They lived happily for a long while without
separating from each other.
<div n="NI"/>Urvaśī became conspicuous by her absence in the realm
of the gods. She was the most expert actress in heaven.
[Page812-a+ 65]
Indra missed her. So a search was made and they found
out that she was in the palace of Purūravas. Indra
asked the Gandharvas to bring that celestial woman to
heaven somehow. Viśvāvasu and some others of the
Gandharvas reached the palace of king Purūravas and
waited for an opportunity. One midnight they stole
the lambs and took them away through the sky. At
that time the king was with Urvaśī in the harem.
Urvaśī heard the cry of the lambs and she was flurried.
She reviled the king who was not capable of taking care
of two lambs. Hearing her harsh words the king took
his bow and arrow and following the cry of the lambs
he was about to chase the thieves. Taking this oppor-
tunity the Gandharvas caused a lightning to flash in the
king's harem. In the light of the lightning Urvaśī saw
the king standing nude. The Gandharvas having achi-
eved their task had left the lambs and departed before
the king had got out of the room. The king caught
hold of the lambs and returned to the harem, within a
short while. But Urvaśī had gone out of the palace
and was on her way.
<div n="NI"/>The king was full of grief. He wandered all over the
country in search of Urvaśī. At last he reached Kuru-
kṣetra and saw Urvaśī there. He bowed low before
her and implored her to return to the palace. But
Urvaśī replied thus:—
<div n="NI"/>“Women are like wolves. Don't have alliance with them
Oh King! Kings should not put faith in women and
thieves.”
<div n="NI"/>Saying thus, Urvaśī vanished. (Devī Bhāgavata,
Skandha 1).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The reason why Purūravas had to remain separate from Urvaśī.%}
Purūravas had once gone to heaven, in accordance with
the invitation of Indra to help the Gods in the battle
with the asuras. Indra had killed Māyādhara, a noble
Asura, in that battle and had celebrated a festival. In
that festival Rambhā was dancing before Tumburu, the
sage-priest, and detecting some flaw in her dance Purū-
ravas teased her. Rambhā retorted by asking the King
what he knew about dance, and the king replied that he
had learned from Urvasī more dance than Tumburu the
teacher of Rambhā. Tumburu got angry at this, and
cursed the king Purūravas to suffer from the pangs of
separation from Urvaśī. Stricken with grief, Purūravas
returned to his palace. It was after this that the Gan-
dharvas took away Urvaśī. Purūravas went to Badari-
kāśrama and performed penance, meditating on God
Viṣṇu for the nullification of the curse. Urvaśī, aggri-
eved by separation from her husband, sat motionless as
a picture, in the custody of the Gandharvas. Lord Viṣṇu
was pleased with the penance of Purūravas. The Gan-
dharvas brought her back to the King. Thus it became
possible for the king to meet Urvaśī at least once a year.
(Kathāsaritsāgara, Lāvāṇakalambaka, Taraṅga 1).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The sons born to Purūravas by Urvaśī.%} The king became
very sad when Urvaśī was about to depart from him at
Kurukṣetra. Seeing his grief Urvaśī told him. “Oh
King, if you want so much to live with me, you have to
worship the Gandharvas. They will be pleased and
will give me to you. Don't be sorry. Now I am preg-
nant. Come to this place at the end of a year. We
can spend that night together. Then we will get another
son also that night.” Pleased at what Urvaśī had
said, the king returned to his palace. On completion
of a year Purūravas went to Kurukṣetra and spent a
[Page812-b+ 65]
night with Urvaśī. Urvaśī gave Purūravas a very
beautiful child and then she vanished. The king sat
there and praised the Gandharvas, who gave the king
an Agnisthālī (a fire pot). Because of his derangement,
thinking it to be Urvaśī the king took the sthālī (pot)
and wandered about in the forest. At last placing the
pot in the forest, the king returned to his palace. On
that day Tretāyuga (one of the four ages of the word)
commenced, and the Vedas dawned in his mind as
three in number. He returned to the place where
he had left the Sthālī in the forest and took it. After
that he made two ‘araṇis’ (wood from which fire is
kindled by attrition) out of a banyan tree and placed his
body between them and made fire. That fire is called
‘Jātavedas.’ Thus Jātavedas became the son of
Purūravas.
<div n="NI"/>Purūravas generated three fires from Jātavedas. The
first of them is Praṇava. The second is called Nārāyaṇa
and the third Agnivarṇa. (Śrīmad Bhāgavata, 9th
Śkandha).
<div n="NI"/>To Purūravas six sons were born from the womb of
Urvaśī. They were Āyus, Śrutāyus, Satyāyus, Raya,
Vijaya and Jaya. (A little difference is observed in these
names in the Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 75,
Stanzas 24 and 25).
<div n="NI"/>6) To know how a Gandharva named Durmada and
a Vidyādharī named Unmadā played a trick on Purū-
ravas and Urvaśī, see under Unmadā.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%How Agastya and Vasiṣṭha were born to Mitrāvaruṇas be-%}
{%cause of Urvaśī.%} In days of old there was a renowned
king named Nimi in the family of Ikṣvāku. He decided
to perform a sacrifice of a long duration. He began
preparation and invited famous hermits such as Bhṛgu,
Aṅgiras, Vāmadeva, Pulastya, Pulaha. Ṛcīka and others.
Finally he invited Vasiṣṭha. At that time Indra had
begun another sacrifice in heaven. So Vasiṣṭha went to
heaven for that sacrifice, telling Nimi that he would
conduct the sacrifice on his return. The emperor Nimi
did not like it. Recognizing the hermit Gautama as
the main priest, he began performing the sacrifice.
The sacrifice of Indra lasted for 500 years. When Vasiṣ-
ṭha returned after that, the sacrifice of Nimi was over.
Vasiṣṭha cursed Nimi. “You will become devoid of
body.” Nimi cursed back. “Let Vasiṣṭha also become
thus.”
<div n="NI"/>The aggrieved Vasiṣṭha went to his father Brahmā and
complained about the curse. Brahmā told Vasiṣṭha.
“You penetrate the brightness of Mitrāvaruṇas and
stay there. In due course you will get a birth which is
not of a womb.” Hearing these words, Vasiṣṭha reached
the hermitage of Mitrāvaruṇas. He left his body there
and fused himself into their effulgence. During this
period Urvaśī came to that hermitage. Seeing her,
Mitrāvaruṇas had seminal flow. The semen fell in a
pot. From the pot two bright and handsome sons were
born. The first of them was Agastya and the second
Vasiṣṭha. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 8).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Indra cursing Urvaśī.%} Once Agastya went to the dur-
bar of Indra. On the occasion Indra asked Urvaśī to
dance. In the midst of the dance she saw Jayanta, the
son of Indra, and became amorous and her steps went
wrong. Nārada who was playing his famous lute called
Mahatī could not play well. Agastya got angry and
cursed Jayanta to become a bud. He cursed Nārada
also. So his lute became the lute of the world. Urvaśī
[Page813-a+ 65]
was born on the earth under the name Mādhavī due to
the curse.

Arjuna).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Other information.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) It is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Sabhā Parva,
Chapter 10, Stanza 11, that Urvaśī had been in love
with Kubera once.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Urvaśī was dismayed when Śukadeva attained Sup-
reme Bliss. (See under Śuka).
