BHṚṄGĪ¦. A Maharṣi who was a devotee of Śiva. Once
he went to Kailāsa and began to go round Śiva to pay
homage to him. But since Pārvatī and Śiva were sitting
together as one body, he could not go round Śiva sepa-
rately. He did not have much reverence for Pārvatī.
So he took the form of a female beetle (Bhṛṅgī) and
bored his way through a hole made in the place where
their bodies were united and thus went round Śiva alone.
Pārvatī was angry at this slight shown to her and cursed
him to become physically weak. His legs became so
weak that they were unable to support his body. So
he prayed to Śiva again and he blessed him with a third
leg. In this way Bhṛṅgī became a Maharṣi with three
legs. (Maharṣis).
