SAUTI¦. A famous son of hermit Romaharṣaṇa. The
real name of this son was Ugraśravas. This teacher is
responsible for the arrangement of the Mahābhārata.
in the form that we see today.
<div n="NI"/>The story of Mahābhārata composed by Vyāsa and
Vaiśampāyana contained only a graphic description of
the battle of Bhārata. No vivid description of Śrī
Kṛṣṇa born of the Yādava dynasty and of the Yādavas,
was given in it. To remove this deficiency, Sauti
added an appendix called ‘Harivaṃśa’ to Svargārohaṇa
Parva in Mahābhārata. (For further details see under
Bhārata I).
