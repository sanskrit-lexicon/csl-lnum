JĀBĀLI I¦. A famous hermit. In Mahābhārata, Anu-
śāsana Parva, Chapter 4, Stanza 55, it is stated that
Jābāli was one of the sons of Viśvāmitra. They
were expounders of the Vedas. Though he was the son
of Viśvāmitra his life was mostly connected with Va-
siṣṭha. The Purāṇas do not make it clear how this son
of Viśvāmitra happened to fall into the circle of Vasi-
ṣṭha who was a foe of Viśvāmitra. He was one of the
seven spiritual advisers of King Daśaratha. It is men-
tioned in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, Sarga 48 that
eight hermits such as Suyajña, Vāmadeva, Jābāli,
Kaśyapa Vasiṣṭha and others lived in Ayodhyā in the
palace of the King Daśaratha.
<div n="NI"/>When Bharata went to the forest, to bring Śrī Rāma
back to Ayodhyā, Jābāli also followed him. Jābāli
argued with Śrī Rāma, using several arguments, to make
him return to Ayodhyā. These arguments made Śrī
Rāma angry. But he was pacified by the consoling words
of Vasiṣṭha. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>Jābāli comes in the line of disciples of Vyāsa. Vyāsa
divided the Veda and taught Sumantu Atharvaveda.
The hermit Sumantu first taught Atharvaveda to his
disciple Kabandha who divided it into two parts and
taught two disciples Devadarśa, and Pathya. The disci-
[Page335-b+ 65]
ples of Devadarśa were Magadha, Brahmabali, Saut-
kāyani and Pippalāda. Pathya had three disciples.
They were Jābāli, Kumuda and Śaunaka. Of these
Jābāli was a famous expounder of Atharvaveda. (Viṣṇu
Purāṇa, Aṃśa 3).
