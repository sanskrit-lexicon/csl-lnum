PAÑCANADA I¦. A land of the north-western side of
Bhārata. This is at present called the Punjab. When
Nakula conquered the western states he conquered
Pañcanada also. (Śloka 11, Chapter 32, Mahābhārata).
Five rivers of names Vipāśā (Vyāsa), Śatadrū (Sutlej),
Irāvatī (Rāvī), Cndrabhāgā (Chenab) and Vitastā
(Jhelum) run through this place and that is why the
place is called Pañcanada.
