YAYĀTI¦. An eminent king of the Lunar dynasty.
<div n="NI"/>1.) {%Genealogy and Birth.%} From Viṣṇu were descended
in the following order—Brahmā—Atri—Candra—Budha
-Purūravas—Āyus—Nahuṣa—Yayāti.
<div n="NI"/>Sage Atri had three sons—Candra, Durvāsas and Dattā-
treya—by his wife Anasūyā. Candra's son was Budha,
Budha's son was Purūravas, Purūravas's son was Āyus,
Āyus's son was Nahuṣa who had six sons—Yati, Yayāti,
Saṃyāti, Āyāti, Ayati and Dhruva. Yayāti had two
wives, Devayānī and Śarmiṣṭhā. Two sons, Yadu and
Turvasu, were born to Devayāni. Of them, Yadu became
the founder of Yaduvaṃśa. Śarmiṣṭhā had three sons
who were Druhyu, Anudruhyu and Pūru. The Puru-
vaṃśa traces its origin to Puru.
<div n="NI"/>2). {%Yayāti's marriage.%} Yayāti married Devayānī, the
daughter of sage Śukra and Śarmiṣṭhā, the daughter of
Vṛṣaparvā.
<div n="NI"/>There is a story behind this marriage, given in Mahā-
bhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 76.
[Page896-b+ 64]
Once there was keen rivalry between Devas and Asuras.
For achieving victory Devas accepted Bṛhaspati and
Asuras accepted Śukra as their preceptors. Although
Devas slaughtered all Asuras they were restored to life
by Śukra by the power of his mantra. Devas and Asuras
resumed their battle. “Mṛtasañjīvanī” (the art of revi-
ving the dead) was then unknown to the gods. Devas
sent the handsome youth Kaca to Śukra, to learn
Mṛtasañjīvanī from him. There, Kaca fell in love with
Devayānī, Śukra's daughter. But after acquiring the
knowledge about Mṛtasañjīvanī he returned, without
marrying Devayānī. At the time of his departure, Kaca
and Devayānī cursed each other. Devayānī's curse was
that Kaca's newly acquired knowledge would not
produce the desired result, while Kaca's curse was that
Devayānī would not be married by any youthful ṛṣi.
<div n="NI"/>Śarmiṣṭhā was the daughter of Vṛṣaparvā, the Daitya
king. Devayānī was the daughter of Śukra, the Daitya
preceptor. One day they were enjoying a bath in a
forest brook with their maids, after leaving their clothes
on the bank of the stream. At that time Devendra who
came that way, transformed himself into a strong wind
and carried all the clothes to a place and put all of
them in a heap. Seeing this, the women rushed out of
the water and in the hurried confusion in snatching
their garments Devayānī and Śarmiṣṭhā happened to
put on each other's clothes. A quarrel took place bet-
ween them on this mistake and the angry Śarmiṣṭhā
pushed Devayānī into an unused well. Thinking that
Devayānī was dead, Śarmiṣṭhā and her maids went to
the palace.
<div n="NI"/>At this time, Yayāti who was a king of the lunar dynasty
happened to come there exhausted after his hunting.
After rescuing Devayānī from the well and enquiring
about her identity and the circumstances in which she
fell into the well, he returned to his palace
<div n="NI"/>Devayānī sent her maid Ghūrṇikā to her father and in-
formed him about her mishap. The father, sage Śukra
became angry towards Vṛṣaparvā, and came down from
Daityaloka and settled down in the forest with his dau-
ghter. Afraid of his preceptor's curse and anger, Vṛṣa-
parvā came to Śukra and offered profuse apologies to him
for his daughter's misconduct. But Śukra answered
that he would be prepared to forgive only if Śarmiṣṭhā
with 1000 maids would go and serve Devayānī. Finding
no other way, Vṛṣaparvā yielded to the condition. Soon
Śarmiṣṭhā and her 1000 maids went to the forest and
began to serve Devayānī. Śukra returned to Daityaloka.
Some time after this, Yayāti came to the forest one day
for hunting. There he met Devayānī, being attended
by many maids. In the conversation that followed, Deva-
yānī was able to recognize Yayāti. She fell in love with
him. But Yayāti insisted that he was not prepared to
marry her without the consent of Śukrācārya. So she
sent one of her maids to her father and informed him of
her desire. The sage readily agreed and had their
marriage performed. He also presented them 1,000
maids. After the ceremony, Yayāti returned to his
palace with his bride. Śarmiṣṭhā and the 2,000
maids also accompanied them. (M.B. Ādi Parva,
Chapters 76-81).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Yayāti's domestic Life.%} After his arrival in his capital
city, Yayāti made arrangements for Devayānī's residence
in his own palace while Śarmiṣṭhā took up her residence
[Page897-a+ 65]
in Aśokavanikā. In due course, Devayānī gave birth to
a son. The sight of the child roused the motherly inst-
incts of Śarmiṣṭhā who spent a thousand years in heart-
burning. One day, while she was brooding alone in her
garden, Yayāti happened to come there. As they met,
their hearts were moved by tender feelings. Śarmiṣṭhā
approached Yayāti and begged for a son. But he tried
to evade her by pleading that it was not proper to do
anything in violation of Dharma. But in the end, he
had to yield to her earnest supplications and philosophical
arguments. Thus Śarmiṣṭhā conceived a son in secret.
<div n="NI"/>When the child was born and it grew up, Devayānī's
mind was constantly vexed with the thought as to who
was the father. Once in an angry mood she questioned
Śarmiṣṭhā herself about it. She answered that the
child's father was a sage whose identity she could not
ascertain in the excitement of her union with him. Any
way, this answer satisfied Devayānī.
<div n="NI"/>Soon after, another son was born to Devayānī. The
first boy was named Yadu and the second son, Turvasu.
As a result of the secret relations between Yayāti and
Śarmiṣṭhā, three boys were born to her and they were
named Druhyu, Anudruhyu and Pūru, respectively.
These boys also grew up in Aśokavanikā.
<div n="NI"/>Once Devayānī was in her garden with her husband
and children. Just then, Śarmiṣṭhā's children also
happened to come there. Devayānī who somehow had
her own suspicions, enquired of them their parentage
and the innocent children replied that their mother was
Śarmiṣṭhā and their father was Yayāti. Devayānī who
became furious, immediately went to Asuraloka and
informed her father Śukra about it. On hearing it, the
sage who was beside himself with anger owing to his
paternal affection, cursed Yayāti so that he fell a victim
to the infirmities of old age. Yayāti entreated Śukra to
withdraw the curse since he had not enjoyed his youth
to the full.
<div n="NI"/>Śukra lifted the curse by assuring him that one of
Yayāti's sons would accept his father's old age in ex-
change for his youth and the son would be crowned
King after Yayāti. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapters 82 and
83).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Rejuvenation.%} Yayāti asked his eldest son Yadu for
his youthfulness. But the latter was not prepared to
exchange it for his father's old age. Next the father
approached his younger sons, Turvasu, Druhyu, and
Anudruhyu, with the same request, but all of them
in turn refused to oblige him. Even though Yayāti
promised to return the youthfulness to them after a
thousand years, they refused to exchange it for his old
age. Yayāti in his anger, cursed Yadu that his progeny
would never become Kings. Turvasu's family would be
completely destroyed and Druhyu would float down the
river, with unfulfilled desires and faded prosperity. Pūru
wholeheartedly accepted his father's old age in exchange
for his youth and went to the forest. From that day
Yayāti began his reign with a cheerful heart. (M.B.
Ādi parva, Chapters 84 and 85).
<div n="NI"/>In Padma Purāṇa, there is a slightly different version
about the way in which Yayāti fell a victim to the in-
firmities of old age. It is as follows:—Seeing the rigorous
observance of Yayāti's virtuous life, Devendra began to
be alarmed at the thought that he might be dislodged
from his place. He called his charioteer Mātali and
ordered him to bring Yayāti with him to Indraloka.
[Page897-b+ 65]
When Mātali failed in his mission, Devendra sent some
Gandharvas to enact the drama of “Vāmanāvatāra”
before Yayāti. Enchanted by the charm and perform-
ance of Rati on the stage, the King became irresistibly
fascinated by the female sex.
<div n="NI"/>Once the Rākṣasī named Jarā and Madana got access
to Yayāti's body. While in that state, one day he went
to the forest for hunting. There he happened to meet
a beautiful girl named “Aśrubindumatī”. From her
companion-maid, Viśālā, the King came to know of her
history. Viśālā said to Yayāti—“Long ago when Kāma-
deva was burnt Rati was in deep grief. The gods were
moved to pity by her tears and they restored Kāma to
life. Rati who was extremely happy, began to shed
tears of joy. A beautiful girl was born from the tears
which fell from her left eye. This maid who is standing
before you is that girl. She is now looking for a suitable
person for her Svayaṃvara.” On hearing this story the
King expressed his desire to marry her. Aśrubindumatī
agreed to become his wife on condition that he exchang-
ed his old age with some young person for his youth-
fulness.
<div n="NI"/>Yayāti returned to his palace and asked each of his sons
to give him his youth. Pūru alone fulfilled his father's
desire. After this Yayāti married Aśrubindumatī. But he
was compelled to submit to another condition also, that
he should not maintain any contact with his other wives.
Devayānī and Śarmiṣṭhā naturally, became distressed
and furious when they saw Yayāti and Aśrubindumatī
as husband and wife. So Yayāti asked Yadu to kill both
of them. But Yadu refused to obey him. Yayāti who
became angry at this, cursed his son that one of his
descendants would marry his uncle's daughter and
become heir to his mother's wealth.
<div n="NI"/>After some time, on Menakā's advice, Aśrubindumatī
urged Yayāti to go on a visit to Heaven. So he entrust-
ed his kingdom to Pūru and went to Vaikuṇṭha.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Yayāti's reign.%} The Purāṇas describe Yayāti as a
noble and eminent King. Some of the events which took
place during his reign and which deserve special praise,
are given below:
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Gift of cows.%} Once when King Yayāti was in the
company of his subjects, a Brāhmaṇa approached him
with a request for Gurudakṣiṇā. At once Yayāti gave
him a gift of 1,000 cows. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter
195).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Yayāti and Gālava.%} See para 6 under Gālava.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%His end.%} After a thousand years, Yayāti handed
over his kingship to Pūru and went to the forest. He
spent many years living in Bhṛgutuṅga in the company
of sages, and feeding on fruits, roots, etc. and in the end
died in the forest and attained Heaven.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%Yayāti's fall from Heaven.%} Yayāti remained in Heaven
for many years. Once he insulted the Devas, Indra and
other gods and kings in the divine assembly. The gods
looked at one another, wondering who this proud fellow
was. They asked how this man reached Heaven without
renouncing his pride. In the meantime Yayāti lost his
balance and fell down from Heaven to the earth. While
descending, he prayed that he should fall in the midst of
good men.
<div n="NI"/>Just at this time, four kings named Pratardana, Vasu-
manas, Śibi and Aṣṭaka were performing a Yāga in
Naimiṣāraṇya. Yayāti happened to fall head down-
wards into their midst. But since they caught him in
[Page898-a+ 64]
his fall he did not crash to the ground. He explained
his story to them. They allowed him to accept the
fruit of their Yajña and to go to Heaven. But since he
was a Kṣatriya he told them he had no right to it. Just
then, his daughter Mādhavī arrived there. She allowed
him to take half of the divine grace which she had earned
and with the help of it Yayāti ascended to Heaven
again. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 120).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Yayāti witnessed the battle between Kauravas and
Pāṇḍavas which was fought as a result of the theft of
King Virāṭa's cows. (M.B. Virāṭa Parva, Chapter 56,
Verse 9).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) In Mahābhārata, Sabhā Parva, Chapter 8, Verse
8, it is stated that King Yayāti continues to be in
Yama's assembly.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Yayāti once gave 1,000 cows to a Brāhmaṇa as
“Gurudakṣiṇā”. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 195).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) He came riding in Indra's chariot and witnessed
the battle between Arjuna and Kṛpācārya, from the
sky. (M.B. Virāṭa Parva, Chapter 56, Verse 9).
<div n="NI"/>(v) Mahābhārata, Udyoga Parva, Chapter 115, men
tions that Yayāti had conducted 1,000 Yāgas and that
he was the leader of all Kings.
