JĀJALI¦. A hermit who reared birds on his head by
the power of penance.
<div n="NI"/>This hermit who had practised continence from his
childhood lived in a forest. Jājali never thought rain,
heat of the sun, snow and such other natural things
as unbearable. Once this hermit stood like a pillar in
the forest, immersed in meditation. Two birds built
their nests in his matted hair. Non-violence being his
policy, he did not move. The birds came to their nests
every evening and stayed for the night. After a few
days they laid eggs in the nests. Still the hermit did not
move. The eggs were hatched. The hermit understood
that also. Still, he did not move. The young ones got
wings. They grew up and began to go out with the
parent birds. They went out in the morning and
returned in the evening. The hermit stood like
a pillar. One morning they went out and
did not return in the evening. The hermit
stood there for six days waiting for the return
of the birds. On the sixth day evening they
returned. Next time the hermit waited for a month
for the return of the birds. They did not return. So he
started from there and went to the sea and dipped in
the water and said, “there is no man more virtuous
than I either in water or on land” with haughtiness. But
the water demons said in an ethereal voice that Tulā-
dhāra, the merchant of Kāśī was more virtuous than
he.
<div n="NI"/>Hearing this Jājali went to Kāśī and saw Tulādhāra.
Tulādhāra greeted him gladly and they talked for a
long time. Jājali understood that Tulādhāra was far
more virtuous than he. So he sought advice from
Tulādhāra and thus Jājali obtained heaven. (M.B.
Śānti Parva, 3 Chapters from 261).
