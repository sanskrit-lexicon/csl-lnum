ŚUKA II¦. A messenger of Rāvaṇa. This Śuka had a
friend named Sāraṇa. These two persons were expert
spies who used to gather secret and important pieces of
information from the strongholds of Rāvaṇa's friends
and enemies and passed them on to Rāvaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Soon after Śrī Rāma entered Laṅkā, Rāvaṇa sent Śuka
and Sāraṇa to Śrī Rāma's camp. After taking a distant
view of the surroundings, they entered the camp of
Śrī Rāma in the form of monkeys. Taking care not to
come within the observation of Vibhīṣaṇa, they went
about the military camps, gathering secret information.
Just then they were met by Jāmbavān and Hanūmān.
After closely observing them for a considerable time,
they understood that they were enemy spies. The
monkey-heroes promptly seized them and produced
them before Sugrīva. Confused and frightened under a
shower of questions they sought the protection of Śrī
Rāma. While Śrī Rāma was interrogating them,
Vibhīṣaṇa happened to come there. At his sight, Śuka
and Sāraṇa were alarmed. Grasping the whole situation
in an instant, Vibhīṣaṇa kicked both of them when
they assumed their former shapes as Rākṣasas. The
monkey-leaders sprang at them. The Rākṣasas begged
for pardon and prayed for Śrī Rāma's protection. Śrī
Rāma forgave them and set them free. (Vālmīki

Kāṇḍa).
