INDRA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Viṣṇu—Brahmā—Marīci—Kasyapa—
Indra.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Kaśyapa was born to Marīci, the eldest of
the spiritual sons of Brahmā. Indra was the son of
Kaśyapa and Aditi, the eldest daughter of Dakṣa. The
twelve sons who were born to Kaśyapa and Aditi are
called Ādityas. The twelve Ādityas are—Dhātā, Aryamā,
Mitra, Rudra, Varuṇa, Sūrya, Bhaga, Vivasvān, Pūṣā,
Savitā, Tvaṣṭā, and Viṣṇu. In addition to them, Aditi
had twentyone sons more. Indra is the eldest of the 33
sons. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 65, Verses 9-15).
<div n="NI"/>Indra became the ruler of the Devas. Airāvata is
Indra's elephant, Uccaiśśravas, his horse, and Vajra his
weapon. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 51, M.B. Ādi Parva,
Chapter 18).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Indra and Garuḍa.%} Kaśyapa had two sons, Garuḍa
and Aruṇa by Vinatā and a large number of Nāgas by
his other wife, Kadrū. Kadrū and her children kept
Vinatā and her son Garuḍa as their servants. Kadrū
agreed to set them free if they brought Amṛta from
Devaloka.
<div n="NI"/>Once Kadrū and her children asked Garuḍa to carry
them to the beautiful Nāgālaya in the middle of the
ocean. Garuḍa carried them on his shoulders and flew
very high near the sky. The excessive heat of the sun
made the Nāgas unconscious. Kadrū, in her distress,
prayed to Indra. Indra showered rain and cooled the
atmosphere. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 25, Verses 7-
17). They reached the lovely island in the middle of
the ocean.
<div n="NI"/>Garuḍa decided to earn his freedom by bringing Amṛta
from Devaloka. With determination, he flew up into
heaven and secured Amṛta. The enraged Indra attack-
ed him with his weapon, Vajra. But Garuḍa spread
his feathers in such a way that he was not wounded.
Indra was struck with wonder, and pleased with the
beautiful feathers (Parṇa) of Garuḍa, named him
‘Suparṇa’. At last Indra was pleased and allowed
Garuḍa to take Amṛta with him. (M.B. Ādi Parva,
Chapter 32, Verses 18-25).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%How Indra came to have 1000 eyes.%} (See Tilottamā, 2nd
Para).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Indra and Arjuna.%} (1) Kuntī, Pāṇḍu's wife had
received five mantras from Durvāsas for begetting sons.
One of those Mantras was chanted meditating on the
sun even before she was married and Karṇa was born.
After marriage she used three more of the Mantras and
three sons were born to her from Yama, Vāyu and
Indra respectively. The fifth Mantra was presented to
Mādrī the other wife of Pāṇḍu. Thus Arjuna was the
son of Kuntī by Indra. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter
123).
<div n="NI"/>(2) There is a story of a rivalry between Indra and
Arjuna in the Mahābhārata. (See under ‘Khāṇḍa-
vadāha’).
[Page319-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(3) During their life in the forest, once Arjuna
started to Kailāsa to worship Śiva. On the way Indra
appeared before him and showered his blessings on
him. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 41, Verses 15, 16).
<div n="NI"/>(4) During his life in the forest, Indra presented to
Arjuna who visited him in Indra's residence, a Gandh-
arva named Citrasena as his companion. Citrasena
taught him music, dance, etc. (M.B. Araṇya Parva,
Chapter 44, Verse 9).
<div n="NI"/>(5) At the palace of Indra, as secretly instructed by
Indra, Urvaśī approached Arjuna with advances of
love. Arjuna who refused to yield to her temptations
was turned into a eunuch by her curse. But Indra
lifted the curse by saying that this curse would be an
advantage to him during the incognito life of the
Pāṇḍavas. It was Citrasena who was used as a tool by
Indra to test Arjuna's self control. (M.B. Araṇya
Parva, Chapters 44, 45).
<div n="NI"/>(6) In order to ensure Arjuna's victory in battle,
Indra, disguised as a Brahmin, obtained by begging
Karṇa's ear-rings. (M.B. Araṇya Parva, Chapter 310).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Indra and Vṛtrāsura.%} A famous exploit of Indra was
the killing of Vṛtrāsura. Under the leadership of
Vṛtrāsura, the Kālakeyas and many other Rākṣasas
besieged the Devas. The battle raged furiously. Indra
fell down unconscious owing to the shower of arrows
from Vṛtra. At once Vasiṣṭha with his divine power
restored Indra to consciousness. Finding it impossible to
kill Vṛtra, the nonplussed Devas under the leadership of
Indra approached Mahāviṣṇu. Viṣṇu told them that
Vṛtra could be killed only with the bone of the sage
Dadhīca. So all of them approached Dadhīca. Realising
the situation, Dadhīca let Indra have his bone for the
purpose. Indra made his weapon Vajra with that bone
and receiving a fatal stroke from it, Vṛtra fell down
dead. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 101, Verses 14, 15;
Śānti Parva, Chapter 281, Verses 13-21).
<div n="NI"/>By killing Vṛtra Indra incurred the sin of Brahmahatyā.
To expiate for that sin the Devas and Ṛṣis took Indra
to Sarayū river and performed his holy bath there.
(Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa, 24th Sarga).
<div n="NI"/>(For further details about Vṛtrāsura see under Vṛtrā-
sura).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Indra and Cyavana.%} Indra did not allow the Aśvinī-
devas to drink soma juice. The sad Aśvinīdevas left
Indraloka and while passing through a forest, they met
Sukanyā, wife of the sage Cyavana. She was extremely
beautiful. The Aśvinīdevas advised her to become their
wife instead of being the wife of the blind Cyavana.
But Sukanyā rejected their advice. Pleased by her
conjugal fidelity, they restored Cyavana's eyesight and
made him a youth with beautiful eyes. In his gratitude,
Cyavana promised to get permission for them to drink
soma juice. He performed a yāga. Indra, Aśvinī devas
and other gods attended it. Indra insisted that the
Aśvinīs should not be allowed to drink Soma juice.
Cyavana disputed with him and in the dispute Indra
was defeated. From that time the Aśvinīs were allowed
Soma drinking. See also ‘Cyavana’. (M.B. Vana
Parva, Chapter 124, Verse 14; Anuśāsana Parva,
Chapter 156, Verses 16-31).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Indra and Triśiras.%} Indra's brother Tvaṣṭṛ did not
like some of Indra's activities. With the object of
rebuking Indra, Tvaṣṭṛ begot a son named Viśvarūpa,
Viśvarūpa had three faces and so he was also called
[Page319-b+ 65]
Triśiras. With one face he used to recite Vedas, with
the second he drank alcohol and he used the third face
for observing the world. He performed a rigorous
tapas. Indra, who was alarmed at it, sent goddesses to
allure him, but in vain. At last Indra himself went to
the forest riding on his elephant Airāvata and killed
Triśiras with his Vajrāyudha. In his violent fury he
had the three heads of Triśiras cut by a carpenter.
From that day, it was ordained that the head of the
cow sacrificed at yāgas should be given to a carpenter.
Tvaṣṭṛ who was enraged by Indra's killing of his son
Triśiras, begot another son Vṛtrāsura. (Devī Bhāgavata,
6th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Indra and Nahuṣa.%} See the word Agastya.
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Indra and Bali.%} When Indra defeated and drove
away the Asuras, Mahābali, the Asura emperor assu-
med the form of an ass and hid himself in an empty
house. Brahmā informed Indra of this. Indra found
him out there, but set him free without killing at the
behest of Brahmā. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 223).
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Indra and Yayāti.%} Yayāti was the son of Nahuṣa. In
his old age, he handed over the kingly duties to his
younger son Pūru and went to the forest for performing
penance. After performing penance, he reached
Indraloka in the end. Indra did not like Yayāti's boast
that there was none who had greater power of tapas
than himself. Indra pushed him down to the world.
(M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 88).
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Indra and Śaradvān.%} Śaradvān was born as the son of
Sage Gautama. Śaradvān started a penance for acquir-
ing divine arrows. Devendra who was alarmed, sent the
Apsarā woman Jānapatī to obstruct his tapas. Deeply
affected by her irresistible charm and fascinated by
her temptations, he had an involuntary emission of
semen, which fell on the Śarastamba and split itself into
two parts. Two children a boy and a girl, were born
from it. The King's servants brought them to
Hastināpura. The boy was named Kṛpa and the girl
was named Kṛpī. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 130).
<div n="NI"/>13) {%Indra and King Kuru.%} The King named Kuru was
once ploughing the field at the place known as Kuru-
kṣetra. (This was long before Kurukṣetra became
famous as the battlefield of Bhārata Yuddha). Indra
who happened to come that way at the time, seeing the
King tilling the land, asked him why he was doing so.
The King replied that he was performing a yāga to
enable the men who fell dead there, to attain Heaven.
Indra returned to Heaven, smiling. Other devas came
to know of this from Indra. They said that if all men
came to Devaloka, the share of yajña which was to be
received by the gods, would be diminished and so they
advised Indra to go and give some boon to King Kuru.
Indra returned to earth and gave his blessing to Kuru
as follows:
<div n="NI"/>The following classes of people will attain heaven if
they die there (at Kurukṣetra).
<div n="NI"/>(1) Those who die of starvation.
<div n="NI"/>(2) Those who die fighting heroically.
<div n="NI"/>(3) Those who were men in their previous life, but
who have been born as animals.
<div n="NI"/>From that time Kurukṣetra became an important
place. (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 53).
<div n="NI"/>14) {%Indra and Takṣaka.%} Indra's friend, a Nāga named
Takṣaka lived in Khāṇḍava forest. When Agni burned
Khāṇḍava forest, Indra caused the rain to fall in order
[Page320-a+ 65]
to save Takṣaka. See under ‘Khāṇḍavadāha’. (M.B.
Araṇya Parva, Chapter 235).
<div n="NI"/>For the story of how Indra saved Takṣaka from the
Sarpasatra see under ‘Āstika’.
<div n="NI"/>15) {%Indra and Khāṇḍavadāha.%} At the time of
Khāṇḍavadāha, Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna fought against
Devendra.
<div n="NI"/>16) {%Indra Sabhā.%} Maya undertook to build a sabhā
(assembly hall) for the Pāṇḍavas at Indraprastha.
When it was being discussed, the sage Nārada described
to them Indra's sabhā as given below:—
<div n="NI"/>Indra has a Sabhā which dazzles with divine effulgence.
It is 150 yojanas in length and 100 yojanas in breadth.
It has a height of five yojanas. Beautiful storeyed
buildings and divine trees add to the grandeur of the
sabhā. Indra is seated within the holy light in it.
Śacīdevī takes her seat near him. Indra is very hand-
some. He wears a crown, he is dressed in spotlessly
pure clothes, and wears a garland round his neck.
Maruts, Siddhas, Devas, Ṛṣis and a host of others
stand around attending on him. They are all bright with
the halo of fire. Parāśara, Parvata, Sāvarṇi, Gālava,
Śaṃkha, Likhita, Gauraśiras, Durvāsas, Akrodhana,
Śyena, Dīrghatamas, Pavitrapāṇi, Bhāluvi, Yājñavalkya,
Uddālaka, Śvetaketu, Pāṇḍya and other famous sages
are members of Indra's assembly. In this way, Indra's
Sabhā is the most magnificent. (M.B. Sabhā Parva,
Chapter 7).
<div n="NI"/>17) {%Indra and Kāmadhenu.%} Once Indra saw Surabhi, the
Kāmadhenu, crying in the Indraloka. He asked her
why she was crying. Surabhi answered: “My Lord, the
cattle, who are my children are groaning in the world
under the yoke of the farmer. I was overwhelmed with
grief at the sight of their sufferings” Indra's heart meltt-
ed due to Kāmadhenu's tears. He caused very heavy
showers in the world when ploughing the fields became
impossible. In this way as a result of Surabhi's tears
Indra caused heavy rainfall which gave rest to the cattle
in the world. (M.B. Araṇya Parva, Chapter 9).
<div n="NI"/>18) {%Indra and Nala.%} Nala proceeded to Vidarbha to
attend Damayantī's Svayaṃvara. On the way, the four
gods, Indra, Agni, Varuṇa and Yama met him. (For
further details see the word ‘Nala’). Nala married
Damayanti with the blessings of these gods. When the
devas returned, they met Kali and Dvāpara. to whom
they described Nala's marriage. Kali and Dvāpara who
wished to marry Damayantī, naturally felt disappointed
and angry. Kali was about to pronounce a curse on
Nala. But on the advice of Devendra he did not do so.
Still he decided to gain secret entrance into Nala's
body and to bring about the loss of his Kingdom.
(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 58).
<div n="NI"/>19) {%Indra and Māndhātā.%} A King named Yuvanāśva
was born in the Ikṣvāku dynasty. He earned great
reputation by performing many Aśvamedha yāgas. But
he was very much distressed because he had no child-
ren. So he entrusted his kingly duties to his ministers
and proceeded to the forest. One day during his wande-
ring he arrived at the āśrama of the sage Bhṛgu. He
was tired and thirsty. Bhṛgu had filled a pot with
water by reciting a mantra and placing it on a low
stool, he had gone to sleep. Not knowing that it was
a pot of water intended to cause pregnancy, and in his
intense thirst, Yuvanāśva drank water from it. He be-
came pregnant and in due course Yuvanāśva brought
[Page320-b+ 65]
forth a son. Indra, accompanied by other gods came
to see the child. When the Devas asked how the child
was going to drink milk, Indra put his index finger into
the child's mouth and the child began to suck it. Indra
said “The child will drink me”. The Sanskrit words
“Māṃ dhātā” mean “one who drinks me”. Thus the
child was named “Māndhātā” by Indra and the other
gods. (M.B. Araṇya Parva Chapter 126).
<div n="NI"/>20) {%Indra and Śibi.%} Once Indra and Agni tested the
strength of Emperor Śibi's ‘dharma’. Indra took the
form of an eagle and Agni that of a dove. The dove flew
down into the lap of Śibi. The eagle pursued it. The
dove entreated Śibi to save it from the eagle. Śibi pro-
mised to do so. The eagle argued that the dove was its
prey and should be returned to it. But Śibi offered to
give the eagle his own flesh, equal in weight to that of
the dove. Accordingly, the dove was placed in one pan,
but even when all the flesh from his body was cut and
placed in the other pan, it did not weigh equal to the
dove. At this stage, Indra and Agni appeared to Śibi
in their own forms and blessed him to be more happy
and prosperous than before. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chap-
ter 131).
<div n="NI"/>21) {%Indra and Yavakrīta.%} Long ago there was a sage
named Yavakrīta. He started a tapas with the ambition
of acquiring all knowledge by himself, without the help
of a Guru. Indra was alarmed at the sternness and
rigour of the tapas. He induced Yavakrīta to stop
tapas, but it was in vain. At last Indra disguised him-
self as an old Brahmin and went to the bank of the
Gaṅgā where Yavakrīta was performing tapas. He
began to build a dam across the river with sand. Seeing
this Yavakrīta ridiculed him. The old Brahmin retorted
that Yavakrīta's tapas was also equally ridiculous. But
Yavakrīta was not shaken even by his taunt. He resum-
ed his tapas with renewed strength. At last finding
no other alternative, Indra appeared to Yavakrīta and
granted his wish. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 135).
<div n="NI"/>22) {%Loss of Indra's umbrella.%} Once Narakāsura went
to heaven, fought with the gods and robbed Indra of his
umbrella and the earrings of Aditi, Indra's mother.
Grief-stricken Indra complained to Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Accom-
panied by Satyabhāmā and riding on the back of
Garuḍa, Śrī Kṛṣṇa went to the city of Prāgjyotiṣa, the
residence of Narakāsura and razed it to the ground. He
recovered the umbrella and ear-rings and returned to
heaven with Satyabhāmā. Indra and Aditi were over-
joyed on getting back the lost articles. On their return
journey, Śrī Kṛṣṇa at the request of Satyabhāmā cut
for her a twig of the Pārijāta tree. This made Indra
angry and he fought against Śrī Kṛṣṇa. After defeating
Indra and other gods, Śrī Kṛṣṇa accompanied by Sat-
yabhāmā returned to Dvārakā with the Pārijāta. (Bhā-
gavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>23) {%Indra and Narakāsura.%} The Asura called Naraka
once performed a very severe penance on the Gandha-
mādana mountain with the object of usurping Indra's
place. Indra was alarmed and rushed to Mahāviṣṇu
for help. Viṣṇu went to Gandhamādana mountain and
killed Narakāsura. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 142).
<div n="NI"/>24) {%Indra and the sage Baka.%} After the war between
Devas and Asuras, Indra, in a peaceful state of mind,
was going around the world, riding on his elephant,
Airāvata. When he reached an Āśrama on the eastern
coast of the sea, he met the great sage Baka. A conver-
[Page321-a+ 65]
sation about the happiness of longevity took place
between Indra and sage Baka who was hundred thousand
years old. After that Indra returned to Devaloka.
(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 193).
<div n="NI"/>25) {%Indra and Keśī.%} Long ago a terrible war took place
between Devas and Asuras. At that time an Asura
called Keśī attempted to abduct Devasenā, daughter of
a Prajāpati. Hearing her shrieks, Indra rushed to the
spot. In the clash between Keśī and Indra, Keśī's club
was broken into two with Indra's weapon Vajra.
Suddenly Keśī lifted a mountain and threw it at Indra.
<div n="NI"/>Indra broke that mountain also into two. One part of
it fell on Keśī himself, who fled frightened. After that,
Indra asked Devasenā how she happened to fall in
Keśī's hands. Devasenā answered thus:—“I am the
daughter of Prajāpati. My name is Devasenā. Keśī had
abducted my elder sister, Daityasenā. My sister and
I used to come to take our bath in this Mānasa lake.
Keśī had expressed his wish to abduct both of us. My
father has given me his blessing that a person who is
worshipped by gods and asuras will become my husband.
Having heard these facts, Indra held consultations with
Brahmā and arranged the marriage between Subrah-
maṇya and Devasenā. See also the word “Subrah-
maṇya”. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 223).
<div n="NI"/>26) {%Indra and Aṅgiras.%} After killing Vṛtrāsura, Indra
hid himself in a lotus flower in the Mānasa lake, to
expiate for the sin of Brahmahatyā (killing a Brahmin).
It was at that time that Nahuṣa became Indra. After
Nahuṣa had been forced to go back to the earth as a
serpent by the curse of Agastya, the Devas brought
back Indra. At that time, Aṅgiras praised Indra with
mantras from Atharvaveda. From that day Aṅgiras
got the name of ‘Atharvāṅgiras’. Indra was pleased
and blessed Aṅgiras that his name would become
famous throughout the world. (M.B. Udyoga Parva,
Chapter 18).
<div n="NI"/>27) {%Indra and the Bow called Vijaya.%} Karṇa had a
bow called Vijaya. It was made by Viśvakarmā accor-
ding to Indra's liking. (M.B. Karṇa Parva, Chapter 31.
Verse 42).
<div n="NI"/>28) {%Indra and the Tripuras.%} The Tripurāsuras perform-
ed penance and received boons from Brahmā. After
that they clashed with Indra. Indra was not able to
kill them. The vanquished Indra had the Tripuras
killed by Śiva. See the word “Tripura”. (M.B. Karṇa
Parva, Chapter 33).
<div n="NI"/>29) {%Indra and Sūrya (the sun-god).%} When Karṇa and
Arjuna came into conflict at the Bhārata battle, a con-
troversy raged in heaven between Indra and Sūrya.
Indra argued that Arjuna would win, while Sūrya as-
serted that Karṇa would gain victory. The Devas joined
the side of Arjuna and Asuras joined Karṇa's side. In
the end, Arjuna came out victorious and thus Sūrya
was defeated by Indra. (M.B. Karṇa Parva, Chapter
87).
<div n="NI"/>30) {%Indra and Namuci.%} The Rākṣasa Namuci once
evaded capture by Indra by remaining hidden in the
rays of the Sun. Indra went to him and pretending
friendship, promised not to kill him either with wet thing
or dry things or at night or in day time. Trusting his
words, Namuci came out. Then Indra cut off Namuci's
head with the froth scraped from the waves of the sea
at the time of dusk. The head pursued him shouting,
“You murderer of a friend, by breaking your promise!”
[Page321-b+ 65]
Indra sought refuge under Brahmā. Brahmā advised
him to bathe in Śoṇapuṇya tīrtha to expiate for the
sin. Accordingly Indra bathed in the river Sarasvatī
and washed off his sin.
<div n="NI"/>{%River Sarasvatī.%} There is a story about how Sarasvatī
river became Śoṇapuṇya tīrtha. There were frequent
quarrels between Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra. Once
Viśvāmitra got angry when he came to know that
Vasiṣṭha was performing a penance on the banks of the
river Sarasvatī. He summoned Sarasvatī and ordered
her to produce Vasiṣṭha before him immediately.
Sarasvatī was in a dilemma. If she brought Vasiṣṭha
to Viśvāmitra, Vasiṣṭha would curse her; if on the other
hand, she did not bring him Viśvāmitra would curse her.
At last she decided to produce Vasiṣṭha before Viśvāmi-
tra. By eroding the earth on her bank little by little near
the place where Vasiṣṭha was performing his penance,
Sarasvatī managed to bring him down into her own
current. Then she carried him floating down to the
place where Viśvāmitra was waiting. When Vasiṣṭha
reached his presence, Viśvāmitra was pleased. But
without allowing Viśvāmitra to capture Vasiṣṭha she
took him away in her current, eastwards. Enraged
at this, Viśvāmitra pronounced a curse that blood
should flow through the river Sarasvatī. Thus the
water in the river became blood-red. The great sages
who came there afterwards sympathised with Sarasvatī
in her ill-luck and as a result of their prayers Śiva
made her Śoṇapuṇyatīrtha.
<div n="NI"/>It was in this river that Indra took his bath and
washed off his sin. (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 43).
<div n="NI"/>31) {%Indra and Śrutāvatī.%} Bharadvāja's daughter
Śrutāvatī (Śruvāvatī) performed a very severe penance
to get Indra as her husband. To test her character,
Indra assumed the shape of Vasiṣṭha and went to
Śrutāvatī. She received the guest with due reverence.
Pleased with her treatment, the guest handed her five
raw fruits and asked her to cook them for him.
Śrutāvatī gladly undertook that service. She proceeded
to cook the fruits but even after burning all the fuel
she had, the fruits were not properly cooked. So she
began to use her limbs one by one as fuel and burned
them up. Indra was deeply impressed by her self-
sacrifice and appearing to her in his own form married
Śrutāvatī, (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 48).
<div n="NI"/>32) {%Indra became Śatakratu.%} Indra performed one
hundred sacrifices at the place called Indratīrtha. Thus
he became Śatakratu. It was there that he gave much
wealth to Bṛhaspati. (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 49,
Verse 2).
<div n="NI"/>33) {%Indra became a bird.%} Once Indra took the form of
a bird and went to the forest and preached moral and
spiritual duties to the sages who had gathered there.
(M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 11).
<div n="NI"/>34) {%Indra and Dantideva.%} Once Dantideva received a
boon from Indra that he should have plenty of food
and enough travellers to eat it. (M.B. Śānti Parva,
Chapter 29, Verses 120, 121).
<div n="NI"/>35) {%Indra and Bṛhaspati.%} Once Bṛhaspati told Indra
that everything in the world could be achieved with
soothing speech. (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 84, Verse
2).
<div n="NI"/>Bṛhaspati's wife Tārā once fell in love with Candra
(the Moon god). She deserted Bṛhaspati and went to
live in Candra's residence. Bṛhaspati complained
[Page322-a+ 65]
about it to Indra. Indra promised to bring her back
and to restore her to Bṛhaspati by whatever means
possible. Accordingly he sent a messenger to Candra.
Compromise talks with Candra ended in failure. So
preparations were started for a dreadful war between
Indra and Candra. Śukra, the preceptor of Asuras
also joined the side of Indra. Brahmā who came to
know of all this, came riding on his swan and recon-
ciled Indra and Candra. As directed by Brahmā,
Candra agreed to restore Tārā to her lawful husband,
Bṛhaspati, (Devī Bhāgavata, First Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>36) {%Indra and Prahlāda.%} The great King Prahlāda once
conquered Heaven. Indra, who lost his kingdom and
glory, accepted Bṛhaspati's advice and went to meet
Śukrācārya. Śukra told Indra that Prahlāda was the
noblest person and that he had earned that nobility by
his good qualities. Indra decided to acquire those good
qualities from Prahlāda.
<div n="NI"/>Indra disguised himself as a Brahmin boy and approa-
ched Prahlāda with a request for moral and spiritual
advice. Prahlāda accepted him as his pupil and gave
him moral and spiritual advice. Pleased with the
pupil's devotion, Prahlāda agreed to give him whatever
boon he wanted. The pupil said that he wanted only
the good qualities of the Guru. Prahlāda agreed to it.
Then a shadow-like figure appeared to emerge from
Prahlāda's body. Prahlāda who was puzzled asked the
figure:—“Who are you” “The figure answered:—“I
am your virtuous character. Now I am leaving you
and entering this boy's body.” Saying thus it left
Prahlāda's body and entered Indra's body.
Following it, all the good qualities of Prahlāda, like
charity, truth, glory etc. entered Indra's body one
after another. It was only in the end that Prahlāda
came to know that the cunning pupil was Indra. Thus
from that day, Prahlāda began to decline in his good
qualities and Indra began to prosper. (M.B. Śānti
Parva, Chapter 124).
<div n="NI"/>37) {%Indra and Gautama.%} There is a story in the Mahā-
bhārata, of how Indra restored life to a dead Brahmin.
Gautama was a Brahmin who had left his own home
and settled down to live in the village of Dasyus (an
aboriginal tribe). He married from a low caste and
followed the customs of Dasyus. At that time another
Brahmin happened to come there. He ridiculed
Gautama who had lost his caste. Next morning
Gautama left his residence and went to another place.
Tired after his long journey, he fell asleep under a
banyan tree. A King of birds named Nāḍījaṃgha
lived on that tree. Nāḍījaṃgha who was the son of
Kaśyapa, became very friendly with Gautama. He
brought fish from the river Gaṅgā to feed Gautama
and fanned him with his wings. Gautama told the
bird that he was a poor Brahmin and that he was
anxious to get some wealth. There was a wealthy
Rākṣasa King named Virūpākṣa in that country, who
was a close friend of Nāḍījaṃgha. Nāḍījaṃgha sent
Gautama to Virūpākṣa with a request to give Gautama
some wealth. Virūpākṣa gave plenty of gold to
Gautama. He returned to the foot of the banyan tree
carrying the gold on his head. Gautama who was
quite tired after his long walk, was hospitably received
by Nāḍījaṃgha. That kingly bird lay asleep close by
Gautama. An evil desire to eat the flesh of Nāḍī-
jaṃgha dawned upon the mind of Gautama. He killed
[Page322-b+ 66]
that King of birds in his sleep. Virūpākṣa who came to
know of this, killed Gautama and gave his flesh as food
for Dasyus. Virūpākṣa, with tears in his eyes, made a
funeral pyre and cremated Nādījaṃgha's body. At that
time, as directed by Brahmā, Surabhi caused milk to
flow from heaven and revived Nāḍījaṃgha. Virūpākṣa
told the whole story to Indra who came there at that
time. Indra said that Nāḍījaṃgha died as the result of
Brahmā's curse. He had offended Brahmā on a former
occasion by refusing to attend Brahmā's assembly,
although he was invited. Nāḍījaṃgha who was restored
to life, was noble enough to request Indra to bring
back Gautama also to life. Accordingly Indra revived
Gautama. Nāḍījaṃgha returned the gold to Gautama
and sent him away with his good wishes. Indra returned
to heaven. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 173).
<div n="NI"/>38) {%Indra and Ahalyā.%} Indra, once fell in love with
Ahalyā, the wife of Gautama. Sage Gautama who
came to know of it, cursed Indra. For further details,
see under Ahalyā.
<div n="NI"/>39) {%Indra turned into a Fox.%} Once a haughty Vaiśya
knocked down a young sage named Kaśyapa, with his
chariot. The disgraced sage decided to commit suicide.
Knowing this Indra went to the sage in the form of a
fox and spoke to him, dwelling upon the evil aspects
of suicide. At last the young sage gave up the idea of
committing suicide and returned to his hermitage.
(M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 130).
<div n="NI"/>40) {%Indra and Subrahmaṇya.%} Long ago the Asuras led
by Tārakāsura, persecuted the gods in many ways.
Tārakāsura had received a boon from Brahmā that
only the son born to Śiva could slay him. So, to dis-
tract Parameśvara from his penance, in order to make
it possible for him to beget a son, Indra sent Kāmadeva
(god of love) to him. But Kāmadeva was burnt up in
the fire from the third eye of Śiva. After that Pārvatī
won Śiva as her husband as a result of her austere
penance. She prayed to Śiva that Kāmadeva should be
brought back to life and that a son should be born to
her. Śiva replied to her:—
<div n="NI"/>“Kāma was born from Brahmā's mind. As soon as he
was born, he asked Brahmā “Kaṃ Darpam?” which
means—whom shall I tempt and conquer?” So Brahmā
called him “Kandarpa”. Brahmā had advised him
even at that time that he should never tempt me.
Disregarding that advice he came to attack me and I
burned him up. Now it is not possible for him to be
born in a physical form I shall beget of you a son
with my spiritual power. I do not need the urge of
Kāmadeva for this, as in the case of ordinary
mortals”.
<div n="NI"/>As they were discussing this problem, Indra and Brahmā
arrived there. At their request Śiva agreed to beget a
son by Pārvatī. Since it is not desirable that all
living beings should perish, Śiva allowed Kāmadeva
to be born in the minds of all creatures. Brahmā and
Indra returned quite happy. One day, Śiva and
Pārvatī began their amorous dalliance. They did not
stop it even after a hundred years. The whole world
began to shake to its very foundations. Fearing that
the world might perish, the devas, as ordered by
Brahmā prayed to Agni, to interrupt the amorous play
of Śiva and Pārvatī. Agni, who understood that it was
not possible to achieve their object, fled and concealed
himself under water. The Devas went out in search
of Agni. By that time, the creatures in the water who
[Page323-a+ 65]
could not bear the heat of Agni, told them the secret.
Then Agni deprived them of the power of speech by a
curse. After that he went and hid himself on the
Mandara mountain. Elephants and parrots disclosed
the secrets of Agni, who was hiding within the hollow
of the trunk of a tree. Agni deprived them of their
tongues by a curse. At last the gods discovered Agni.
They sent him at once to Śiva to stop him in his
amorous dalliance. Agni succeeded in his mission by
his intense heat. Śiva transferred his semen to Agni who
became pregnant. Being unable to bear its weight Agni
deposited it in the river Gaṅgā, who at the behest of
Śiva himself, left it in the woods on the Mahāmeru
mountain. Śiva's attendant bhūtas (spirits) offered
Pūjā to it there. After a thousand years a boy with six
faces (Subrahmaṇya) was born out of it. He was suck-
led by the Kṛttikās employed for that purpose by
Pārvatī and the boy grew up with astonishing rapidity
within a few days. Having been suckled by the
Kṛttikās, the boy got the name “Kārttikeya”.
<div n="NI"/>In those days, Devendra who was defeated by Tārakā-
sura, decided to give up war and was living in Mahā-
meru. The Devas and the sages used to go to Subrah-
maṇya for protection. When Devendra knew it, he
became angry and went to war with Subrahmaṇya.
Subrahmaṇya was wounded on the face with Indra's
weapon. From the wound two sons named Śākha and
Viśākha were born to Subrahmaṇya. With their help
Subrahmaṇya encountered Indra again. At this stage
Śiva appeared there and informed Indra that Subrah-
maṇya had been born with a mission to kill Tārakāsura
and to restore Indra's kingdom to him. It was then
that Indra recognized Subrahmaṇya. He begged pardon
of Subrahmaṇya and expressed his desire to instal him
as his military commander. When he tried to perform
the ceremony of installation by sprinkling the holy
water on Subrahmaṇya's head, the water refused to
come out of the pot. Śiva told Indra that it was
because he had tried to perform the installation before
propitiating Gaṇapati. Indra then offered worship to
Vighneśvara (Gaṇapati) and the ceremony went off
without any hitch. Subrahmaṇya who thus became
Indra's commander, killed Tārakāsura shortly after-
wards. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Lāvāṇakalaṃbaka, 6th
Taraṅga).
<div n="NI"/>41) {%Indra and Mahābali.%} The vanquished Mahābali
who had left his home and country was in gloom
and despair when once Indra paid him a visit.
At that time Mahālakṣmī emerged from Mahābali's
body and entered Indra's body. (M.B. Śānti Parva,
Chapter 224).
<div n="NI"/>42) {%Indra and Godāna (gift of cow).%} Once Indra asked
Brahmā about the efficacy of godāna or giving a cow
as gift. Brahmā told him that there is a world free from
the infirmities of old age and diseases and it is called
“Goloka”. He added that those who perform Godāna
would get a place in Goloka.
<div n="NI"/>43) {%Indra and a bird.%} A hunter in Kāśī once went to
shoot birds with poisoned arrows. One of his arrows
hit a big tree accidentally and the powerful poison dried
up the whole tree. In the hollow of the trunk of that
tree there lived a bird with mystic powers. It did not
like to leave that tree which had been its refuge
ever since its birth. One day Devendra, in the guise of
a Brahmin came to the bird, who recognized him by
[Page323-b+ 65]
its mystic power. In the conversation between them
Devendra advised the bird to leave the tree and find
some other suitable place for its residence. The bird
did not accept his advice. Indra was pleased at the
bird's loyalty and gratitude towards that tree which
had been its shelter all along. So he took the bird
along with him to Devaloka. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva,
Chapter 5).
<div n="NI"/>44) {%How Indra turned Bhaṃgāśva into a woman.%} There
was a King named Bhaṃgāśva. Once he performed a
sacrifice called “Indradviṣṭa” which was believed to
have the power of blessing him with children. Indra
being not invited was displeased with him and was wait-
ing for an opportunity to wreak vengeance on him.
<div n="NI"/>One hundred sons were born to Bhaṃgāśva. Once he
went to the forest after entrusting the affairs of the
kingdom to his sons. Indra cunningly misguided him
and made him lose his way in the forest. Wandering
alone with his horse in the forest, he reached the bank
of a river. Weary and thirsty, he stepped down into the
river. To his amazement, he was instantly transformed
into a woman! The bewildered “woman” somehow
reached Bhaṃgāśva's palace. All the members of his
family were deeply grieved over his change of sex. To
avoid embarrassment to himself and others, Bhaṃgāśva
returned as a woman to the forest and there lived as
the wife of a sage and became the mother of a hundred
sons. After some years “she” went back to the palace
with the sons and leaving them there returned again
to the forest.
<div n="NI"/>Indra went to the palace at this time and made the
two sets of hundred sons quarrel with one another
until all of them perished in fighting. Hearing about
this the mother who was in the forest, wept bitterly.
Indra visited her (Bhaṃgāśva) there and she told him
the whole story of her misfortunes and begged his
pardon for performing Indradviṣṭa sacrifice without
inviting Indra. Pleased with her repentance Indra
promised to resuscitate one set of her hundred sons.
She wanted all the hundred sons who were born when
she was a woman, to be restored to life. Indra was
ready to restore her manhood too, but she preferred
to continue as a woman. Indra restored to life all the
200 sons of Bhaṃgāśva and leaving Bhaṃgāśva as a
woman, returned to Devaloka. (M.B. Anuśāsana
Parva, Chapter 12).
<div n="NI"/>45) {%Indra and Mataṃga.%} A story is found in the Mahā-
Bhārata under the title of “Indra-Mataṃga-Saṃvāda”
which illustrates that a Kṣatriya, Vaiśya or Śūdra can
never become a Brāhmaṇa by any means. It was told
by Bhīṣma to Arjuna as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>“Long ago a Brāhmaṇa's wife gave birth to a boy. The
boy was given the name Mataṃga. His father sent him
in a chariot drawn by a donkey, in connection with a
yāga which he wanted to perform. Mataṃga whipped
the donkey mercilessly. Seeing this, the donkey's mother
said to Mataṃga—“You are not a Brāhmaṇa.
Brāhmaṇas cannot be so cruel. You are a Caṇḍāla (a
man of the lowest caste) born to your mother by a
barber.”
<div n="NI"/>Mataṃga sadly returned to his father and after telling
him what he had heard from the mother-donkey set out
to perform an austere penance with the object of
becoming a Brāhmaṇa. Devendra appeared to him
and asked him what he wanted. Mataṃga asked for a
[Page324-a+ 65]
boon whereby he could become a Brāhmaṇa; Indra
vanished after saying that it was impossible. After that
Mataṃga performed penance for hundred years,
standing on one foot. Indra appeared again and
repeated that it was impossible for Mataṃga to be-
come a Brāhmaṇa. Then Mataṃga continued his
penance for a thousand years, standing on his toe.
Indra appeared again and transformed Mataṃga into
a Deva named “Chandodeva”. Indra told him that
though he could become a Deva, he could never
achieve Brahminhood. In his extreme grief Mataṃga
renounced his life and entered Heaven. (M.B. Anuśā-
sana Parva, Chapters 27, 28 and 29).
<div n="NI"/>46) {%Indra and Śaṃbara.%} There is a story in the Mahā
Bhārata in which an Asura named Śaṃbara explained
the greatness of Brahminhood to Indra. Once Indra
approached the Asura, Śaṃbara and asked him what
was the source of his glory and prosperity. Śaṃbara
replied that it was all due to his whole-hearted worship
of Brāhmaṇas. From that time Indra began to offer
worship to Brāhmaṇas and thus he won the place of
Indra. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 36).
<div n="NI"/>47) {%Indra loved Ruci.%} There is a story in the Mahā-
bhārata of how a sage named Vipula who was born in
the family of Bhṛgu once saved Ruci, his Guru's wife
from Indra. Long ago, a great sage named Devaśarmā
lived in a forest. His wife Ruci being enchantingly
beautiful, many suitors were attracted to her. Chief
among them was Indra. Devaśarmā was aware of this.
Once he had to leave his āśrama in connection with a
yāga. So he ordered his disciple Vipula to guard his
wife Ruci during his absence. He had given a hint to
Vipula that Indra who was an expert in disguises,
might appear in the āśrama in any form. Vipula, by
means of his mystic power entered into his guru's wife
and guarded her.
<div n="NI"/>After some time, Indra reached the Āśrama in the guise
of a handsome youth. He disclosed his real identity to
Ruci and told her that he had come there to spend a
night with her. Ruci fell in love with him. But since
she was under the mystic control of Vipula, Indra was
unable to fulfil his desire. At last Vipula sent him away
in disgrace. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 4, 44).
<div n="NI"/>48) {%Indra's theft of Lotus.%} Indra once stole Agastya's
lotuses. (See under Agastya).
<div n="NI"/>49) {%Indra's theft of an Elephant.%} Indra once stole an
elephant belonging to the great sage Gautama. The
sage complained to Dhṛtarāṣṭra, who advised him to
offer prayers to Indra. Accordingly Gautama pleased
Indra by his prayers. Indra appeared and after return-
ing the elephant took both the elephant and Gautama
along with him to Devaloka. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva,
Chapter 102).
<div n="NI"/>50) {%Indra and Marutta.%} Long ago there was a famous
king named Marutta. Indra was closely associated with
him in many of his activities. (For more details see
Marutta).
<div n="NI"/>51) {%Indra and Dharmaputra.%} Another anecdote about
Indra which deals with the last part of Dharmaputra's
life is given in the Mahābhārata.
<div n="NI"/>The Pāṇḍavas, towards the end of their lives entered
the forest and were travelling to the north. Dharma-
putra who was walking in front, was followed by a dog.
On the way the four brothers and Pāñcālī fell down
dead. Dharmaputra continued his journey accompanied
[Page324-b+ 65]
by the dog without turning back or looking behind. At
the end of the journey, Indra was waiting for him with
his chariot. He told Dharmaputra that his brothers and
wife had already taken their places in Heaven and that
he should leave behind the dog and get into the chariot
to go to Devaloka. Dharmaputra pleaded that it was
not right for him to enter Devaloka after deserting the
dog which had followed him so far. Even though Indra
pressed him very much to enter the chariot without the
dog, Dharmaputra did not yield. At last the dog assum-
ed the form of Yama who appeared and explained to
them that he had taken the form of a dog and followed
his son Dharmaputra to test his noble nature. They
were all happy and all the three of them proceeded in
the chariot to Devaloka. (M.B. Mahāprasthānika
Parva, Chapter 3).
<div n="NI"/>52) {%Indra and Bāli.%} In Uttara Rāmāyaṇa there is a
story as given below, about the birth of Bāli, a son of
Indra:—
<div n="NI"/>Aruṇa, the charioteer of Sūrya (the sun-god) went one
night to Indraloka to see the goddesses dancing. Men
were not allowed to enter the dancing hall. So, Aruṇa
managed to enter the hall by disguising himself as a
beautiful lady. The moment Indra saw her he fell in
love with her. The name she assumed at that time was
Aruṇī. Indra secretly took her outside and they had a
sexual union. Bāli was the son born from their union.
<div n="NI"/>53) {%Indra's theft of a Horse.%} A King named Sagara once
performed a sacrifice. Devendra stole the sacrificial
horse. Sagara sent all his 60,000 sons in search of the
horse. They dug up the earth and went to the Nether
worlds where they saw the horse tied in front of the
sage Kapila. The enraged sons of Sagara tried to
capture and bind the sage. But Kapila reduced all
the 60,000 princes to ashes by his curse. (Vālmīki
Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, Chapter 39).
<div n="NI"/>54) {%Indra cut an embryo to pieces.%} Diti and Aditi were
the daughters of Dakṣa. Kaśyapa married them. Indra
was born as the son of Aditi. At this birth of a son to
Aditi, Diti became jealous of her sister. One day she
told her husband Kaśyapa that she too wanted to have
a virtuous, heroic and brave son who would be equal
to Indra in every respect. Kaśyapa promised to grant
her wish.
<div n="NI"/>In due course, Diti became pregnant. Now it was
Aditi's turn to become jealous of Diti. She could not
bear the thought of Diti having a son equal to her own
son Indra, in glory and splendour. So she called Indra
and secretly instructed him to destroy Diti's child in the
womb, by whatever means.
<div n="NI"/>In obedience to his mother, Indra approached Diti
pretending friendship and spent a lot of time in her
company. He soon won her confidence and love by his
affectionate attentions. On one occasion, when she was
in sound sleep, Indra, by his mystic power, entered into
Diti's womb with his weapon Vajra and cut the child
in the womb into seven pieces. The child began to cry
loudly, but Indra said “Mā ruda” which means “do
not cry” and cut each of the pieces again into seven
parts. Thus the embryo (child) was finally cut into
fortynine pieces, which later became the fortynine
“Mārutas” or “Maruts”. When she woke up, Diti
realized Indra's treachery and in her fury she cursed
Indra and Aditi. She cursed that Indra would lose his
kingdom of Devaloka and that Aditi would be im-
[Page325-a+ 65]
prisoned and her sons would be killed. As a result of
this curse Devendra lost his kingdom on one occasion.
Aditi, in her next birth, was born as Devakī, wife of
Vasudeva and was imprisoned by Kaṃsa who killed
her children. (Devī Bhāgavata, Fourth Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>55) {%Indra and Aṃbarīṣa.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) King Aṃbarīṣa had a minister named Sudeva.
Sudeva fell fighting in the battle-field. After some years,
Aṃbarīṣa also died. When Aṃbarīṣa arrived in Heaven,
he was surprised to find that Sudeva had already secured
a place there long ago. Ambarīṣa had performed many
more acts of holiness than Sudeva. Yet Sudeva attained
Heaven earlier than Aṃbarīṣa. Aṃbarīṣa asked Indra
why it was so. Indra answered that just as Aṃbarīṣa had
performed many sacrifices, Sudeva had performed many
war-sacrifices. He added that war-sacrifices were as
efficacious for attaining Heaven as other kinds of sacrifices
(M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 98).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Aṃbarīṣa, King of Ayodhyā was performing a
sacrifice. At that time, Indra had stolen the sacrificial
animal. To continue the sacrifice without interruption,
the King decided to substitute Śunaśśepha, the son of
Ṛcīka, for the cow. But Śunaśśepha prayed to Indra
who came and rescued him from the jaws of death.
(This story is given in other Purāṇas with slight varia-
tions. Vālṃīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa, 61st Sarga).
<div n="NI"/>56) {%Indra and Triśaṅku.%} There is a story that Indra
once pushed down from Heaven, Triśaṅku a King of the
Sūrya vaṃśa (Solar dynasty). See under TRIŚAṄKU.
<div n="NI"/>57) {%Indra and Viśvāmitra.%} Once Viśvāmitra observed a
vow of silence for a period of one thousand years. At the
end of that period, when he was about to take his food,
Indra appeared in the form of a Brahmin and asked for
that food. Viśvāmitra gave that food to the Brahmin
and resumed his austere penance. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
Bāla Kāṇḍa, 65th Sarga).
<div n="NI"/>58) {%Indra, Śrī Rāma and Śarabhaṅga.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1). At the time when Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were
leading their life in the forest, one day Indra paid a visit
to the Āśrama of the sage Śarabhaṅga. Devendra wished
to take the sage with him to Devaloka. As they were
talking, they saw Śrī Rāma coming to the Āśrama. Indra
advised Śarabhaṅga to speak to Śrī Rāma and left the
place. As suggested by Indra, the sage had a conversa-
tion with Śrī Rāma. After it Śarabhaṅga offered his
body to the fire and went to Devaloka. (Vālmīki
Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇya Kāṇḍa, 5th Sarga).
<div n="NI"/>(2) When the battle between Śrī Rāma and Rāvaṇa
was in progress, Indra presented to Śrī Rāma, an
excellent chariot along with the horses. The chariot and
horses were handed over to Śrī Rāma on the battlefield
by Mātali; Indra's charioteer. Śrī Rāma fought against
Rāvaṇa from that chariot and slew him. (Vālmīki
Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa, Sarga 103).
<div n="NI"/>(3) After the war with Rāvaṇa, Indra appeared before
Śrī Rāma and asked him what boon he wanted. Śrī
Rāma replied that all those monkeys who died in the
war should come back to life and the forests in which
they lived should abound in fruits and flowers in all the
seasons of the year. Indra restored all those monkeys to
life and made all the forests in which they lived, green
and rich with luxuriant vegetation. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
Yuddha Kāṇḍa, Sarga 129).
<div n="NI"/>59) {%Indra gives his sword for safe-custody.%} During their life
in the forest Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, accompanied by
[Page325-b+ 65]
Sītā entered Daṇḍakāraṇya. Śrī Rāma's chief object in
going there was to give protection to the sages and their
hermitages in the forest. But seeing that he had made the
killing of Rākṣasas his main purpose, Sītā told him that
this change in the objective would spoil other important
matters. To illustrate this she told him the following
story:—
<div n="NI"/>‘Once upon a time, a great sage was observing holy
rites with great austerity. Indra was alarmed at it. He
went to the sage's hermitage in the form of a warrior
armed with a sword. Indra handed over his sword to
the sage for safe custody. The sage accepted it and
from that time all his attention was concentrated on
the sword. All his time was spent in guarding the
sword and he began to neglect his devotional duties
as a sage. As a result of it his mystic power declined
and ultimately he fell into Hell. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
Araṇya Kāṇḍa, 9th Sarga).
<div n="NI"/>60) {%Indra and Kabandha.%} See under Kabandha.
<div n="NI"/>61) {%The Post or Office of Indra.%} Indra was anointed as
King of Devas on Meghavān mountain. In the 42nd
Sarga of Kiṣkindhā kāṇḍa of Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa we
find that Sugrīva had ordered the monkeys to search
for Sītā on that mountain also.
<div n="NI"/>62) {%Indra and Maya.%} Maya, the carpenter of the
Asuras, performed penance to Brahmā and acquired
complete mastery in the science of carpentry and
architecture. After that he constructed a forest mansion
of golden colour and took up his residence in it. Once
Maya set his eyes on a goddess named Hemā. When
Indra knew this he became angry and killed Maya
with his weapon—Vajra. From that time Hemā got
Maya's golden mansion. This was told by Hemā's
maid, Svayaṃprabhā to Hanūmān. (Vālmīki Rāmā-
yaṇa, Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, 51st Sarga).
<div n="NI"/>63). {%Indra cut off the wings of Mountains.%} In Kṛtayuga
all the Mountains in the world had wings. They used
to fly about here and there like Garuḍa with the
speed of wind. The sages and the Devas feared that
they might fall on their heads. The Devas held a con-
ference and elected Indra to find a remedy for this.
Indra cut off the wings of the mountains with his Vajra.
The Maināka mountain was a friend of wind. When
Indra was about to cut off the wings of that mountain,
Wind suddenly removed it and deposited it in the
ocean. It is out of his gratitude for this that the
Maināka mountain rose up from the ocean and pro-
vided a resting place for Hanūmān, the son of Wind
god, when he jumped to Laṅkā. This story was told
by Maināka mountain to Hanūmān. (Vālmīki Rāmā-
yaṇa, Sundara Kāṇḍa, 1st Sarga).
<div n="NI"/>64) {%Indra cut off his preceptor's head%} Once Devendra
accepted a sage named Viśvarūpa as his preceptor for
a sacrifice. Viśvarūpa's mother was a Dānava partisan.
So this priest, as directed by his mother, performed
the sacrifice with the prayer—“May the gods and the
Asuras prosper.” As a result of the prayer, both the
gods who performed the sacrifice and the Asuras
who did not perform it, prospered. At this Devendra
became furious and he cut off the head of the Guru.
(Devī Bhāgavata, 3rd Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>65) {%Indra and Mahiṣāsura.%} See under Mahiṣāsura.
<div n="NI"/>66) {%Indra became a bull.%} Long ago there was a King
called Kakutstha in the Ikṣvāku dynasty. When he was
ruling over the kingdom of Ayodhyā, a war broke
[Page326-a+ 64]
out between Devas and Asuras. In that war, the Devas
were not able to defeat the Asuras. Indra in distress
approached Viṣṇu for refuge. Viṣṇu advised him to
seek the help of Kakutstha, King of Ayodhyā. So Indra
with the other gods went to Ayodhyā. When Kakutstha
heard about their appeal for help, he gladly offered
his help but only on condition that Indra became his
vehicle. Seeing no other way, Indra assumed the
form of a bull and Kakutstha, riding on the back of
the bull fought against the Asuras and defeated them.
It is from that day that the King came to be called
“Kakutstha”, “Indra-vāhana” and “Purañjaya”. (His
original name is unknown). “Kakut” means the “hamp
of a bull”. Because he was seated on the “Kakut” he
got the name “Kakutstha”. Because he made Indra
“vāhana” (vehicle) he got the name of “Indravāhana”.
As he defeated the Asuras and conquered their city
(pura) he was called “Purañjaya”. Kakutstha was the
son of Śaśāda and the father of Pṛthu. Śrī Rāma is
called “Kākutstha” because he was born in the
family of Kakutstha. (Devī Bhāgavata, 7th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>67) {%Indra's Task.%} Devī Bhāgavata, 8th Skandha says
that Indra is one of the “Aṣṭadikpālakas (the eight
protectors of the quarters) and the name of his city
is “Amarāvatī”.
<div n="NI"/>68). {%Indra's term of Life.%} The Devī Bhāgavata 5th
Skandha says that two life-spans of Brahmā make
Viṣṇu's life-span. Śiva has double the life-span of
Viṣṇu, that during the life of Brahmā, fourteen
Indras will drop down from Heaven and perish, and
one day of Brahmā is made up of one thousand
“Caturyugas.”
<div n="NI"/>There are fourteen Manvantaras during the life of the
present Brahmā (See under Manvantara). This means
that fourteen Manus will be born and will die one
after another during this period. Each Manvantara will
have its own Indra and the Devas. The first Manu was
Svāyambhuva. After him five more Manus, Svārociṣa,
Uttama, Tāmasa, Raivata and Cākṣuṣa, have passed
away. The present Manu is Vaivasvata the son of
Sūrya. The current Vaivasvata Manvantara is the
seventh. At the end of seven more Manvantaras, the
present Brahmā will perish and a new Brahmā will
be born. For the names of the Indras of different
Manvantaras, see under Manvantara. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa,
Part 2, Chapter 1).
<div n="NI"/>69) {%Indra became a Calf.%} (See under Pṛthu).
<div n="NI"/>70) {%The name Purandara.%} Sardar K.M. Panikkar
in his preface to Ṛgveda Saṃhitā says that Indra
got the name Purandara because he destroyed the
cities (Puras) of the Dasyus. But in Chapter 71, of
Vāmana Purāṇa, we are told that he got this name
because he killed “Pura”, the son of Mahābali.
<div n="NI"/>71) {%Indra in the land of Koṅkaṇa.%} Once an Asura named
Śūrapadma obtained from Brahmā, a boon to enable
him to conquer the whole world. He persecuted the
inhabitants of all the three worlds. He sent his followers
to bring Indrāṇī (Indra's wife) to him as a captive.
Indra, who came to know of this, secretly went away
with Indrāṇī to the Koṅkaṇa land and lived in a
temple there. After some days, entrusting Indrāṇī to
the protection of Śāstā, he went to Kailāsa. Just at this
time, Śūrapadma's sister Ajāmukhī came there and
tempted Indrāṇī. Śāstā cut off the hands of Ajāmukhī
[Page326-b+ 65]
and took Indrāṇī to Kailāsa. (Skanda Purāṇa, Asura
Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>72) {%Indra and Mucukunda.%} Mucukunda, a King of the
Ikṣvāku dynasty, once went to Devaloka at the invita-
tion of Indra. In the war between the Devas and
Asuras, Mucukunda helped Indra and the Asuras were
defeated. Indra was pleased and asked Mucukunda
what boon he wanted. Mucukunda asked for a boon
which would give him long and sound sleep. Indra
granted it and in addition declared that anyone who
disturbed Mucukunda's sleep would be reduced to
ashes. After that Mucukunda went to sleep in a cave
in the middle of a dense forest.
<div n="NI"/>A King of the tribe Yavana performed penance to
Brahmā and obtained his boon which would enable
him to defeat the Yādavas (Śrī Kṛṣṇa's clan) and
he began to fight with Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Because of
Brahmā's boon, Śrī Kṛṣṇa was not able to kill him.
He drove Yavana into the cave in which Mucukunda
was sleeping. Mucukunda suddenly woke up from his
sleep and looked at him with great anger. Yavana
was at once reduced to ashes. (Bhāgavata, 10th
Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>73) {%Indra's favourite Drink.%} The juice of the Soma
Plant is the favourite drink of Indra. (Ṛgveda, 1st
Maṇḍala, 1st Anuvāka, 1st Sūkta).
<div n="NI"/>74) {%Indra became a Goat.%} Sage Aṅgiras began wor-
shipping the Devas, hoping to have a son who will be
equal in glory to Indra. Indra who did not like
another person to be his equal, took birth himself as
the son of Aṅgiras. Savya is the name of that son.
Once Savya assumed the form of a goat and ate up the
soma plant of a sage called Medhātithi. The sage then
called him Meṣa (goat). Indra is still known by the
name, Meṣa. (Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala, 1st Anuvāka,
5 1st Sūkta).
<div n="NI"/>75) {%Indra turns woman.%} Once Indra took birth as the
daughter of a king named Vṛṣaṇāśva and assumed the
name Menā. (Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala, 1st Anuvāka,
52nd Sūkta).
<div n="NI"/>76) {%Indra and Ṛjiśvan.%} Once Indra helped a King named
Ṛjiśvā to defeat the Asuras, Karañja, Parṇaya and
Vaṃgṛda. (Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala, 1st Anuvāka,
53rd Sūkta).
<div n="NI"/>77) {%Indra and Sūrya.%} A King named Svaśva offered
prayers to Sūrya to bless him with children. Sūrya
himself took birth as his son. Once a great sage called
Etaśa got involved in a fight with this son (Sūrya).
When the sage was about to collapse, Indra came to
his rescue. (Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala, 11th Anuvāka,
62nd Sūkta).
<div n="NI"/>78) {%Indra and Saramā.%} Once an asura called Paṇi stole
some cows and hid them in some unknown place. Indra
asked Saramā, the bitch of the Devas to find out and
inform him where the cows were kept concealed. Sara-
mā replied that she was prepared to do so, if Indra
would give milk to her child and look after it in her
absence. Indra undertook that task and the bitch went
out and found out the place where the cows were hidden
and reported it to Indra, (Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala, 11th
Anuvāka, 62nd Sūkta).
<div n="NI"/>79) {%Indra and Dadhīca.%} Dadhīca (Dadhīci) was the son
of Atharva. He used to scare away the Asuras by his
terrible look. Once when he had gone to Heaven, the
earth became infested with Asuras. Indra set out to
[Page327-a+ 65]
fight them. He tried to find out whether Dadhīca had
left behind anything to be used as a weapon. “Dadhīca
had with him a horse-head”, he was told. Indra went in
search of it and at last found it in a lake at a place
called Śaraṇya. It is with its bone that he killed the
Asuras. (Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala, 13th Anuvāka, 84th
Sūkta).
<div n="NI"/>80) {%Indra and Dadhyaṅ.%} Indra taught Madhuvidyā
(The science of intoxicating drinks) to Dadhyaṅ. He
was warned by Indra that if he communicated that
lore to anyone else, his head would be cut off. Once
the Aśvinīs wanted to learn it. Since Indra had denied
Soma drinking to Aśvinīs, they were not on good terms
with Indra. So they approached Dadhyaṅ to acquire
that Knowledge. But he refused to teach them due to
his fear that Indra would cut off his head. So the
Aśvinīs cut off Dadhyaṅ's head and fixed a horse's
head in its place. With that horse-head Dadhyaṅ
taught the Aśvinīs Madhu Vidyā. After they had learnt
the knowledge, they replaced his own head after remo-
ving the horse-head. (Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala, 17th
Anuvāka, 116th Sūkta).
<div n="NI"/>81) It is said that once, in a light mood, Indra made
a mare give birth to a cow. (Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala,
18th Anuvāka, 121st Sūkta).
<div n="NI"/>82) {%Indra and Śatānīka.%} Śatānīka was a King of the
Lunar dynasty who ruled over the city of Kauśāmbī.
Indra who was highly impressed by his heroic
exploits once invited him to Devaloka to suppress
the Asuras. In the war with Asuras, Śatānīka was
killed. After that Śatānīka's son, Sahasrānīka went to
Devaloka and killed the Asuras. Indra who was pleased
declared that Sahasrānīka would marry the beautiful
Mṛgāvatī and they were married. See under Mṛgāvatī.
(Kathāsaritsāgara, Kathāmukha laṃbaka, 1st Taraṅga).
<div n="NI"/>83) {%Indra and Vāsavadattā.%} Vāsavadattā who was the
wife of Udayana was born in the world by Indra's
blessing. See under “Vāsavadattā”. (Kathāsaritsāgara,
Kathāmukha laṃbaka, 1st Taraṅga).
<div n="NI"/>84) {%Indra and Meghanāda.%} Rāvaṇa conquered the
world with the help of Brahmā's blessing. In his pride
he came into conflict with Indra. After a fierce battle,
Rāvaṇa's son, Meghanāda defeated Indra. He took
Indra to Laṅkā as a prisoner. Rāvaṇa chained Īndra's
hands and feet and tied him to his flagstaff. The Devas
in distress approached Brahmā for help. Brahmā went
to Laṅkā and secured the release of Indra. After giving
the title of Indrajit to Meghanāda, Brahmā returned to
Brahmaloka.
<div n="NI"/>Sometime before this Devendra had committed adultery
with Ahalyā, Sage Gautama's wife. At that time
Gautama had uttered a curse on him, that he would
have to spend a year in prison, chained by an enemy.
His life in Rāvaṇa's prison in Laṅkā was in fulfilment
of that curse. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>85) {%Indra and Hanūmān.%} Hanūmān, the son of Vāyu
(wind) sprang up into the sky as soon as he was born,
seeing the brilliant rising sun, and mistaking it to be
some delicious food. He saw Rāhu who was standing
near the sun and made a leap towards him. When
he came near, he saw Airāvata, Indra's elephant,
standing in Devaloka. At once he turned towards that
elephant to swallow him. Seeing the struggle between
Hanūmān and Airāvata Indra used his weapon Vajra
which cut the monkey's “hanu” (jaw bone) and he fell
[Page327-b+ 65]
down dead on the earth. Vāyu, in deep sorrow, took
the dead body of his son and went to Pātāla. When
Vāyu (wind) left the world, the creatures of the world
underwent great suffering. Then the Devas led by
Brahmā went to Pātāla, consoled Vāyu and revived
Hanūmān. Since his “Hanu” was cut with Vajra, the
monkey was named “Hanūmān” by Indra. Besides,
Indra gave him a blessing that Hanūmān would die
only when he wished. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa, Vālmīki
Rāmāyaṇa; Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa; 66th Sarga).
<div n="NI"/>86) {%Indra and Govardhana.%} For the story of how the
people of Gokula (Cowherds' colony) stopped the wor-
ship of Indra, how Indra caused a heavy shower of rain,
and how Śrī Kṛṣṇa used the Govardhana mountain as
an umbrella, see under “Kṛṣṇa”.
<div n="NI"/>87) {%Indra becomes victim of old age.%} Once the sage
Durvāsas went to Devaloka. The goddesses gave him a
grand reception at which Menakā presented him with
a garland made of fragrant flowers. The sage gave it to
Devendra. Indra placed it on Airāvata's tusk. The
fragrance of the garland attracted a large number of
bees to it. They swarmed round the head of the ele-
phant and annoyed it. Airāvata picked up the garland
trampled it under his foot, pulled it to pieces and threw
it away. Durvāsas took this as an insult to himself and
pronounced a curse that all the gods would be subject-
ed to wrinkles and grey hair of old age.
<div n="NI"/>Indra and the other gods fell victims to old age. Indra
requested Durvāsas to release him from his curse. The
sage relented and told him that if the Devas drank
Amṛta obtained by churning the ocean of milk they
would recover their youth. Accordingly, the ocean of
milk was churned by the joint effort of the Devas and
Asuras and in the end the Devas snatched it away.
When the Devas drank Amṛta, the symptoms of old age
disappeared and they recovered their youth. (Uttara
Rāmāyana).
<div n="NI"/>88) {%Indra and Daṇḍakāraṇya.%} Daṇḍa the son of Ikṣvāku,
a King of the Solar dynasty, ruled over the territory
between the Vindhya and the Himālayas. Once when
he was out ahunting in the neighbourhood of the moun-
tains, he saw a charming woman. She was “Arā”, the
daughter of the sage Śukra. The King was fascinated
by her beauty and fell desperately in love with her at
the very first sight. He seized her by force and commi-
tted rape on her. When Śukra knew about this, he was
furious and uttered a curse that Indra should shower
a rain of fire on Daṇḍa's kingdom. Thus the whole
country of Daṇḍa was destroyed by Indra's rain of fire.
In course of time that region was turned into a dense
forest and came to be called “Daṇḍakāraṇya”. (Uttara
Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>89) {%Other names of Indra.%} Indra; Marutvān, Maghavān,

<div n="NI"/>90) {%Indra's Divinity.%} In the earliest stage of Hinduism,
Indra had occupied one of the most eminent places
among the gods. Mahāviṣṇu had only the place of
younger brother of Indra at that time. In Amara Kośa
we find “Upendra Indrāvaraja” as the synonym of
[Page328-a+ 65]
Viṣṇu. In Ṛgveda Indra has a more important place.
Although Rudra is a divinity or deity and although
there are references to Kapardin, there is not even a
single stuti (praise) about Śiva in the Ṛgveda. Ṛg-
veda does not recognize Devīpūjā and idol worship.
But in the Purāṇic age, Indra was transformed into a
lascivious “Deva Prabhu” (Lord among the gods).
Sardar K.M. Panikkar, in his preface to “Ṛgveda
Saṃhitā” says about Indra:—“The main actor in Ṛg-
veda is Indra. In the war against the Dasyus the Āryas
seek the help chiefly of Indra. Indra is represented as
very handsome and of a golden complexion. His weapon
is Vajra, thunderbolt which was made by Tvaṣṭā.
Vāyu (wind) is his charioteer. He is constantly travel-
ling about in the sky driving in his golden chariot. Indra
likes drinking Soma juice more than the other gods.
Indra is even referred to as “Somapa”. He is also
sometimes described as the twin brother of Agni. Sages
have sung unendingly about the exploits of Indra.
Hiraṇyastūpa, a sage, has composed a work entitled
“Indrastuti” which celebrates many of the heroic deeds
of Indra. Indra was Vajrapāṇi who had slain the Asuras
like Ahi, Tuṣṇa, Śaṃbara, Vala, Vṛtra and others.
<div n="NI"/>There are also several stories in the Vedas about the
birth of this hero. At the time of Indra's birth, some-
how, his mother felt that he was incapable of being
killed. So she decided to abandon him. Fearing trouble
for herself, she asked the child to leave her and go to
some other place. Indra refused to do so and followed
her to the house of Tvaṣṭā. There he drank the juice
of the soma plant and gained strength to kill his ene-
mies. But unaware of this, his mother, tried to keep
him concealed. Indra, however, came out of the place
in his dazzling attire and encountered the enemies.
Vṛtra who met Indra got ready for a fight. In the fight
Vyaṃsa struck down Indra. The devas fled in fear.
Indra who was left alone called upon Viṣṇu and sought
his aid.
<div n="NI"/>Although Indra needed help in his fight with Vṛtra, he
was the chief support to the Ārynas in their fight against
the Dasyus. It was Indra's Vajra which broke up the for-
tresses of many Dasyu kings. That was why he got the
name “Purandara”. Once Indra dried up the whole
river to enable his army to cross it for the sake of Sud-
ās. When Suśravas became helpless, Indra destroyed
twenty kings and 60099 soldiers with his chariot wheel.
Thus we see Indra in the Ṛgveda as the destroyer of
the Dasyus and the protector of Āryans.”
<div n="NI"/>Indrāṇī, Śacī and Pulomajā are the names of Indra's
wife. Indra's son, Jayanta is also known by the name
of Pākaśāsani. Indra's city is Amarāvatī; his chariot
“Vimāna”, his charioteer Mātali, and his garden Nan-
danavana. “Vaijayanta” is the name of his mansion.
Indra's weapon has several other names, such as, Hrā-
dinī, Kuliśa, Bhidura, Pavi, Śatakoṭi, Svaru, Śāmba,
Dambholi, Aśani etc. Indra's assembly is called “Su-
dharmā”. Indra's bow is the rainbow, his sword is
Parañjaya and his residence is Heaven. The trees in
Heaven are, Mandāra, Pārijāta, Santāna, Kalpavṛkṣa
and Haricandana. The festival celebrated in honour of
Indra is called “Śakradhvajotthāna” or “Indrotsava”.

<div n="NI"/>96) {%Indra and Mahāśani.%} Once Mahāśani, the son of
Hiraṇya defeated the gods in a battle and took
Indra and Indrāṇī to Pātāla as captives. The
Devas who knew that Mahāśani was a relative of
Varuṇa, sought the help of Varuṇa. At the instance. of
Varuṇa, Indra was released. The revengeful
Indra prayed to Śiva. Śiva appeared and asked Indra
to submit his complaint to Viṣṇu. Indra offered his
prayers to Viṣṇu. As a result of it, a man who had the
elements of Śiva and Viṣṇu, in him, took his birth from
the water of the Gaṅgā. He killed Mahāśani. (Brah-
māṇḍa Purāṇa).
