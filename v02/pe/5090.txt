PĀTĀLA¦. The last of the seven regions or worlds under
the earth said to be peopled by Nāgas. The seven
regions one below the other are (1) Atala (2) Vitala
(3) Sutala (4) Talātala (5) Rasātala (6) Mahātala and
(7) Pātāla. In all these regions there are beautiful cities
and buildings built by Maya, the great architect. The
daityas, dānavas and nāgas live in these regions.
<div n="NI"/>Pātāla is seventy thousand yojanas high each division
being ten thousand yojanas high. The earth in these
[Page581-a+ 63]
regions is of different hue like white, black, red and
yellow. It is filled with rubbles, black granite and
gold. Once Nārada on his return to Svarga from
Pātāla said that Pātāla was more beautiful than Svarga.
The ornaments worn by nāgas are profusely studded
with shining diamonds. Daytime is lighted by the Sun
and the night by the Moon. There is neither heat nor
cold there and the happy nāgas living contentedly do
not feel the passage of time.
<div n="NI"/>Under the Pātāla is Ādiśeṣa, a tāmasic form of Mahā-
viṣṇu, known to the Siddhas as Ananta. He has a thousand
heads and Svastika as his badge. Holding in one hand
a plough and in the other a wooden pestle he sits wor-
shipped by Śrīdevī and Vāruṇīdevī. At the time of the
end of the world the Saṅkarṣaṇamūrti, Rudra, is born
from the face of Ādiśeṣa shining brightly like poisonous
fire and it consumes all the three worlds. Ādiśeṣa
worshipped by all gods bears this earth on his head
like a crown and sits in Pātāla. When Ananta yawns
this world begins to quake along with its oceans, rivers
and forests. Nobody has seen an end of his qualities
and that is why he is known as Ananta (no end). It
was by worshipping this Ananta that the ancient sage
Garga learned the truth about the results of Nimittaśā-
stra (predictions by omens) a division of Jyotiṣa-
śāstra.
<div n="NI"/>The distinguishing characteristics of each of the seven
divisions of Pātāla are given below:—
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Atala.%} The first region of Pātāla. Here lives Bala,
the celebrated son of Maya. He has created ninetysix
kinds of magical arts capable of giving everything one
desires. Those interested in magic are even now using
some of these. When Bala yawns three kinds of women
will come out of his mouth. Puṃścalīs (harlots),
Svairiṇīs (adulteresses) and Kāminīs (lustful maidens).
These women have a charm called Hāṭaka to tempt
all who enter Atala. This hāṭaka is a rasāyana which
will excite sexual passion in men so that the women
can enjoy a sexual life with them for a prolonged period.
These women after enticing the men would live with
them enjoying a life of bliss produced by bewitching side
glances, charming smiles, erotic embraces and exciting
amorous talks. The men who live with them will be
in such a state of bliss that they would say with
pride “I am perfect, I am god. I am one with the
might of ten thousand elephants.”
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Vitala.%} This is the abode of Hāṭakeśvara who is
none other than Paramaśiva. This god accompanied
by Bhavānīdevī and surrounded by pramathagaṇas
(prominent demigods who attend on him) and wor-
shipped by devas, presides over this place increasing
the prajās created by Brahmā. The semen virile of
Pārvatī-Parameśvaras flows there as the river Hāṭakī.
The gold named Hāṭaka is what is vomited by the
wind-blown Agni after drinking the rasa of that river.
The wives of daityas wear ornaments made of this
gold.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Sutala.%} This is the abode of Mahābali. Here lives
Mahābali meditating on Mahāviṣṇu with more glory
and grandeur than Indra. To please Indra, Mahā-
viṣṇu once went to Mahābali on earth and by deceit
took all his possessions and binding him with
Varuṇapāśa pushed him to Sutala through a hole made
[Page581-b+ 64]
on earth. Later Mahāviṣṇu felt he did a wrong in
thus sending away Mahābali from earth by deceit and
to remedy the sin committed he even now acts as a
gatekeeper to Mahābali in Sutala. Once Rāvaṇa
went to Sutala to attack Mahābali and then Mahāviṣṇu
keeping watch over the palace-gate in the form of
Vāmana gave Rāvaṇa a kick and sent him back.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Talātala.%} This is the place where Maya lives. This
Maya is a mighty magician among demons. After the
Tripuradahana (burning the three demons to death)
Śiva blessed Maya and the latter is living as Tripurā-
dhipati (chief of Tripura) in Talātala. Maya is the
preceptor of all demon-magicians and many fierce-
looking demons worship him always.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Mahātala.%} This is the abode of Kādraveyas. They
got the name because they are all children of Kadrū,
the cobra. All these cobras are fierce-looking multi-
headed ill-tempered ones. The prominent ones among
them are Kuhaka, Takṣaka, Suṣena and Kāliya. All
these are long lean serpents possessing big hoods and
great strength. These bad-tempered cobras live with
their family terribly afraid of Garuḍa.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Rasātala.%} This is the residence of the notorious
Nivātakavaca-Kālakeyas. They were enemies of the
devas and they tormented them in many ways. The
majestic authority of Mahāviṣṇu decreased their
virility. They are now living in Rasātala frightened by
the threats and beatings with a magic wand of Saramā,
a mantrarūpiṇi (a sacred chant incarnate) deputed by
Indra.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Pātāla.%} This is the abode of serpents. The
nāgalokādhipatis (chiefs of the serpent world) like
Vāsuki, Śaṅkha, Gulika, Śveta, Dhanañjaya Mahā-
śikha, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Saṅkhacūḍa, Kambala, Aśvadhara
and Devadatta live here. These are all strong, long-
bodied, greatly poisonous snakes with very bad tempers.
They all possess hoods varying in numbers from five to
hundred and the lustre of the diamonds on their hoods
keeps the region of Pātāla always illuminated. At the
base of this Pātāla-world is a place, separated from the
rest, thirty thousand yojanas in area. It is here that
the tāmasic Viṣṇukalā resides under the name Ananta.
Ādiśeṣa or Ananta is the manifestation of this Viṣṇu-
kalā. Śrī Ananta has got a name Saṅkarṣaṇa meaning
one who proudly and arrogantly pulls at every thing
that is seen and unseen.
<div n="NI"/>It is well-known that all the worlds are being borne on
his head by the thousand-hooded Ādiśeṣa. When,
while bearing the worlds like this, he feels that he
should destroy the animate and inanimate objects of
the worlds, he brings forth from his forehead Rudra
named Saṅkarṣaṇa with eleven demigods and weapons
like triśūla (trident). Ananta is very beautiful with
divine brilliance. Other serpent chiefs prostrate before
him and at that time they see their reflection on the
diamond-mirror-like nails on the toes of Ananta and
for some time the serpent chiefs lie there pleasantly
looking at the reflection of thier own faces in the nails.
The earrings of dazzling brilliance worn by these ser-
pent chiefs reflect on their cheeks and the serpents feel
extremely happy when they see the reflection of their
faces on the nails.
<div n="NI"/>The daughters of the serpent kings are all beautiful
damsels with fair, spotless and lustrous bodies. They
[Page582-a+ 65]
smear their bodies with fragrant pastes made from Aloe,
Sandal and Saffron. They then stand around Ādiśeṣa
with their bewitching smiles and amorous movements of
their bodies accompanied by erotic side glances express-
ing their carnal desires. The mighty, virtuous, celebrat-
ed Ādiśeṣa sits there surrounded by serpents for the
welfare of the world. He sits there worshipped by
Devas, Siddhas, Gandharvas, Vidyādharas and Maha-
rṣis, bearing the divine garland ‘Vaijayantī’, and
wearing fragrant flower garlands, blue apparels and
ornaments in ears and neck and holding in his hand the
Halāyudha. Suppressing his anger and keeping calm
and serene he pleases all around with his pathetic look.
