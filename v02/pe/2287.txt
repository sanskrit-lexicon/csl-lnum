ELI¦ AND PŪCCA. (Eli = rat, Pūcca = Cat).
<div n="NI"/>The story of the cat and the rat described by the poet
Kuñjan Nambiār is from Kathāsaritsāgara. The story
in original is the following.
<div n="NI"/>Once there lived on a big banyan tree near the city of
Vidiśā a mongoose, an owl, a cat and a rat. The mon-
goose and the rat lived in two separate hollows at the
foot of the tree, the cat in a cavity in the centre of the
tree and the owl on the branches at the top. Of these
the rat could be eaten by all the other three and the cat
could kill all the rest. The rat and the mongoose afraid
[Page270-a+ 64]
of the cat did stir out only during night time and the
cat moved about day and night afraid of none wishing
to catch hold of the rat and eat it. Their common place
of activity was a rice-field nearby.
<div n="NI"/>Once a forester laid a net to catch the cat and the cat
fell into the trap and lay there hanging inside the net.
The rat coming that way saw the plight of the cat and
jumped with joy. But soon the owl and the mongoose
came to the spot and seeing their enemy, the cat, impṛi-
soned rushed to catch hold of the rat. The rat then did
a very clever thing. It went and tore open the net
imprisoning the cat and when the cat jumped out of the
net the owl and the mongoose ran away and disappear-
ed. The rat went to its hole. This is a story to
demonstrate the fact that with a change in the situation
an enemy may turn out to be a friend. (Taraṅga 7,
Madanamañcukālaṃbaka, Kathāsaritsāgara).
