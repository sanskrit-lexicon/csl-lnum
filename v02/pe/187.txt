AMĀVĀSĪ¦. In Amarakośa we read about Amāvāsī:
“Amāvāsyā tvamāvasyā darśaḥ sūryendusaṃgamaḥ”.
Amāvāsī means New Moon. “Amā” means “Saha”.
So Amāvāsī is the Union of Sun and Moon in the same
rāśi.
<div n="NI"/>Once Bhṛgu Mahaṛsi cursed Agni. At that time Agni
explained the importance of Amāvāsī. The oblations
which are offered as homa into the fire become the food
of the Devas and Pitṛs. Substances offered as homa on
Purṇamāsī become food of the Devas and those offered
on Amāvāsī become food of the Pitṛs. (M.B., Ādi
Parva, Chapter 7).
