TVAṢṬĀ I¦. A Prajāpati. This Prajāpati was an asura
also. (Sūkta 94, Anuvāka 14, Maṇḍala 1, Ṛgveḍa).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} There are contradictory statements in the
Purāṇas regarding the birth of Tvaṣṭā.
<div n="NI"/>(a) Viśvakarmā got four sons named Ahirbudhnya,
Tvaṣṭā Ajaikapāt and Rudra. The great ascetic Viśva-
rūpa was the son of Tvaṣṭā. (Chapter 15, Aṃśa 1,
Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
[Page800-a+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>(b) Kaśyapa got as his sons the Ekādaśarudras of his wife
Surabhi. Surabhi who became pure by penance got by
the grace of Mahādeva five other sons named Aja,
Ekapāt, Ahirbudhnya, Tvaṣṭā and Rudra. The noble
and famous Viśvarūpa was the son of Tvaṣṭā. (Chapter
18, Agni Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(c) Kaśyapa Maharṣi got a son named Tvaṣṭā of his
wife Aditi. (Śloka 34, Chapter 226, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>Because of such varied statements it is not possible to
say whose son Tvaṣṭā was.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Indra's enemy.%} Even from the beginning, Tvaṣṭā
hated Indra. Tvaṣṭā begot of his wife Recanā a son
named Viśvarūpa to kill Indra. Viśvarūpa was the
younger brother of Sanniveśa. Viśvarūpa was called
Triśiras also. (See under Triśiras). While Viśvarūpa
was doing penance Indra killed him by his Vajrāyudha.
Enraged at this Tvaṣṭā produced another asura named
Vṛtra to kill Indra. (See under Vṛtra). Indra killed
Vṛtrāsura also. At last greatly disappointed Tvaṣṭā
cursed Indra that he would suffer from Putraduḥkha
(loss of son) and then went to the mount Meru to do
penance.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Tvaṣṭā also treated as a Rudra. (Chapter 15, Aṃ a
1, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
