DAMANAKAM¦. The Tātiri tree (Grislea Tomentosa).
The ceremony of worshipping this tree is called Dama-
nakārohaṇavidhi. The Grislea tree is supposed to be
Bhairava, who had been changed to a tree by the curse
of Śiva. A story to this effect occurs in the Purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>Bhairava was formed from the anger of Śiva. Bhairava,
against the will of Śiva, destroyed the devas, and so
Śiva cursed him and turned him to a Tātiri tree. It is
called Damanaka because Bhairava tried to do ‘damana’
(restraint or punishment) to the gods.
<div n="NI"/>Bhairava felt sorry at the curse of Śiva. He requested
Śiva to withdraw the curse. At last Śiva had pity on him
and said that all would worship Damanaka tree. The
method of that worship is called Damanakārohaṇa-
vidhi. It is given below:
<div n="NI"/>This tree should be worshipped on the seventh or thir-
teenth lunar day. The worshipper should go to the
tree, with those who recite mantras and spells. After
the worship is over the worshipper should say, “O,
Tree, which has originated by the power of Hari, you
come to my presence. On behalf of Śiva, and by his
order, I have to take you home.” Saying thus the
tree should be taken home and consecrated in the even-
ing in accordance with the rituals. In the house, the
Sun, Śiva and Agni should be evoked and worshipped
and then the root of the tree should be planted in the
Īśāna (N.E. point) corner of the house and when it
is planted, the spell or incantation of Vāmadeva Mantra
or Śiromantra should be recited. In the same way
the trunk with the branches of the tree is planted on
the Northern part. The fallen leaves and flowers
should be placed on the eastern side. When the root
is planted the following prayer should be uttered:
<Poem>Āmantritosi deveśa
prātaḥ kāle mayā prabho /
Kartavyastapaso lābhāḥ
Pūrṇaṃ sarvaṃ tavājñayā. //</Poem>
After that at dawn he should take bath and with obla-
tions of sweet-smelling flowers etc. should worship
Śiva. This is Damanakārohaṇavidhi. (Agni Purāṇa,
Chapter 80).
