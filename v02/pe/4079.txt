MADYA¦. Wine. There is a story in the seventh Skandha
of Devī Bhāgavata showing how Madya happened to be
an intoxicant. Once Indra sent out the Aśvinīdevas
from Devaloka and banned wine to them. They took
[Page460-b+ 65]
refuge in Cyavana a great sage. Cyavana conducted a
special Yāga and invited the Aśvinīdevas to partake of
the Yajñāṃśa. Indra objected to this and Cyavana had
to face Indra in a fight. Then Cyavana produced from
the sacrificial fire a demon named Mada and he rushed
at Indra to kill him. Indra then bowed down before
Cyavana and craved for pardon. Cyavana withdrew
the demon and tearing him into four pieces put one
each in dice, hunting, wine and women. That was how
all the four became intoxicating.
<div n="NI"/>In ancient India there were certain social conventions
regarding drinking of alcoholic preparations. All those
drinks which were intoxicants were not listed as
‘Alcohol’. Wine, honey, toddy, juice of sugarcane,
juice of Iruppa and Kuṭampuli, and sweet toddy of
palm tree were not considered alcohol. Surā (liquor)
chiefly meant Paiṣṭī (liquor made out of rice paste).
Drinking of Surā was banned to the three castes, Brāh-
maṇa, Kṣatriya and Vaiśya. If they drank Surā they
had to perform a penance for a year drinking only water
or eat long pepper for a year. To be free from the sin of
drinking Surā one should wear dress made of animal
hair. Even if one drinks water in a pot in which Surā
was taken, one should observe Vrata for seven days.
(Chapter 173, Agni Purāṇa).
