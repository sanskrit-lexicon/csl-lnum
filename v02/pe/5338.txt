<div n="NI"/>2) {%Prasena and the Syamantaka.%} Satrājit and Sūrya
(Sun) were friends. Once Satrājit requested Sūrya
to give him some gift as a token of their friendship.
Then Sūrya gave him the Syamantaka gem. If that
stone was worshipped daily with pūjās by brāhmaṇas
it would yield eight loads of gold daily. When once
Satrājit travelled by air with that gem round his neck
the people of Dvārakā mistook him for Viṣṇu. Śrī
Kṛṣṇa was attracted by the beauty and power of that
stone and he asked Satrājit that gem for a good price.
Śrī Kṛṣṇa offered as much money as he wanted and
still Satrājit did not part with it.
<div n="NI"/>Once Prasena went hunting with that gem round his
neck and he was attacked and killed by a lion. The
lion while carrying the Syamantaka was killed by
Jāmbavān and the latter carried the gem to his den
and gave it to his children to play with.
<div n="NI"/>When Prasena did not return from his hunting and
was found later lying dead without the gem the news
spread that the stone might have been stolen by
Kṛṣṇa after killing Prasena. The slander reached the
ears of Kṛṣṇa also and he went to the forest in search
of the Syamantaka. He found the cave of Jāmbavān
and on peeping in found the children of Jāmbavān
playing with the gem. Jāmbavān attacked Kṛṣṇa and
after a grim battle which lasted for several days
Jāmbavān was defeated. When he knew that it was
Kṛṣṇa who had defeated him he gave him along with
the Syamantaka his daughter Jāmbavatī also Kṛṣṇa
brought the gem and the girl to Dvārakā and gave
back the gem to Satrājit. (Chapter 38, Harivaṃśa;
Chapter 13, Part 8, Padma Purāṇa).
