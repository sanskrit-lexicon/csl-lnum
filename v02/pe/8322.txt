VIJAYALAKṢMĪ¦. One of the eight Lakṣmīs. The duty
of Vijayalakṣmī was keeping the treasury of Brahmā.
Once she showed carelessness in her duty. So Brahmā
[Page854-a+ 64]
cursed her to go and guard the gate tower of Rāvaṇa.
Accordingly Vijayalakṣmī guarded the gate of Laṅkā
under the name Laṅkālakṣmī. When she was hit by
Hanūmān she obtained her original form and returned
to the world of Devas. (See under Laṅkālakṣmī).
