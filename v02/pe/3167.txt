KALMĀṢĪ¦. A river. It was while travelling by the side
of this river, that King Drupada reached a Brāhmaṇa
village where he happened to meet Upayāja. (M.B.
Ādi Parva, Chapter 166). Mahābhārata, Sabhā Parva,
Chapter 78, Verse 16 says that it was on the bank of
this river that the sage Bhṛgu blessed Yudhiṣṭhira.
(Modern scholars believe that Kanmāṣī. is the same as
