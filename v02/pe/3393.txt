KĀŚYAPA I¦. (KAṆVA).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Two sages Kaśyapa and Kāśyapa are mention-
ed in the Purāṇas, and due to the close similarity in
the names in some Purāṇas the two names are used one
for the other. There is, therefore, considerable difficulty
in distinguishing the one from the other and unerringly
hitting upon the right person in certain contexts.
<div n="P"/>There is a very ancient sage the first cause or the
original father of all living beings in the universe. He
is described, in most of the Purāṇas, as the grandson of
Brahmā and the son of Marīci. He was the husband of
the original or first mothers of living beings, called Diti
and Aditi. The interpretation that he was called Kaśya-
pa as he used to drink Kaśyam (liquor) is not founded
on facts. No Purāṇa refers to him as a drunkard.
<div n="P"/>The sage called Kāśyapa was the foster father of
Śakuntalā. The statement that he was called Kāśyapa
as he was born in the dynasty of Kaśyapa is also not
correct. Kaṇva was not born in the dynasty of Kaśyapa.
The genealogy of Kāśyapa is as follows:
<div n="NI"/>2). {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus: Brahmā—
Atri—Candra—Budha—Purūravas—Āyus—Nahuṣa—
Yayāti—Puru—Janamejaya—Prācinvān—Pravīra—
Namasyu—Vītabhaya—Śuṇḍu—Bahuvidha—Saṃyāti
-Rahovādī—Raudrāśva—Matināra—Prītiratha—
Medhātithi—Kaṇva (Kāśyapa).
<div n="NI"/>Medhātithi was Kaṇva's father. (Śānti Parva,
Chapter 208, Verse 27). According to the Agni
Purāṇa a son called Kaṇva was born (Kāśyapa)
to Medhātithi, son of King Prītiratha of the Puru
dynasty. But, nothing about the family matters of
Kaṇva is mentioned therein. In the Mahābhārata itself
the name Kāśyapa is often used instead of Kaṇva.
[Page398-b+ 65]
From the above facts it may be understood that Kaṇva
was born as a prince, and that later on, he became a
sage. Moreover, the Agni Purāṇa says that Santurodha,
the brother of Kaṇva's father, was the father of Duṣyan-
ta. According to that Kāśyapa and Duṣyanta were the
sons of brothers, Kāśyapa being that of the elder one.
For the time being the above are the only reasonable
inferences, and the truth has to be found out by further
researches. But, one thing is certain according to the
genealogy, that Kāśyapa was born twenty generations
after Kaśyapa.
<div n="NI"/>3). {%Kāśyapa and Takṣaka.%} The story is told in the 2nd
Skandha of Devī Bhāgavata and in the Ādi Parva of
Bhārata that Takṣaka set out to bite King Parīkṣit and
Kāśyapa to cure him of Takṣaka's poison, but that
Takṣaka bribed Kāśyapa off his mission to save the
King. But, the story as such is unfounded. It was Kaś-
yapa and not Kāśyapa whom Brahmā had taught the
science of the treatment and cure of poison (see under
Kaśyapa) and, therefore, it should be Kaśyapa whom
Takṣaka bribed.
<div n="NI"/>4). {%Kaśyapa and Śakuntalā.%} See under KA. VA.
<div n="NI"/>5). {%Kāśyapa and Ṛṣyaśṛṅga.%} Father of Ṛṣyaśṛṅga was
one Kāśyapa; may be Kaśyapa or Kāśyapa. The great-
er possibility is for Kāśyapa to be the father. (See
under ṚṢYAŚṚṄGA).
<div n="NI"/>6). After a Yajña Viśvakarman made a land-gift to
Kāśyapa once. (See under KAṆVA).
