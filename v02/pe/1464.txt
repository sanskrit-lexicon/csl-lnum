CANDRĀVATĪ¦. Daughter of Sunābha, the asura.
Pradyumna, son born to Śrī Kṛṣṇa of Rukmiṇī, married
Prabhāvatī, daughter of the asura called Vajranābha.
Sunābha was the younger brother of Vajranābha.
Sunābha had two daughters called Candrāvatī and
Guṇavatī. These girls once saw Pradyumna and Prabhā-
vatī engaged in love-talk and they were attracted by
Pradyumna. They requested Prabhāvatī to select hus-
bands for them also from among the Yādavas. Prabhā-
vatī, in her childhood had learnt from Durvāsas a
mantra, the repetition of which by a woman thinking
in mind of any male would help to secure that male as the
husband for her. Prabhāvatī taught that mantra to
Candrāvatī and Guṇavatī. They thought respectively
of Gada and Sāmba and repeated the mantra with the
result that Gada married Candrāvatī and Sāmba married
Guṇavatī.
