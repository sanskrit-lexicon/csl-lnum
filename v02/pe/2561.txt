HAṂSA I¦. An incarnation of Mahā Viṣṇu in Kṛtayuga.
He instructed great sages like Sanaka on yoga in the
presence of Brahmā. He is also called yajña. (Bhāga-
vata 11th Skandha). Hamsa, who was a prajāpati as
well advised the Sādhyadevas about the means to
attain salvation and the advice is known as Haṃsagītā.
(Śānti Parva, Chapter 288).
<div n="NI"/>HAṂSA II. A son born to Kaśyapa of his wife,
Ariṣṭā. He was a Gandharva and it is believed that
Dhṛtarāṣṭra was an aṃśāvatāra of this Gandharva.
(M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 6, See also under Aṃśā-
vatāṛa).
<div n="NI"/>HAṂSA III.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} A minister of Jarāsandha. Haṃsa and
Ḍiṃbhaka were the sons of Brahmadatta, the chief of
Sālva, and they were adepts in archery. Paraśurāma
was their preceptor. (Harivaṃśa 3, 103). The
Mahābhārata calls Haṃsa's brother Ḍibhaka.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Education.%} Vicakra and Janārdana were intimate
friends of Haṃsa from their very infancy, of whom
Janārdana was the son of Mitrasaha, a friend of
Brahmadatta. Haṃsa, Ḍimbhaka and Janārdana had
their education together and their marriages also were
conducted at the same time. After some time Śiva
presented them many weapons like Rudrāstra, Mahe-
śvarāstra and Brahmaśirāstra, and also two attendants
for self-protection. (Harivaṃśa 3, 105).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Curse of Durvāsas.%} Swollen-headed and haughty on
account of Śiva's boon, Haṃsa and Ḍiṃbhaka turned
out to be a nightmare to the world, and they once
tried to give trouble to Durvāsas, who cursed them to
be killed by Mahāviṣṇu. Sometime later the sage
himself informed Śrī Kṛṣṇa about this curse of his.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Death.%} The Haṃsa brothers began an aśvamedha
(Horse Sacrifice) and deputed Janārdana to collect
the tax thereof. Śrī Kṛṣṇa alone refused to pay the
tax with the result that Haṃsa clashed with Kṛṣṇa who
killed Ḍimbhaka and kicked Haṃsa down to Pātāla.
He died there, in Pātāla of snake-bite. (Harivaṃśa 3,
128).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Grief of Jarāsandha.%} Haṃsa's death caused much
grief to Jarāsandha, and for many years after it, he shed
tears over the death of his friend. Even at the time
when Bhīmasena, during his triumphal tour of the east,
attacked Jarāsandha he remembered the dead Haṃsa
and Ḍimbhaka. (Sabhā Parva, 13, 37).
