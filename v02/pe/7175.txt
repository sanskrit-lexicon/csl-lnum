SUPĀRŚVA V¦. A mountain in Jambū Island. On the
high peak of the mountain there is a tree called
Mahākadamba from the hollows of which five great
rivers take their source. These rivers fall on the peak
of Supārśva and flow by the western side of Ilāvṛtta.
The air in an area of a hundred yojanas is fragrant as
it is mixed with the fragrance emanating from the
mouths of Devas who drink the water from the above
five rivers. (Devī Bhāgavata, 8th Skandha).
