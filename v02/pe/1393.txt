CAKṢUS II¦. A tributary of river Gaṅgā. Starting from
Viṣṇupāda (Svarga) the Gaṅgā falls into Devayāna
and thence into the moon and after flooding the whole
area it divides itself into four tributaries, viz., Sītā,
Cakṣus, Alakanandā and Bhadrā and falls into Brahma-
loka and flows in four directions. Of the four tributa-
ries the river called Cakṣus falls on the peak of Mount
Mālyavān and then flows through Ketumāla and falls
into the western sea. The Gaṅgā which flows through
India is a branch of the above-mentioned tributary,
Alakanandā. (Devī Bhāgavata, Aṣṭama Skandha).
