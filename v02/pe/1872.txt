DEVĀSURAYUDDHA¦(S) Wars between the gods and
asuras. Altogether twelve wars were fought between
the Devas and the asuras, viz. Narasiṃha, Vāmana,
Varāha, Amṛtamathana, Tārakāmaya, Āḍībaka, Trai-
pura, Andhaka, Vadha, Vṛtravadha, Dhvajapāta,
Hālāhala and Kolāhala. Hiraṇyakaśipu, the daitya
was killed by Narasiṃha. Vāmana took Mahābali
captive after measuring the three worlds in one stride.
Hiraṇyākṣa was killed in fighting in the sea by Varāha
with its tusks. Indra defeated Prahlāda and in the
Tārakāmaya war also killed his son Virocana who had
planned to kill him (Indra). As the Devas could not
kill the dānavas of Tripura, Trilocana killed them.
Vṛtra who was aided by the dānavas was killed by
Indra with the help of Viṣṇu. Indra himself killed
Vipracitti and his followers who became invisible by
māyā after the felling of the dhvaja (flag staff), and in
the course of celebrating their victory the Devas defeat-
ed Śaṇḍāmarka at the yajñāvabhṛtha (Bathing at the
close of the yajña). Thus were waged twelve wars
between the Devas and the Asuras. (Padma Purāṇa,
Part 4, Chapter 13).
