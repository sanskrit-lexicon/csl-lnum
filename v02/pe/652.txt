<div n="NI"/>The hell called Avīci is described thus: “This is the
hell meant for those who stand false witness, who take
false oath and false name. The soldiers of Yama will
push these false people into the hell of Avīci, from the
top of a mount which is a hundred yojanas (league) high.
The place of Avīci, like the waves of the ocean, is swell-
ing and falling and swaying and surging always. When
sinners fall there their bodies will be crumbled to pieces.
Their life will enter into new bodies and then the punish-
ment will be repeated again and again.” (Devī Bhāga-
vata, Skandha 8).
