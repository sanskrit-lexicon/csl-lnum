ŚVETA V¦. Son of the elder brother of King Sudeva.
There is a story of how Śveta, who was a sinner,
attained mokṣa (salvation) by a vision of sage Agastya.
Towards the end of his life, Śveta attained Mokṣa by
performing austere tapas. But since he failed to earn
God's grace by giving food to the hungry, even in
Heaven, he was tormented by hunger and thirst. His
hunger was so severe that he began eating his own flesh.
At last as suggested by Brahmā he was born again on
earth and after a visit to Agastya re-entered Heaven.
