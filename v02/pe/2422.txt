GHAṬOTKACA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Ghaṭotkaca, son of Bhīmasena played a very
important part in the story of Mahābhārata. He was,
from his very birth, a staunch friend and ally of the
Pāṇḍavas. He courted a hero's death in the great war.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} On the burning of the ‘lac Palace’ the
Pāṇḍavas escaped through a tunnel and reached a forest.
While they were sleeping on the ground, Hiḍiṃba the
Rākṣasa chief in the forest saw the Pāṇḍavas from the
top of a tree, and he deputed his sister Hiḍimbī to
bring over the Pāṇḍavas to him for food.
<div n="NI"/>Hiḍiṃbī approached the Pāṇḍavas in the guise of a
beautiful woman. She was attracted towards Bhīma
and she prayed for the return of his love, which Bhīma
refused. Impatient at the delay Hiḍiṃba rushed to-
wards the Pāṇḍavas, and in the duel that ensued
between him and Bhīma, he was killed by Bhīma.
[Page290-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>Then Hiḍiṃbī approached Kuntī and requested her to
ask Bhīma to marry her. The Pāṇḍavas agreed to the
proposal on condition that Bhīma and Hiḍiṃbī should
enjoy their honeymoon in the forest and on mountains,
but Bhīma should return to them at dusk everyday.
Ghaṭotkaca was the son born to Bhīma and Hiḍimbī,
(Ādi Parva, Chapter 155).

suitable opponent to Karṇa. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 155,

<div n="NI"/>Ghaṭotkaca grew up to become a good friend of the
Pāṇḍavas. When Hiḍiṃbī and Ghaṭotkaca took leave of
them Kuntī said to Ghaṭotkaca: “You are the eldest
son to the Pāṇḍavas. You should be ever a support to
them.” To this Ghaṭotkaca answered that he would
return to them whenever any need arose for it.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Carried the Pāṇḍavas on shoulders.%} During their exile
in the forest the Pāṇḍavas became too tired to walk any
further when Bhīma remembered Ghaṭotkaca, who
promptly appeared before the Pāṇḍavas, and at the
instance of Bhīma got down a number of Rākṣasas also.
Ghaṭotkaca carrying Pāñcālī on his shoulders, and the
Rākṣasas carrying the Pāṇḍava brothers on their
shoulders went by air to Badarikāśrama where
Naranārāyaṇas were doing tapas, landed them there,
and then they (Ghaṭotkaca and his companions) took
leave of the Pāṇḍavas. (Vana Parva, Chapter 145).

<div n="NI"/>(14) Karṇa clashed with Ghaṭotkaca and failing to
kill him by any means he (Karṇa) used Vaijayantī
Śakti as the last resort. This Śakti had been given to
him by Indra in exchange for his head-gear and ear-
rings, and Karṇa had been keeping the Śakti in res-
erve to kill Arjuna. At any rate Karṇa used it against
[Page291-a+ 65]
Ghaṭotkaca and he was killed. After killing Ghaṭot-
kaca the Śakti entered the sphere of the stars. (Droṇa
