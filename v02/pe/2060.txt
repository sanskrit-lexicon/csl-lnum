ḌIṂḌIKA¦. A rat who played a part in Biḍālopākhyāna.
The story runs as follows:
<div n="NI"/>Once a cat performed tapas, holding his hands up, on
the banks of the Ganges, when the found no way to get
food. Seeing the devotion of that cat all living beings
birds and animals began to worship him. Once the cat
called all rats and told them: “One cannot do spiritual
and physical deeds at the same time. So I will look after
your spiritual affairs. You should attend to my
physical needs. That is, bring me food, bathe me in
the Ganges, all these are your duties.”
<div n="NI"/>The rats agreed to do so. They took him to the
Ganges, bathed him and gave him food. But, the cat,
whenever he got a chance caught a rat and ate it up
The cat's health improved day-by-day and the number
of rat's began to decrease. Among them, there was a
clever rat named Ḍimḍika. He called all the other rats
[Page242-b+ 65]
and organized a secret conference. The subject of
discussion was the cruel deeds done by the cat to the
rats.
<div n="NI"/>The next day Ḍiṃḍika went secretly to examine the
ways of living of the cat. The cat ate Ḍiṃḍika. After
40 days the rats came to know that Ḍiṃḍika was
missing. They assembled secretly. They elected a rat
named Kokila as their leader. Under his leadership
the rats declared independence and left the place. The
cat also went his own way finding no means to get food.
