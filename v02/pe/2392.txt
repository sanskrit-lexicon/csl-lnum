GAVIJĀTA¦. (ŚṚṄGĪ). The son of a sage named
Nāgabhūṣaṇa, Gavijāta cursed that King Parīkṣit
should die of snake-bite. The curse was made under
the following circumstances.
<div n="NI"/>King Parīkṣit went hunting one day in the forest and
he who had chased a deer in hot haste for some dis-
tance felt naturally very weak and tired, and requested
a sage he saw there in the forest for some water.
Immersed in meditation the sage did not hear the King,
and mistaking him to be a haughty fellow, the King,
with his stick, lifted a dead snake and placed it round
the neck of the sage. Yet he did not stir. The King
returned to his palace.

<div n="NI"/>Gavijāta, son of the sage and a devotee of Devī heard
of the insult heaped on his father's head while he was
merry-making in the forest with his companions. The
companions derided him by saying that though his
father was Nāgabhūṣana (having snakes as ornament)
the nāga was I feless. Enraged at this and not waiting
to study details about the incident he pronounced the
following curse. “Whoever might be the person who
threw a dead snake about my father's neck, he will be
bitten to death by Takṣaka within seven days from
today.” Only after the curse was pronounced did he
understand that it was King Parīkṣit who had become
the object of the curse. And, he despatched his disciple
immediately to Parīkṣit to inform him about the curse.
The King's reaction was, “when the time for death
comes let me die.” (Devī Bhāgavata, Dvitīya
Skandha).
