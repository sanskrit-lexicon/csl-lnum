MENAKĀ¦. A nymph of extraordinary beauty. Taking
instructions from Indra, Menakā used to entice many
sages and destroy their power of penance. There are
innumerable stories of this kind in Purāṇas. Some
important events connected with Menakā are given
below:
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Mother of Pramadvarā.%} Once Menakā became preg-
nant by a Gandharva named Viśvāvasu. On the day she
delivered she threw the child on the banks of a river
and went to Svarga. A sage named Sthūlakeśa who was
doing penance nearby took the babe and brought it up.
When she grew up she was named Pramadvarā and
Ruru married her. (See under Pramadvarā).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth of Śakuntalā.%} When Viśvāmitra was perform-
ing penance in the forests, Menakā, under instructions
from Indra, went and enticed Viśvāmitra and broke the
continuity of his penance. A girl was born to Menakā
and became later the celebrated Śakuntalā. (See under
Śakuntalā).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Again with Viśvāmitra.%} Once again when Viśvāmitra
was performing penance in Puṣkaratīrtha, Menakā appro-
ached him and again Viśvāmitra fell in love with her and
they lived together for ten years. Then one day Viśvā-
mitra realised his folly and leaving her went again to
the forests for penance.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Maṅkaṇa was enticed%} See under Maṅkaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) When once Durvāsas visited Devaloka it was
Menakā who presented him with a flower garland. This
incident led to the churning of the milk ocean at a
later period. (See under Amṛta).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Menakā was one among the six prominent celestial
maidens. Urvaśī, Pūrvacitti, Sahajanyā, Menakā,
Ghṛtācī and Viśvācī are the six. (Śloka 68, Chapter 74,
Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Menakā attended the Janmotsava of Arjuna and
sang on the occasion. (Śloka 64, Chapter 122, Ādi

(Śloka 10, Chapter 10, Sabhā Parva).
