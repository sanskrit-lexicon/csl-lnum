DĪKṢĀ¦. Dīkṣā is the vrata that expels sin and increases
Jñāna (wisdom). Those who are to be blessed fall into
three categories. The person who belongs to the first
category is called Vijñānakala; the second is Pralaya-
kala; and the third is Sakala. Vijñānakala is free from
sin alone. Pralayakala is free from sins and Karmans.
Sakala has everything from Kalā to the earth. The
Dīkṣās to be practised by the three classes of persons
are of different kinds. Dīkṣā is classified into two:
“Nirādhāra and Sādhāra.
<div n="NI"/>Nirādhāra Dīkṣā is performed for the sake of Vijñāna-
kala and Pralayakala. Sādhāra Dīkṣā is prescribed for
the third class of people, the Sakalas.
