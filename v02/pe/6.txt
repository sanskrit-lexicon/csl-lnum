ABHIMANYU I¦. He was the heroic son of Arjuna the cen-
tral figure of the Mahābhārata, by his wife Subhadrā.

<div n="NI"/>2) {%Pūrvajanma (Previous Birth).%} There is a story about
Abhimanyu's Pūrvajanma in the Mahābhārata. It was
Varcas, son of Candra, who incarnated as Abhimanyu,
son of Arjuna. A conference took place between the
Devas and Candra about the incarnation of the Devas
in the world for the destruction of the wicked people.
Candra told the Devas: “I do not like to send Varcas,
whom I love more than my life, to the earth. Still, I
think it is not right to stand in the way of the plans of
the gods. You must agree to one condition if I am to
send my son. Let him be born as the son of Arjuna.
I am unable to be separated from him for more than
sixteen years. My son will enter into the Cakra Vyūha
of the enemies to be killed by them and return to me
in the sixteenth year.” The devas (gods) accepted this
condition. That is why Abhimanyu was killed in his
sixteenth year. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 67).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Military Training and War.%} Abhimanyu received his
training in arms from his father Arjuna. Later, he
went with his mother Subhadrā to Dvārakā and lived
for some time with his uncle Śrī Kṛṣṇa. There he is
said to have received training in arms from Pradyumna,
son of Śrī Kṛṣna. After the incognito life of the
[Page001-b+ 64]
Pāṇḍavas, Abhimanyu married Uttarā, daughter of
the King of Virāta. War broke out between Kauravas
and Pāṇḍavas. On the first day itself Abhimanyu
entered into a duel with Bṛhatbala, King of Kosala.
In the terrible conflict with Bhīṣma, Abhimanyu broke
Bhīṣma's flagstaff. After that he assisted his father Arjuna
to fight against Bhīṣma. Verses 8-13 of Chapter 55 of
Bhīṣma Parva of the Mahābhārata describe Abhi-
manyu's fight with Lakṣmaṇa in the second day's battle.
Then he took his place in the Ardha Candra Vyūha
(semi-circular phalanx) formed by Arjuna. He fought
fiercely with the Gandhāras. He attacked Śalya and kill-
ed Jayatsena, King of Magadha, along with his elephant.
We find Abhimanyu assisting Bhīmasena in M.B. Bhīṣma
Parva, Chapters 63, 64, 69 and 94. After that
Abhimanyu defeated Lakṣmaṇa in battle. Then he
defeated Vikarṇa, Citrasena and others also. Later he
took his position in the Śṛṅgāṭaka Vyūha created by
Dhṛṣṭadyumna. He started fighting with Bhagadatta.
He defeated Aṃbaṣṭha and Alaṃbuṣa. Next he fought a
duel with Sudīṣṇa. After that he encountered Duryo-
dhana, Bṛhatbala and others. M.B. Droṇa Parva,
Chapter 10, Verses 47-52 are a description of Abhi-
manyu's heroism by Dhṛtarāṣṭra. He snatched Paurava's
weapon and threw it on the ground. Next he fought
with Jayadratha and Śalya. Then he was caught in the
Cakra Vyūha (circular phalanx) of the enemies.
There he inflicted great losses upon the enemy forces.
Śalya was stunned and his brother was killed by
Abhimanyu. M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chapter 38, Verses 23
and 24 describe the flight of the Kauravas in fear. At
this stage, even Droṇācārya praised Abhimanyu's
valour. Duśśāsana fainted during his fight with Abhi-
manyu. Karṇa was defeated. Vṛṣasena, Satyaśravas
and Śalya's son, Rugmaratha were slain. Duryodhana
fled. Lakṣmaṇa was killed. Vṛndāraka, Aśvatthāmā,
Karṇa and others were amazed by this terrible valour
of Abhimanyu. Six ministers of Karṇa were slain.
Next, Aśvaketu, son of the King of Magadha was
killed. King Bhoja was also killed. Śalya was again
defeated. Śatruñjaya, Candraketu, Meghavega, Suvarcas,
Sūryabhāsa—who were all kings—were beheaded by
Abhimanyu. Śakuni was wounded by Abhimanyu's
arrow. Kālakeya, son of Subala was slain. M.B. Droṇa
Parva, Chapter 40, Verses 13 and 14 say that at this
stage, Prince Duśśāsana beat Abhimanyu to death with
his mace.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%After Death.%} M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chapter 71, Verses
12-16 say that after death Abhimanyu attained the
immortal world of the Munis (Saints). King Parīkṣit
was the son of Abhimanyu. In M.B. Svargārohaṇa
Parva, Chapter 5, Verses 18-20, we find that after his
death, Abhimanyu entered the moon in his former form
of Varcas.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Other names of Abhimanyu.%} In the Mahābhārata
Abhimanyu has been referred to by several other names,
such as ĀRJUNI, Saubhadra, Kārṣṇī, Arjunātmaja,
Śukrātmajātmaja, Arjunāpara and Phālguni.

manyu. Janamejaya was born as his son. It was Janame-

In the Bhāgavata the number mentioned is seven; but in the Malayalam version of the Bhāgavata (By Ramanujan Eluttacchan)
the number is eight. The original Bhāgavata says: “Śivaṃ Yamasaṃ. Subhadraṃ, Śāntaṃ, Kṣemaṃ, Amṛtaṃ Abhayam iti
Varṣāni teṣu girayo nadyaśca saptaivabhijñātāḥ”. In the Malayalam Bhāgavata an eighth division called Śivadaṃ is seen.</F>

jaya who performed Sarpasatra. (A yāga) Śatānīka was
the son of Janamejaya. Śatānīka had a son named
Sahasrānīka. King Udayana, the jewel of the Candra
Vaṃśa (Lunar dynasty) was born to Sahasrānīka by
the goddess Mṛgāvatī (See ‘Udayana’, stories about
this Udayana are very famous. Kālidāsa has mentioned
in his “Meghadūta” about the old rustics who thronged
the country-sides to tell and listen to Udayana stories).
