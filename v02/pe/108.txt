AIRĀVATA I¦. A large elephant, son of Irāvatī.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu in this order:—
Viṣṇu-Brahmā-Kaśyapa-Bhadramatā-Irāvatī-Airā-
vata. Kaśyapa married Dakṣa's daughter, Krodhavaśā
who bore him ten daughters. They were: Mṛgī, Mṛga-
mandā, Harī, Bhadramatā, Mātaṅgī, Śārdūlī, Svetā,
Surabhī, Sarasā and Kadru. Of these Bhadramatā had
a daughter named Irāvatī and Airāvata was her son.
Airāvata was not human in shape; he was a large ele-
phant. (See Sarga 14, Araṇyakāṇḍa, Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Indra's Vāhana.%} Indra made Airāvata his conveyance
(vāhana). Indra was Kaśyapa's son by Aditi. Airāvata
also was descended from Kaśyapa. So Indra took
Airāvata as his vāhana.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Airāvata caused the churning of the ocean of Milk.%} There
is a story of how Airāvata was responsible for the churn-
ing of the milk-ocean (Kṣīrābdhi-mathanam). Once
some maidens of devaloka presented a garland of flowers
to sage Durvāsas. When Durvāsas visited Indra's court
he gave that garland to Indra. Indra put it on the tusks
of his vāhana, Airāvata. The fragrance of the flowers
attracted a swarm of bees which became an intolerable
nuisance to Airāvata. So Airāvata tore the garland off
his tusks and hurled it away. When Durvāsas heard
this, he took it as an insult. In his anger he cursed all the
gods—the curse was that all gods should become subject
to old age and the decrepitude and infirmities of old age.
But though Durvāsas cursed the gods, he also prescribed
a remedy. The gods could redeem themselves from the
curse by drinking Amṛtam obtained from the ocean of
Milk (Mahāviṣṇu lies on the serpent, Śeṣa on this ocean).
The curse began to operate and the gods lost their peren-
nial youth. The gods then befriended the Asuras and
with their help they churned the ocean of Milk. They
got the nectar (Amṛtam), drank it and regained their
youth. (See under the word AMṚTAM).
<div n="NI"/>4) There is another story about Airāvata—A story of
how he also rose out of the ocean of Milk. It is said that
when the devas and asuras churned the ocean of Milk,
Airāvata also came up along with the other good things.
This story is narrated in the 18th Chapter of Ādi Parva
of the Mahābhārata. The explanation given is that when
Durvāsas cursed the gods, Airāvata was oppressed with
a sense of guilt because he was responsible for the curse.
So he took refuge in the ocean of Milk and there started
propitiating Mahāviṣṇu. There is however no warrant
for such an explanation in the purāṇas. But the expla-
nation sounds plausible because it explains the absence
of Airāvata during the interval between Durvāsas's
curse and the churning of the sea. Airāvata is represented
as a white elephant. It is probable that he became white
after his long residence in the ocean of Milk. This lends
some additional plausibility to the above explanation.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Airāvata, the Lord of the elephant.%} In the Viṣṇu Purāṇa
we are told how Airāvata was made the chief of all ele-
phants. When the Maharṣis had crowned Pṛthu as the
sovereign King, Brahmā gave new posts of honour to
many of the devas. He made SOMA (Moon) the lord
of the Stars and Planets, of Brahmins, Yajñas and herbs.
Kubera was made the overlord of all Kings; Varuṇa
was made the master of the seas and all water; Viṣṇu,
the lord of the Ādityas and Pāvaka (Fire) the lord of
[Page019-a+ 62]
the Vasus. Along with these Brahmā made Airāvata the
lord of all elephants. (Chapter 22, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%The breaking of Airāvata's tusks.%} There is a story of how
the tusks of Airāvata were broken narrated in the Āsura-
kāṇḍa of Skanda Purāṇa. Once an asura (demon)
named Śūrapadma attacked devaloka. A fierce battle
ensued between the gods and asuras. In the course of
this battle, Jayanta, Indra's son, was hit by an arrow
and at once he fell dead. Enraged by this Airāvata
rushed at Śūrapadma's chariot and shattered it to
pieces. Airāvata then attacked Śūrapadma who broke his
tusks and hurled him down to the earth. Airāvata lay
paralysed for a long time; then he got up, retired to a
forest and prayed to Lord Śiva. With the grace of Śiva
Airāvata regained his lost tusks and was able to return
to devaloka.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Other details about Airāvata.%} (1) There is a belief
that Airāvata is one of the eight elephants guarding the
eight zones of the universe. These eight elephants are
called the Aṣṭadiggajas. Airāvata is supposed to guard
the eastern zone. (Chapter 66, Ādi Parva, Mahā-
bhārata).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Airāvata and three other diggajas are supposed to
reside in Puṣkara Island. (Chapter 12, Bhīṣma Parva,
M.B.).
