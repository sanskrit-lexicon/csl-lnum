BHĀRATA¦ (MAHĀBHĀRATA). An epic written by
Vyāsa.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} The Mahābhārata is an epic.
Bharata is acclaimed as the first emperor of Bhārata.
The theme of this great epic is the fight between the
two lines of princes belonging to the dynasty of Bharata.
That is why the book is called Mahābhārata.
The great size of the volume and the greatness of
the wisdom contained therein have contributed much
to its getting the name, Mahābhārata. Once the
devas put the Mahābhārata in one pan of a balance
and the Vedas in the other pan. Then the devas
were convinced that the Mahābhārata weighed more
than all the Vedas put together. (Ślokas 269-271,
Chapter 1, Ādi Parva, M.B.).

over a lakh of verses. There is no subject on earth
which is not dealt with in the Mahābhārata. None of
[Page121-a+ 65]
the world's epics is so big as Mahābhārata. In size the
Mahābhārata is double that of Homer's Iliad and
Odyssey put together. The following poem about it is
worth mentioning now:
<Poem>Yathā samudro bhagavan
Yathā ca himavān giriḥ /
Khyātāvubhau ratnanidhī
Tathā bhāratamucyate //</Poem>
Mahābhārata is not a mere epic. It is a whole literature
in itself containing a philosophy which has been an
unfailing and perennial source of spiritual strength to
the people of India. Above all it has for its core the
Gītā which is perhaps the noblest of scriptures.
<div n="NI"/>The Mahābhārata comprises eighteen books, each book
being called a Parva. There are 2109 chapters in it, the
chapters differing in size. Besides, there is an annexe
called Harivaṃśa which deals with the life and history
of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Contents.%} The contents of each Parva are succinctly
given below: The Parvas are so named as to give a
hint of their central theme.
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Ādi Parva.%} (Ādi = beginning). Pāṇḍu and Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra, king of the Candra dynasty, are brothers. Bhīṣma
brought them up. Dhṛtarāṣṭra was born blind and he
got a hundred children of his wife Gāndhārī. They
were called the Kauravas. Pāṇḍu had two wives Kuntī
and Mādrī and got of them five sons called the
Pāṇḍavas headed by the eldest Yudhiṣṭhira.
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Sabhā Parva%} (Sabhā = court). The Pāṇḍavas and
Kauravas lived together in the court at Hastināpura.
There, the Kauravas entered into a game of dice with
Yudhiṣṭhira and through the deceitful tactics engineer-
ed by the keen-witted Śakuni, Yudhiṣṭhira was defeated
and he lost everything he possessed. The Pāṇḍavas
were then compelled to go into exile to the forests for
twelve years and spend another year after that incog-
nito. If they were found out during that period of
incognito they were to go into exile for another term
of twelve years. The Pāṇḍavas accompanied by Pāñcālī
left for the forests.
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%Vana Parva%} (Vana = forest). This is one of the
longest of Parvas and describes the life of the Pāṇḍavas
in the forest Kāmyaka. The well known stories ‘Nala
Carita’ and ‘Kirātārjunīya’ are told in this Parva’.
<div n="NI"/>(4) {%Virāṭa Purva.%} (Virāṭa = name of a King). The Pāṇḍav-
as after completing their term of exile in the forests spent
the year of their life in incognito at the court of King
Virāṭa. Many wonderful events took place during their
stay there and this Parva deals in detail about
them.
<div n="NI"/>(5) {%Bhīṣma Parva%} (Bhīṣma = The first Generalissimo of
the Kauravas). The great Mahābhārata war was fought
in the vast expanse of Kurukṣetra lying to the north-
west of Delhi. Bhīṣma was the first generalissimo of the
Kauravas and Dhṛṣṭadyumna of the Pāṇḍavas. Vyāsa
describes the events of the battle classifying it accord-
ing to the generalissimos of the Kaurava army giving
the four generalissimos a Parva each. Bhīṣma fought
for ten days and was struck down on the tenth day by
an arrow from Arjuna.
<div n="NI"/>(6) {%Droṇa Parva%} (Droṇa = The second Generalissimo).
When Bhīṣma fell Droṇa took charge as the supreme
commander. This Parva deals with the fight under his
command. Droṇa was killed in the end by Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna.
[Page121-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(7) {%Karṇa Parva.%} (Karṇa = The third generalissimo).
This Parva deals with the war under the command of
Karṇa. Karṇa fell in the end at the hands of Arjuna.
<div n="NI"/>(8) {%Śalya Parva.%} (Śalya = The fourth and last of the
Generalissimos). When Karṇa fell Śalya took over
charge of the Kaurava army. As the war was coming to
an end most of the big warriors of the Kaurava army
were killed. In the end Bhīma and Duryodhana met
in a grim fight with maces in which Duryodhana was
killed. This Parva deals with the final stage of the
battle.
<div n="NI"/>(10) {%Sauptika Parva.%} (Sauptika = pertaining to sleep).
This Parva tells us the tragic story of how Kṛpācārya,
Kṛtavarmā and Aśvatthāmā who were the only three
left with Duryodhana after the great battle went into
the camp of the Pāṇḍavas at night and killed all the
brave warriors of the Pāṇḍava army, excepting the
Pāṇḍavas, who were sleeping in their camp unaware of
the foul play lying ahead.
<div n="NI"/>(11) {%Strī Parva.%} (Strī = woman). This Parva deals with
the great lamentation in the battlefield, after the war,
of Gāndhārī and other women.
<div n="NI"/>(12) {%Śānti Parva.%} Yudhiṣṭhira was crowned king and
even at that time Bhīṣma was lying on his bed of arrows
awaiting death. Before taking up his duties of the state
Yudhiṣṭhira went to where the grandsire lay dying and
took his blessing and instruction in dharma. This
instruction of Bhīṣmācārya to King Yudhiṣṭhira of the
three dharmas, Rājadharma, Āpaddharma and Mokṣa-
dharma is the famous Śanti Parva.
<div n="NI"/>(13) {%Anuśāsana Parva.%} (Anuśāsana = Instruction).
Bhīṣma still on his death-bed continues his instructions
on several topics, like duty, freedom and fasting, giving
entertaining stories to illustrate the essence of his teach-
ing. This Parva is devoted to this.
<div n="NI"/>(14) {%Āśvamedhika Parva.%} (Aśvamedha = yāga conduct-
ed by emperors). This Parva deals with the yāga
conducted by Yudhiṣṭhira when he became the empe-
ror of Bhārata.
<div n="NI"/>(15) {%Āśramavāsika Parva.%} (Āśramavāsa = life in a her-
mitage). Dhṛtarāṣṭra, the blind and his wife Gāndhārī
accompanied by Kuntī left for the forests and lived
there for two years in a hermitage. One day the forest
caught fire and the three without trying to escape sat
on the ground facing eastwards in yoga posture and
calmly gave up themselves to the flames. This is dealt
with in this Parva.
<div n="NI"/>(16) {%Mausala Parva.%} (Mausala = Mace). This Parva
gives the story of how the Yādavas fought against each
other with maces and were destroyed and how
Dvārakā sank down into the ocean. It describes the
death of Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma also.
<div n="NI"/>(17) {%Mahāprasthānika Parva.%} (Mahāprasthāna = Death).
Dharmaputra entrusts his kingdom to his successor and
along with his four brothers and wife Pāñcālī sets out
on a long journey to Mahāmeru never to return. This
journey to death is detailed in this Parva.
<div n="NI"/>(18) {%Svargārohaṇa Parva.%} (Svarga = Heaven). This Parva
describes the entry of the Pāṇḍavas and their relatives
into Svarga, heaven.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Mode of Narration.%} Most of the verses in the
Mahābhārata are in the Anuṣṭup metre. At certain
places other metres also have been used. There are
prose pieces also in it. There are twenty notable pieces,
three in Ādi Parva, seven in Vana Parva, seven in Śānti
[Page122-a+ 51]
Parva and three in Anuśāsana Parva. All the pieces are
statements by realised souls. The style of the poetry is
simple and the method of presentation lively. At times
the imagination of the poet extends up to the horizon.
Though there is a flow of spiritualism throughout the
matter is purely mundane.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Authorship.%} Bhagavān Vyāsa is believed to be the
author of Mahābhārata. He was a contemporary of the
Pāṇḍavas and the Kauravas. Many of the events of the
Mahābhārata were personally witnessed by Vyāsa. He
took three years to write this book. The following
ślokas will support the above:
<Poem>Kururāja kulasthānāṃ
Dṛṣṭaṃ vṛttaṃ ca yatsthitam /
Tatsarvaṃ bhagavān Vyāso
Varṇayāmāsa Bhārate. //
(Padma purāṇa)
Tribhirvarṣaiḥ sadotthāyi
Kṛṣṇadvaipāyano muniḥ /
Mahābhāratamākhyānaṃ
Kṛtavānidamuttamam. //</Poem>
(Śloka 55, Chapter 62, Ādi Parva).
The Varāha Purāṇa states that Vyāsa composed the
Mahābhārata at a period when the end of Dvāpara
yuga merged with the dawn of the Kaliyuga. The
Bhāgavata states that Śrī Kṛṣṇa passed away on the
first day of Kaliyuga. The Bhāgavata is devoted to
admire and praise the life of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. This book also
is written by Vyāsa. This śloka found in the first Chap-
ter of Ādi Parva clears the doubt:
<Poem>Vāsudevasya māhātmyaṃ
Pāṇḍavānāṃ ca satyatām /
Durvṛttaṃ Dhārttarāṣṭrāṇāṃ
Uktavān Bhagavānṛṣiḥ. //</Poem>
The original name of the Bhārata which Vyāsa compos-
ed was ‘Jaya’. In the first Chapter of Ādi Parva is this
śloka to support this statement:
<Poem>Nārāyaṇaṃ namaskṛtya
Naraṃ caiva narottamaṃ/
Devīṃ Sarasvatīṃ caiva
Tato Jayamudīrayet//</Poem>
After the death of the Pāṇḍavas and the Kauravas the
disciples of Vyāsa, Sumantu, Jaimini, Paila, Śuka and
Vaiśampāyana gave this book great publicity. They
wrote books based on this story of Bhārata of which
only the ‘Bhārata’ of Vaiśampāyana and the Aśva-
medha Parva of Jaimini are now available.
<div n="NI"/>Vyāsa's Bhārata was first expounded by Vaiśampāyana
at the Sarpa-satra of Janamejaya. At the request of
Janamejaya, Vaiśampāyana added some more facts to
the original work known then as ‘Jaya’. Jaya with the
[Page122-b+ 69]
accretions came to be known as Bhāratasaṃhitā. Sūta
who narrated this story to Śaunaka and others at the
forest of Naimiśa added some more matter to the
Bhāratasaṃhitā and made it larger. The present
Mahābhārata is this expanded edition.
<div n="NI"/>The following facts prove that the Mahābhārata has
thus passed through three stages of evolution:
<div n="NI"/>1) This book is known by three names: Jaya, Bhārata-
saṃhitā and Mahābhārata.
<F>1) <Poem>(a) Jayo nāmetihāso'yaṃ
Śrotavyo vijigīṣuṇā (Śloka 22, Chapter 62, Ādi Parva).
(b) Caturviṃśati sāhasrīṃ
Cakre bhāratasaṃhitām
Upākhyānairvinā tāvad
Bhāratam procyate budhaiḥ
(Śloka 78, Chapter 1, Ādi Parva).
(c) Refer to the śloka given in para 1.</Poem></F>
<div n="NI"/>2) There is a reference to the three parts of the book
in Śloka 66, Chapter 1 of Ādi Parva.
<F>2) <Poem>Manvādi Bhārataṃ kecid
Āstikādi tathāpare
Tathopari carādanye
Viprāḥ samyagadhīyire.</Poem></F>
<div n="NI"/>3) There are three different opinions regarding the
total number of ślokas in the Mahābhārata. According
to Ugraśravas there are 8800 verses, according to Vyāsa
24000 verses and according to another statement a
lakh of verses.
<F>3) <Poem>Idaṃ śatasahasraṃ tu lokānām puṇyakarmaṇām
Upākhyānaiḥ saha jñeyamādyaṃ bhāratamuttamam
Caturvimśati sāhasrīṃ cakre bhāratasaṃhitām
Upākhyānairvinā tāvad bhārataṃ procyate budhaiḥ
Aṣṭau ślokasahasrāṇi Aṣṭau ślokaśatāni ca
Ahaṃ vedmi śuko vetti Sañjayo vetti vā na vā.</Poem>
(Ādi Parva, Chapter 1).</F>
<div n="NI"/>4) The narration appears to be of three different kinds,
descriptive, philosophical and oratorical, indicative of
three different authorships.
<div n="NI"/>5) Sūta and Vaiśampāyana have made accretions to
the original work ‘Jaya’ of Vyāsa.
<div n="NI"/>Viewed with these facts we are led to believe that
Vyāsa has composed only the very essence of Mahā-
bhārata comprising 8800 ślokas and that work was
known as ‘Jaya’ as referred to in the first invocatory
verse of the epic. Vaiśampāyana added a few verses of
his own and brought the number to 24,000 and gave the
book the name of ‘Bhāratasaṃhitā’. It was Sūta who
made many more additions and made the book so big
as to fetch it the name of ‘Mahābhārata’. The epic
which is now current among us contains a lakh of
verses and it took perhaps centuries to get this transfor-
mation of the book from ‘Jaya’ to ‘Mahābhārata’.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Period of publication.%} The Kali Varṣa starts from
3102 B.C. The great Mahābhārata war was fought at
a period when the end of Dvāpara yuga merged into
the dawn of Kali yuga as could be gathered from the
following verse from the epic:
<Poem>Antare caiva samprāpte
Kalidvāparayorabhūt /
Samantapañcake yuddhaṃ
Kurupāṇḍavasenayoḥ. //</Poem>
(Śloka 13, Chapter 2, Ādi Parva).
So it can be deduced that the great war was fought
round about 3102 B.C. Dhṛtarāṣṭra lived for eighteen
years after the great battle and the Pāṇḍavas ruled the
country for 36 years. (Strī Parva, M.B.). It was when
Śrī Kṛṣṇa died that the Pāṇḍavas ended their rule
and commenced the Mahāprasthāna. So it can be sur-
mised that Śrī Kṛṣṇa lived for 36 years after the war.
[Page123-a+ 62]
Śrī Kṛṣṇa died on the first day of Kali yuga, 3102 B.C.
Therefore it is clear the Mahābhārata battle was fought
in 3138 B.C. There are indications in other purāṇas
to support this theory. There was that rare phenomenon
of a Saptagraha yoga (Combination in astronomical
position of seven planets) while King Parīkṣit, son of
Arjuna, was ruling the country.
<F>1. (a) Saptarṣayo maghāyuktāḥ kāle pārikṣite śatam (Matsya purāṇa 271. 46).
(b) Te tu pārīkṣite kāle maghāsvāsan dvijottama (Visnu purāna 4, 24, 106).</F> This happened in a
month of Māgha (January) and a probe into the dates
of such previous occurrences revealed that a similar
one had happened in the month of Māgha in the years
3177 and 477 B.C. (The next one is to happen in 2223
A.D.). This phenomenon repeats itself in every hundred
years and so it is to be believed that one of the kind
happened in 3077 B.C. precisely during the period of
Parīkṣit. It is therefore confirmatory to the statement
that the great war occurred in 3138 B.C.
<div n="NI"/>The Pāṇḍavas ruled the country for 36 years after the
war and Vyāsa wrote this divine epic after the death
of the Pāṇḍavas. Vyāsa took three years to complete
his work. Therefore it can be well concluded that
Vyāsa wrote the epic in 3100 B.C. The Pāṇḍavas
commenced their Mahāprasthāna after entrusting the
administration of the state into the hands of Parīkṣit.
This must have happened in 3102 B.C. Parīkṣit ruled
the country for 60 years and so his son Janamejaya
became King in 3042 B.C. It was after two years of
his becoṃing King that he conducted the Sarpasatra
and it was at this Sarpasatra that Vaiśampāyana first
expounded ‘Jaya’ (Mahābhārata) to the sages assembl-
ed there.
<div n="NI"/>This fixing of the date of Mahābhārata is based on the
conclusions arrived at by the pandits of Bhārata, but
foreign chronologists differ from us. They argue that
it was in the 10th century B.C. that the Mahābhārata
battle took place on the strength of the following:
<div n="NI"/>The theme of the Mahābhārata is a fight between
Kurus and Pāñcālas. After the war the two join and
there is a statement in the Yajurveda of a people
formed by the merger of the two. Therefore the great
war should have happened in the 10th century B.C. It
was a period of hero-worship and songs on the heroic
deeds of the Kurus and Pāṇḍavas were sung and
handed over from one generation to the other and
gradually those songs took shape in the form of the
Mahābhārata.
<div n="NI"/>There is another school of thought. In the Mahā-
bhārata, Brahmā is given great prominence. But in
Vedic times Brahmā was not counted at all. During
the golden period of the Buddhists Brahmā had a cons-
picuous hold on Hinduism. Therefore it should be
deduced that the Mahābhārata was written during the
6th century B.C. Then there were about 8,000 verses
in the Mahābhārata.
<div n="NI"/>Towards the second stage of Mahābhārata the epic
grew in size bringing into its fold about 24,000 ślokas.
It was at this stage that the Mahābhārata got a vaiṣṇa-
vite colour and Śrī Kṛṣṇa was adored as an incarnation
of Viṣṇu. Megasthenes who visited India in 300 B.C.
records that the majority of Hindus were vaiṣṇavites
at that period. There are references in certain parts
[Page123-b+ 61]
of the Mahābhārata to Greeks and Buddhists. There-
fore a set of foreign chronologists conclude that those
portions of the Mahābhārata could have been written
only after Buddha and after the attack on Bhārata by
the Greeks i.e. by 300 B.C.
<div n="NI"/>The third stage of the Mahābhārata is its present form
and it was at this stage that it included new philosophy
in it. The Dharmasaṃhitā of Manusmṛti became popular
in the fifth century A.D. and therefore the third stage
of the Mahābhārata must have started before that, in
the 3rd century A.D.
