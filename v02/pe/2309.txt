GĀLAVA¦. A celebrated sage.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} He was a son of Viśvāmitra. He was a
brahmavādī. (Śloka 52, Chapter 4, Anuśāsana Parva.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How he got his name.%} There is no record of his origi-
nal name in any of the Purāṇas. He got his name
Gālava later. There is a story about this both in Devī-
bhāgavata and Harivaṃśa. It is as follows:
<div n="NI"/>There was once a King called Aruṇa in the family of
Māndhātā. Aruṇa got a son and he was named Satya-
vrata. (It was this Satyavrata who later became the well
famed Triśaṅku). When Satyavrata was a youngster
he once went inside the marriage hall of a brahmin and
kidnapped the bride. Furious at this evil deed of his
son the king sent him out from his palace and Satyavrata
roamed about aimlessly.
<div n="NI"/>Nature protested against this deed of the King abandon-
ing his heir and there was no rain in the country for
twelve years. The people were all put to great trouble.
Among those who suffered were the wife and children
of Viśvāmitra. Viśvāmitra had at that time gone to
the shores of the river Kauśikī, for doing penance. The
family of Viśvāmitra was in great distress living without
any means for food. The sight of the children crying
for food to appease their hunger pained their mother
much. So she decided to sell one child and feed the
others by what she got from the sale. It was better to
be without one child than all the children dying out of
hunger.
<div n="NI"/>She made a rope out of darbha leaves and tying it round
the neck of one child took it to the market for sale.
Both the mother and child were weeping profusely on
their way. Satyavrata saw them and took pity on them.
When Satyavrata heard their sad story and knew that
the woman was the wife of Viśvāmitra he told her
thus: “Oh, Venerable Lady, you need not sell this boy.
Untie the rope round his neck and throw it away. I
will look after your family till the return of your hus-
band. I will daily bring food for you all and hang it
on a tree near your āśrama.”
<div n="NI"/>The mother was extremely happy to hear this and she
at once untied the rope round the neck of the boy and
the boy from thence became known as Gālava. (For
details see under Triśaṅku).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Gurudakṣiṇā of Gālava.%} Gālava continued his educa-
tion under his father. At that time Dharmadeva to
[Page272-a+ 64]
test Viśvāmitra came to him disguised as Vasiṣṭha.
Viśvāmitra came out with rice to receive the guest but
by that time the guest had disappeared. But Viśvā-
mitra remained there with the rice for hundred years
till Dharmadeva returned. All these years Gālava looked
after Viśvāmitra's comforts. Viśvāmitra was immensely
pleased with Gālava and allowed him to go away free
without any gurudakṣiṇā when his education was over.
Gālava wanted to give some dakṣiṇā but Viśvāmitra
refused to accept it. Gālava insisted on giving and then
Viśvāmitra asked him to give whatever he liked but
Gālava wanted the Dakṣiṇā to be named. Disgusted
with this stubbornness Viśvāmitra said “Go and get me
eight hundred horses each with one of its ears black”.
Gālava was shocked to hear the demand and greatly
worried roamed about in search of horses of the type
specified. Garuḍa taking pity on his sad plight took
him to the palace of Yayāti. Hearing the story of
Gālava Yayāti sent his daughter Mādhavī with Gālava
saying that if she was given in marriage to any king he
would give him the eight hundred horses of the type
he required.
<div n="NI"/>Gālava took Mādhavī to Haryaśva, a King of the
Ikṣvāku line of Kings. Haryaśva was doing penance
at that time to obtain a child. Gālava said that Har-
yaśva would get a son of Mādhavī and he should,
therefore, accept Mādhavī and give him in return eight
hundred horses each with one ear black. Haryaśva was
amenable to the terms but the only difficulty was that
he had only two hundred horses of the type specified.
Finding this difficulty Mādhavī said “Oh, Gālava
please do not worry on that account. I have a boon from
a brahmavādī sage that I would remain a maiden
even after delivery. So give me in marriage to this
King and get two hundred horses. After giving birth
to a son to this King take me to another King and
get two hundred horses from him and then to another and
thus by giving me to four Kings you can get the eight
hundred horses you require.”
<div n="NI"/>Gālava liked this plan and so when Mādhavī gave
birth to a son he took her to Divodāsa, Rājā of Kāśī.
When a son was born to him Gālava took her to Uśīnara,
King of Bhoja. Gālava thus got six hundred horses but
there was nobody else to give him the remaining two
hundred. When Gālava was contemplating as to what
he should do next Garuḍa came to his rescue. He
advised Gālava to give six hundred horses and Mādhavī
in lieu of the remaining two hundred horses to Viśvā-
mitra. Gālava gave Viśvāmitra the horses and Mādhavī
and pleased with the gurudakṣiṇā Viśvāmitra
blessed Gālava. Viśvāmitra got a son named Aṣṭaka
of Madhavī. (See under Aṣṭaka).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Gālava and Citrasena.%} Gālava was once having his even-
ing prayers in the river when the spittings from the mouth
of Citrasena who was travelling by air above fell on
the pūjā materials of Gālava. Gālava went and com-
plained to Śrī Kṛṣṇa of this and Kṛṣṇa in haste pro-
mised to bring before Gālava the head of Citrasena
before the sun set. Nārada who heard this went and
informed Citrasena of Kṛṣṇa's vow. Citrasena was
frightened to death. But Nārada asked him not to lose
hope and advised Sandhyā and Valī, wives of Citra-
sena, to approach Subhadrā, sister of Kṛṣṇa, for pro-
tection. Both of them went to Subhadrā and made a
[Page272-b+ 64]
grand fire-pit in front of her palace. Citrasena decided
to end his life by jumping into the fire and as he was
circling the pit his wives wept loudly. Since her hus-
band Arjuna was away from the palace Subhadrā her-
self ran to the place from where she heard the cries.
When they saw Subhadrā they begged for ‘Maṅgalya-
bhikṣā’ (a boon to live with one's husband). Subhadrā
agreed to give them that. Then she heard their story
in full and only then did she realise that she had under-
taken to do the impossible. Yet, to help Subhadrā,
Arjuna agreed to protect Citrasena. When Śrī Kṛṣṇa
attacked Citrasena Arjuna defended. The fight then
ensued between Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa. Both had very
powerful and divine weapons and the world stood on
the verge of a collapse by their fight. Then Subhadrā
did a brave thing. She stood between the two and
requested for a cease-fire. Then Śrī Kṛṣṇa asked Citra-
sena to bow down and touch the feet of Gālava. Gālava
pardoned him. (Padma Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Tapodāna.%} Gālava once gave Yayāti one eighth
portion of the goodness accrued to him by his long
penance. (See Yayāti for details).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Gālava gets a horse.%} Pātālaketu, a demon, used to
give trouble to Gālava daily while he used to do
penance. Once this demon sent a deep hot breath to
the sky and then a horse fell from the sky. Soon an
unknown voice from air said, “This is a very strong
horse and it would travel many a yojana in an hour.”
Gālava took that horse and gave it to Ṛtadhvaja.
(Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 59).
