RUYYAKA¦ (RUCIKA). A Sanskrit playwright who
lived in the 12th century. He has another name
‘Rucika’ also. The book of criticism called “Alaṅkāra-
sarvasva” is written by him. He was the teacher of
Maṅkha, the author of Śrīkaṇṭhacarita’. Some are of
opinion that Ruyyaka had written only the Sūtras in
the book ‘Alaṅkārasarvasva’ and that the gloss or
commentary was given by Maṅkha. Some of the other
works of Rucika are Sahṛdayalīlā, Alaṅkārānusaraṇī
etc.
