BHADRAKĀLĪ¦. Another form of Pārvatī.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Lord Śiva, on hearing about the self-
immolation in fire of his wife, Satī at the famous yajña
conducted by Dakṣa rushed in all anger to the spot,
[Page109-b+ 65]
and beat the earth with his matted hair, and there ensu-
ed two forces called Vīrabhadra and Bhadrakālī. This
Bhadrakālī was really Satī or Pārvatī in another form.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Bhadrakālī and Kaṃsa.%} There is a story in the Daśama-
Skandha of Bhāgavata that Kaṃsa took away from
the room in which Devakī had delivered Śrī Kṛṣṇa the
child of Yaśodā by whom Kṛṣṇa had been replaced,
and dashed the child against a rock, and that the
child then escaped from his clutches and rose up to the
sky. That child was Bhadrakālī in another form. (Agni
Purāṇa, Chapter 12).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Kampa, Laṅkālakṣmī and Bhadrakālī.%} Laṅkālakṣmī,
who was guarding the city of Laṅkā, was the first to
prevent Hanumān from entering the city. Tamil
Purāṇas aver that this Laṅkālakṣmī was an incarnation
of Bhadrakālī. Hanumān thrashed Laṅkālakṣmī with
his left hand at which she vomitted blood and fell down
unconscious. On regaining consciousness remembrance
of the past occurred to her, and after thanking Hanumān,
who restored her to her former form, she returned to
Kailāsa. She complained to Śiva that she could not
witness the Rāma-Rāvaṇa war. Then Śiva told her
thus:
<div n="NI"/>“You go to the Drāviḍa country and be put up in the
‘Svayambhūliṅga’ temple there. I shall be born there
as Kampa, compose the Rāmāyaṇa in Tamil and get
conducted the dolls-play. Then you would be able to
enjoy the story of Śrī Rāma, especially the Rāma-Rāvaṇa
war, both by hearing and seeing the same in better
manner than by actually seeing the war.
<div n="NI"/>Bhadrakālī acted according to this bidding of Śiva.
There lived a great scholar named Saṅkaranārāyaṇa
close to the temple. His wife was Ciṅkāravallī. Lord
Śiva, as decided upon previously was born as the son
of Ciṅkāravallī, who had become a widow while she
was worshipping ‘Svayambhūdeva’ for the gift of a
child. But, Ciṅkāravallī, who feared scandal in her,
a widow, becoming a mother, forsook the child in the
temple precincts and left the place. One Gaṇeśakaunta
sighted the orphan child, and took it to Jayappavallan,
the Kaunta chief. The Kaunta chief, who was without
children brought up the orphan child as though it had
been his own child. Since the child was recovered from
the foot of the flagstaff it was named Kampa. Kampa,
who was very intelligent even in his infancy, but lazy by
nature turned out to be a great scholar and good poet
in Tamil by the time he grew up to be a youth, and
he became, consequently a prominent member in the
‘poets’ assembly’ of King Cola. When to his name was
added the plural suffix ‘r’ as a token of great respect
he came to be known as Kampar.
<div n="NI"/>Once King Cola asked Kampar and Oṭṭakkūtta another
member of the poets’ assembly to compose in Tamil
poetry the story of Śrī Rāma. The King's direction was
that. Oṭṭakkūtta should compose his poem upto the
incident, Setubandhana (building a bridge in the sea up
to Laṅkā) and Kampar should write the story of the
war in his poem. Oṭṭakkūtta completed the task allotted
to him within six months. But Kampar had not attempt-
ed to write even a single line. Having been informed
about the matter the King ordered that the poem, Rāmā-
yaṇa should be recited in the assembly the very next
day itself. Kampar, who began writing his poem the
same day with the object of completing it in the night
itself fell asleep without writing anything at all. When
[Page110-a+ 65]
Kampar awoke early in the morning he saw a divine
form disappearing from his room, and exclaimed, “Oh!
mother! you have slipped away”. To this the divine
form replies, “Oh Kampar! I have finished writing”.
And, then the divine form vanished completely.
<div n="NI"/>When Kampar got completely out of sleep and looked
about he found the Rāmāyaṇa story fully written in
verse on his desk. Kampar inferred that the poem was
composed by Śāradābhagavatī, the presiding deity of
learning and literature, and he was wonder-struck. He
recited the poem in the royal assembly, and the King
and others too were wonder-struck. And, afterwards,
according to the orders of the King the story of the war
(Yuddhakāṇḍa Kathā) began to be exhibited as dolls-
play in the presence of the idol of the Devī in the
temple. Thus Śiva incarnated himself as Kampar,
recited the story of the Rāma-Rāvaṇa war in the temple,
and hearing it Bhadrakālī danced.
<div n="NI"/>The above is the chief legend about Kampar.
