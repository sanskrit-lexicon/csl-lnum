MĀRKAṆḌEYA¦ (M). A famous holy place. This
place is situated about sixteen miles to the north of
Kāśī at a place where the rivers Gaṅgā and Gomatī
meet. He who visits this place would get the benefit
of doing an Agniṣṭomayajña. Not only that, he would
lift the prestige of his family. (Śloka 80, Chapter 34,
Vana Parva).
