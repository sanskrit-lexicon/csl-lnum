KUMUDVATĪ II¦. Wife of Kuśa, son of Śrī Rāma.
Kuśa lost the ornaments on his hands in water once
while he was sporting in the river. Angry at the loss
Kuśa was about to shoot his arrows at the Sarayū when
the nāga called Kumuda not only returned to him his
lost ornaments but also gave Kumudvatī as wife to him.
