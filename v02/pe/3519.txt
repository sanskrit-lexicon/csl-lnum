KHĀṆḌIKYA¦. A Kṣatriya King. Keśidhvaja was the
son of his paternal uncle. Both had learned well the
ways of union with the divine life. Khāṇḍikya had be-
come an expert in Karmayoga (the path of action) for
becoming one with the divine life whereas Keśidhvaja
tried to achieve oneness with divine life by Jñāna
[Page410-a+ 65]
Yoga (the path of knowledge or spiritual attainment).
Each desired to subdue the other. Consequently
Khāṇḍikya lost his kingdom and had to live in a forest
with his priest and minister. (Bhāgavata, Skandhas 9
and 13).
<div n="NI"/>Keśidhvaja who tried the path of knowledge to attain
Absolution performed several sacrifices for that purpose
and cut himself asunder from the bonds of action. Once,
while he was performing a sacrifice, a tiger came to the
place of sacrifice and killed the sacrificial cow. Then
Keśidhvaja asked the priests who were conducting the
sacrifice, what the atonement was for the death of the
sacrificial cow. The priests sent the King to the hermit
Kaśeru, who sent the King to the hermit Bhṛgu. Hermit
Bhṛgu in his turn sent the King to the hermit Śunaka.
But the matter did not end there. The hermit Śunaka
could not dictate the atonement for the death of the
sacrificial cow. So he sent the King to Khāṇḍikya who
was living in the forest. The moment Khāṇḍikya saw
Keśidhvaja he stood ready to kill him. But Keśidhvaja
revealed everything to Khāṇḍikya, When he under-
stood the situation Khāṇḍikya told him with sincerity
the rites given in the Śāstras (Vedāṅgas) to atone the
death of the sacrificial cow.
<div n="NI"/>Keśidhvaja returned and completed the sacrifice. The
one item of ‘gift to the teacher’ alone remained. So Keśī-
dhvaja came to the forest again. Khāṇḍikya raised the
sword to cut him. Keśidhvaja said that he had come to
give Gurudakṣiṇā to the teacher. Khāṇḍikya repented
his rashness and requested Keśidhvaja to tell him the
ways of cutting himself asunder from the bonds of
sorrow and grief. Keśidhvaja advised him the ways to
obtain eternal bliss. (Nārada Purāṇa).
