ŚĀLMALIDVĪPA¦. One of the seven islands.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Śālmali island, which is double in extent
of Plakṣa island is surrounded by Ikṣurasa (sugar-cane
juice) ocean on all four sides of it. There are seven
mountains there which produce gems and they are
seven boundaries which separate the regions. Just like
this, there are also seven rivers there. The seven rivers are
Yoni, Toyā, Vitṛṇā, Candrā, Muktā, Vimocanī and
Nirvṛti. Mere remembrance of the seven rivers is
sufficient to annihilate all sins. Here people
divided into the four classes live. Brahmins, Kṣatriyas
Vaiśyas and Śūdras here are called Kapilas, Aruṇas,
Pītas and Kṛṣṇas. These devout people worship Viṣṇu
in the form of Vāyu by sublime yajñas. Devas are ever
present on this most beautiful island. A tree named
Sālmali which gives mental comfort grows in this
island. The island is surrounded on all four sides by
an ocean of Surā (liquor). (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part II,
Chapter 4).
