ASIPATRAVANA¦. One of the notorious twentyeight
hells. If you destroy forests without purpose you will go
to this hell. (Chapter 6, Anuśāsana Parva 2, Viṣṇu
Purāṇa). The Devī Bhāgavata describes Asipatravana
like this: “Those who forsake their own natural duty
and go in for that of others are thrown into this hell;
they die by the orderlies of Yama, the King of Death.
There they will be whipped by a whip made of thorny
herbs and as they run about with pain they will be
followed and whipped. Crashing against the big stones
there they will fall fainting and the moment they wake
up from the faint they will be stabbed again. This
will be repeated. (Aṣṭama Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
