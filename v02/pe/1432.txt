CANDRA IV¦. (CANDRA DEVA).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} The child born to Atri by Anasuyā. (See
Purūravas). In Skandha 4 of the Devībhāgavata it is
stated that it was Brahman who was born as Candra.
(See Atri).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Candra led married life with the wife of his guru.%} Tārā,
the very beautiful wife of Bṛhaspati, preceptor of the
Devas happened to reach Candra's home during her
perambulation one day. Candra and Tārā fell in love
with each other at first sight and lived in conjugal
happiness. And thus days passed by. Bṛhaspati, being
informed of the fact on enquiry, deputed his disciples
to bring Tārā back, but to no purpose. Bṛhaspati sent
his disciples again and again to Tārā, but all to no
purpose. Then Bṛhaspati himself went to the house of
Candra and invited Tārā, this time also to no purpose.
Enraged at this the Deva guru spoke to Candra as
follows: “The brahmin-killer, gold-thief, drunkard, he
who marries another's wife and he who associates him-
self with the above three types are responsible for the
most terrible five sins, and you, therefore, are not fit
enough to reside in Devaloka. Unless you return my
wife to me I will curse you.” None of the threats of
Bṛhaspati could shake Candra. He told the Devaguru
that Tārā who had gone to his house on her own accord
would also leave him when she was satiated with him.
These words of Candra made Bṛhaspati all the more
angry. He returned home and waited sometime more
for Tārā's return. But, he got disappointed, and getting
impatient he started again for Candra's house. But,
this time the gatekeepers did not let him in.
<div n="NI"/>Terribly angry at the cruel rebuff Bṛhaspati sought
help of Indra. Indra sent word to Candra asking him
to send Tārā back home or be prepared for war. Even
then Candra refused to yield, and Indra started for
war against Candra. But, there was somehow some dif-
ference among the devas about all this, and the news
reached the asuras. At once Śukra, preceptor of the
asuras and an old enemy of Bṛhaspati met Candra and
[Page171-b+ 65]
assured him all support in case war broke out between
Indra and Candra. He also strongly advised Candra
not to return Tārā to Bṛhaspati. And, ultimately a
fierce war began between Indra and Candra. All acti-
vities in the world were thrown into confusion and
chaos. At this Brahmā on his haṃsa (swan) came to
the scene and admonished Candra and Śukra. They
could not but obey Brahmā and so were forced to stop
fighting. Moreover, Candra returned Tārā to Bṛhas-
pati.
<div n="NI"/>The quarrel and fighting thus ended for the time
being, but another problem cropped up. At the time
Candra returned Tārā to Bṛhaspati she was carrying,
and Bṛhaspati was not aware of the fact. And at last
Tārā delivered an exceptionally beautiful male child.
The naming ceremony of the child was duly performed,
Bṛhaspati himself acting as its father. When the news
reached Candra he sent a messenger to Bṛhaspati
claiming the child was his. Bṛhaspati too claimed its
fatherhood. This controversy developed almost to the
brink of a second devāsura war. At this stage Brahmā
went to Bṛhaspati's house and questioned Tārā as to
who really was her child's father, and she named Candra.
Upon this Brahmā asked Bṛhaspati to release the child
to Candra. Bṛhaspati did so. (Devī Bhāgavata, Pratha-
ma Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Wives of Candra.%} Candra took twentyseven daugh-
ters of Dakṣa as his wives. (Devī Bhāgavata, Saptama
Skandha). These twentyseven wives are the twenty-
seven stars. Candra circumambulates Mahāmeru along
with these, his twentyseven wives (Stars). (M.B. Vana
Parva, Chapter 163, Verse 33). The names of the
twentyseven wives are given hereunder: Aśvinī, Bha-
raṇī, Kṛttikā, Rohiṇī, Mṛgaśiras, Ārdrā, Punarvasu,
Puṣya, Āśleṣā, Janakaṃ, Phālgunī, Uttaraphālgunī,
Hasta, Citrā, Svāti, Viśākhā, Anurādhā, Jyeṣṭhā,
Mūlā, Purvāṣāḍhā, Uttarāṣāḍhā, Śroṇā, Śraviṣṭha,
Pracetas, Pūrvaproṣṭhapadā, Uttaraproṣṭhapadā,
Revatī.
<div n="NI"/>{%Solar eclipse according to the Purāṇas.%} The Devas and
the asuras jointly churned Kṣīrābdhi wherefrom emerg-
ed Dhanvantari with the Amṛtakumbha (pot of nectar).
(See Amṛtam).
<div n="NI"/>But an asura māyāvī (magician) called Saiṃhikeya
absconded to Pātāla with the Amṛtakumbha which
nobody noticed as everybody was busy with dividing
other divine objects. Only after the māyāvī's disap-
pearance was it noticed that the Amṛta Kumbha was
missing. At once Mahāviṣṇu assumed the figure of a
beautiful woman, got back the Kumbha and gave it to
the devas. The devas began drinking the amṛtam when,
at the instance of some other devas, Saiṃhikeya, the
māyāvī assuming the form of an old brahmin reached
svarga, got a share of the amṛta and began to drink it.
Sūrya and Candra (Sun and Moon) who were on
guard at the gates divined the secret of the ‘old
brahmin’ and informed Mahāviṣṇu about it. He cut
the throat of the pseudo-brahmin with his Sudarśana
Cakra. But, half of the nectar he had drunk stayed
above the throat and the other half below it. Therefore,
though the head and the trunk were severed they
remained alive. These two parts, in course of time,
evolved as Rāhu and Ketu.
<div n="NI"/>When the throat was cut some blood as well as some
amṛta dropped on two places on the ground, and they
[Page172-a+ 64]
became the red onion and the white onion respecti-
vely. Some vaidika brahmins used to consider the red
onion objectionable for consumption as it was evolved
from blood, while the white onion was considered
usable as it was evolved from amṛtam.
<div n="NI"/>Ṛāhu and Ketu still maintain their hatred for Sūrya
and Candra who had betrayed the asura, who, disguis-
ed as brahmin tried to drink the amṛta. Eclipse is the
phenomenon of Rāhu and Ketu swallowing Sūrya and
Candra as and when opportunity presents itself for it.
But, since the throat is severed from the body, Sūrya
and Candra thus swallowed get out through the throat.
That is the reason why Sūrya and Candra become
visible after the eclipse in over. (Kampa Rāmāyaṇa,
Yuddha Kāṇḍa and Bhāgavata Aṣṭama Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Candra besame Calf.%} Once emperor Pṛthu trans-
formed Bhāmidevī into a cow and milked from her all
things and provisions. On that occasion it was Brahmā,
who acted as Calf. And, following Pṛthu when the
Ṛṣis milked the cow Candra served as Calf. (For
details see Pṛthu).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Waxing and waning of Candra, the purāṇic story regard-%}
{%ding it.%} Of the twentyseven daughters of Dakṣa whom
Candra had married he loved Rohiṇī much more than
the other twentysix wives, and so kept her always with
him. This annoyed the twentysix wives, who complained
about it to Dakṣa. Dakṣa's advice to Candra to treat
all the wives on an equal footing had no effect on him.
So, the twentysix neglected wives again complained to
Dakṣa as follows: “We shall stay in the āśrama and
serve you. Soma (Candra) does not associate with us,
he will not accept your advice.”
<div n="NI"/>Though Dakṣa warned Candra a second time, that too
had no effect on him. So the twentysix wives, for the
third time, complained to Dakṣa. Dakṣa got angry at
this and cursed that Candra should suffer from tuber-
culosis. Thus Candra was afflicted by consumption.
Though Candra performed many a yajña to get cured
of the fell disease, they did not produce the desired
effect. Candra remaining a tubercular patient, the
growth of medicinal plants stopped with the result that
all living things contracted consumption. When people
began becoming thinner, the devas asked Candra for
an explanation, and he told them all the details. They
then sought the help of Dakṣa, who gave Candra
redemption from the curse by ordaining that if he dived
in the Sarasvatī tīrtha in the western sea he would be
free from consumption for half of every month. Thence-
forth Candra made it a practice to dive in the Saras-
vatītīrtha and that is the reason why Candra is exempt-
ed from Kṣayaroga for fifteen days. (M.B. Śalya Parva,
Chapter 35).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Candra—King of stars and of medicines.%} During the
reign of emperor Pṛthu, he changed Bhūmidevī into a
cow. Later the Ṛṣis also changed bhūmidevī into a
cow and milked her. It was Candra who served as
calf then. Pleased at this Brahman crowned Candra as
king of the stars and medicines. (Harivaṃśa, Chapter
4, Verse 2).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Other information about Candra%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) Candra is 11,000 sq. yojanas in area, 33,000 yojanas
in circumference and a volume of 5,900 cubic yojanas.
(M.B. Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 12).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Candra presented two attendants called Maṇi and
[Page172-b+ 65]
Sumati to Subrahmaṇya (Śalya Parva, Chapter 45,
Verse 32).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Candra once made a discourse on the superior
qualities of brahmins to Śambarāsura. (Anuśāsana
Parva, Chapter 36, Verse 13, Southern Text).
<div n="NI"/>(4) All welfare and prosperity accrue to him, who on
full-moon day at moon-rise tenders offerings to Candra
of bread in copper vessels with honey poured into it.
(Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 36, Verse, 13, Southern
Text).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Candra is one of the aṣṭa-vasus. Candra had
four sons, Varcas, Śiśira, Prāṇa and Ramaṇa by his
wife named Manoharā. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 66,
Verse 18).
<div n="NI"/>(6) Abhimanyu was Candra's son, Varcas, reborn as
the son of Arjuna. (See Abhimanyu).
