given below:—
<div n="NI"/>Once Brahmā performed a sacrifice on the island of
Puṣkara. All the devas (gods and goddesses) attended
the sacrifice. Among the rivers, Sarasvatī alone did
[Page692-a+ 64]
not come at first. Then Brahmā remembered
Sarasvatī and she appeared under the name Suprabhā.
Thus she appeared before the hermits who were doing
penance in that place assuming seven different figures.
From that day onwards the place became famous under
the name Saptasārasvata. (See under Sarasvatī).
