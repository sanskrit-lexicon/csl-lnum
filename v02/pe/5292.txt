PRAMADVARĀ¦. Wife of Ruru.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Pramadvarā was the daughter of the nymph
Menakā born of the Gandharva Viśvāvasu. As soon
as the child was born, Menakā threw the child into
the forest and left for Devaloka.
[Page601-a+ 65]
Sthūlakeśa, a sage who was engaged in penance in that
forest in a hermitage heard the cry of a child and
came out of his āśrama. On seeing a new-born child
lying unclaimed and uncared for, he took the child to
his āśrama and named her Pramadvarā and brought
her up. She grew into a charming maiden and
one day Prince Ruru coming that way while hunting
saw her and fell in love with her. The sage was pleased
to give her in marriage to the King and so fixed the
date of marriage.
<div n="NI"/>The day previous to her marriage she trampled over
a poisonous snake while walking in the forest with her
companions and immediately she fell dead by the bite
of the serpent. Ruru's grief was uncontrollable.
He wept bitterly crying aloud “If I have from my very
birth with great devotion taken vows, let Pramadvarā
rise up alive.” Then a devadūta (messenger from god)
appeared before him and said that all his wails were of
no avail since it was only in the order of things that
one whose āyus (period of life on earth) was over
should die. Ruru then enquired of him a way of escape
from this inevitable calamity and then the devadūta said
that if Ruru was prepared to surrender half of his āyus
in favour of Pramadvarā she would come back to life.
Ruru agreed and they went to Dharmarāja (god of
Death) and told him of his wish. Dharmarāja brought
back Pramadvarā to life and she stood before Ruru
as if just woken up from sleep. Their marriage was duly
conducted. (Chapters 8 and 9, Ādi Parva).
