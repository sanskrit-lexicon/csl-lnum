CANDRAHĀSA¦ (M). Rāvaṇa's sword. Rāvaṇa, in the
course of his triumphal tour after receiving the boons
from Brahman, subjugated kings, and marching north-
ward reached the valleys of Mount Kailāsa. But, Nandi-
keśvara stopped him there, and Rāvaṇa, threatening to
throw away Śiva, master of Nandikeśvara along with
Kailāsa, put his twenty hands under it to pull it out,
and the great mountain shook violently. Pārvatī got
frightened and running upto Śiva embraced him.
Śiva, who divined the reason for all these with his eye of
supreme knowledge grounded the mountain firmly on
earth, crushing Rāvaṇa's hands under it. Unable to
take away his arms from under the mountain, Rāvaṇa
remained there for about thousand years singing the
praises of the Lord. At last Śiva appeared to Rāvaṇa
and presented him with a sword called Candrahāsa.
It was this sword which won victories for Rāvaṇa in
future wars. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
