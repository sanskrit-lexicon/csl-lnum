SATYA IV¦. A hermit in the country of Vidarbha, This
hermit who was a brahmin was a believer in ahiṃsā also.
Once he performed a sacrifice without any killing. His
wife Puṣkaradhāriṇī helped him in the sacrifice. Dharma-
deva came there in the form of an antelope to test the
non-killing principle of Satya. The animal came near
Satya and said: “I am a deva (god) belonging to the
Śukra-clan. I dwell in this forest as an antelope, due
to the curse of Dharmadeva. Kill me and complete
this sacrifice.”
<div n="NI"/>Though Satya heard this, he did not wish to kill the
animal. At last the antelope decided to go and walked
eight steps and then returned. Due to the delusive
arts of the antelope Satya saw there celestial maids
and the aeroplanes of Gandharvas. The antelope said
that if he was killed he would attain heaven. A desire
arose in Satya for killing and forthwith he lost all the
attainments he got by penance. (M.B. Śānti Parva.
Chapter 272).
