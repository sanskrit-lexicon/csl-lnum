KUMĀRAVANA¦ (M). The place where King
Sudyumna got changed into a woman. When once
Sanaka and other sages went to Kumāravana to see
Śiva he was seated there with Pārvatī on his lap.
Seeing the sages Pārvatī got angry and cursed that
men who entered the forest in future would be turned
into women. King Sudyumna went to hunt in the
forest ignorant of this curse, and as soon as he set foot
in the forest he was turned into a woman.
Purūravas was the son born to this woman by Budha.
(Devī Bhāgavata, 1st Skandha).
