SAṂJÑĀ¦. Wife of Sun (Sūrya).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Saṃjñā was the daughter of Viśvakarman
according to the Viṣṇu Purāṇa (Part 3, Chapter 2) and
of Tvaṣṭā according to Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva
(Chapter 66, Verse 35). Most of the Purāṇas refer to
Saṃjñā as the daughter of Viśvakarman.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Separation from husband.%} Saṃjñā lacked the power to
put up with the heat of Sūrya. She once went into the
forest to perform Tapas after deputing her companion,
Chāyā, to serve her husband. Saṃjñā left her three
sons Manu, Yama, and Yamī also in the charge of
Chāyā, who in the guise of Saṃjñā served Sūrya. He
took her to be his wife and begot three children, Śanaiś-
cara, (another) Manu and Tapatī of her. Chāyā once
got angry and cursed Yama, son of Saṃjñā. Then it
was that Sūrya realised that she was not his wife.
Sūrya felt very sad at this separation from his wife and
went to the forest in search of her. He knew, by the
power of his meditation, that Saṃjñā was doing tapas
in the guise of a mare. Then he assumed the form of a
horse and begot of the mare the Aśvinīkumāras and
Revanta. The Aśvinīkumāras named Nāsatya and Dasra,
were born through the mare's (Saṃjñā) nose. (Anuśā-
sana Parva, Chapter 150, Verse 17).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Reunion.%} Sūrya brought Saṃjñā back with him. She
complained to her father Viśvakarman, that life with
Sūrya was impossible on account of his excessive heat,
and so Viśvakarman ground Sūrya on his drilling
machine and reduced his heat. But, only (1/8) of the heat
(effulgence) could be so reduced, and it was with that
fraction of effulgence that Viṣṇu's disc (cakra), Śiva's
triśūla (trident), Kubera's puṣpakavimāna and Subrah-
maṇya's weapon called Śakti were made. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa
Part 3, Chapter 2; Harivaṃśa, Chapter 41 and Bhaviṣya
Purāṇa For details see under Tapatī.
