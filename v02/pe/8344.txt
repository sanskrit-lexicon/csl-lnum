VIKUṆḌALA¦. A Vaiśya who obtained heaven by
bathing during the month Māgha in the waters of
Kālindī. This Vaiśya was a deplorable sinner. Still the
men of Kāla (Yama) sent Vikuṇḍala to heaven without
minding his sins. This story occurs in Padma Purāṇa,
Ādi Khaṇḍa, Chapter 30, as follows:
<div n="NI"/>In days of old there lived a Vaiśya named Hema-
kuṇḍala in the great kingdom of Niṣadha. He was a
devotee and worshipper of devas and Brāhmaṇas. He
carried on trade and agriculture and by plundering
he amassed much wealth.
<div n="NI"/>Hemakuṇḍala grew old. He thought about the frailty
of life and spent a sixth part of his wealth for charitable
purposes. For remission of the sins committed through-
out the whole of his life, he gave alms as stipulated
in the Purāṇas. After entrusting the family affairs to
his sons Śrīkuṇḍala and Vikuṇḍala, he went to the
forests for penance.
<div n="NI"/>His sons were young. They turned away from
righteous ways and followed a path of pleasures and
wickedness. They refused to pay any heed to the
advice of their elders. Drinking and going to other
women became their routine.
<div n="NI"/>Within a short time they lost their wealth. They had
nothing to eat. Their friends and favourites all discard-
ed them. Being forsaken by every body, they engaged
themselves in theft or robbery. They were afraid of
the king and the people, and so they shifted to the
forest. They lived by hunting. At this time the elder
brother was caught by a tiger. The younger brother
was bitten by a snake. Thus, on the same day, both
sinners met with death. The messengers of Yama took
both of them to the world of Yama. According to the
order of King Dharma, Vikuṇḍala got heaven and
Śrī Kuṇḍala got hell.
<div n="NI"/>Vikuṇḍala who was glad at obtaining heaven asked the
men of Yama on the way, why he was given heaven.
They replied, “There was a Brahmin who was well-
versed in all branches of knowledge. He was the son
of Harimitra. His hermitage was on the southern
bank of Yamunā. Yourself and the Brahmin became
friends in the forest. Because of that friendship you
were enabled to take bath in two Māgha months in
the holy waters of Kālindī which is capable of washing
all the sins away. By the first Māgha bath you got
remission of your sins. By the second Māgha-bath
you became eligible for the attainment of heaven.”
