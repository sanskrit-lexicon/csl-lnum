KĪRTISENĀ¦. A heroine who has firmly established her
reputation in Sanskrit literature. An exceptionally
good woman, Kīrtisenā was the daughter of a merchant
called Dhanapāla in Pāṭalīputra, and was married by
another merchant called Devasena. Once Devasena
left the country for purposes of trade, and during his
absence from home the mother-in-law of Kīrtisenā shut
her up in a dark room. But, with the help of an iron
rod, which fortunately came to her hands she made a
hole in the room at night, and through it escaped
from captivity. Hungry and thirsty, Kīrtisenā travelled
a long distance in the forest, and at night climbed a
tree and rested thereon. Presently a Rākṣasa woman
with her children came to the foot of the tree.
<div n="NI"/>During this period the King of Vasudattapura was
suffering from pain in the head because a bug entered
his ear and multiplied there in numbers. All the
physicians gave up the case as incurable. But, the
Rākṣasī at the foot of the tree advised the following
cure for the King's illness to her children:—“Anoint
the King's head with ghee and make him lie in the
sun at noon. After that insert a small tube into his
ear, and keep the other end of the tube in a pot full
of water. Then the bugs will come out from the ear
into the water, and the King will be cured of his ill-
ness.
<div n="NI"/>Kīrtisenā, who heard this medical advice from her
seat on top of the tree disguised herself as a physician,
went to the palace and cured the King of his troubles.
In her disguise, she continued to live in the palace as
a friend of the King. Shortly, her husband Devasena,
came there and they were happily reunited. The King
gave them costly presents. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Madana-
mañjukālambaka, Taraṅga 3).
