<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} From Viṣṇu were descended in the
following order—Brahmā—Marīci—Kaśyapa—Vivasvān
-Vaivasvata Manu—Ikṣvāku.
<div n="NI"/>Śraddhā, Vaivasvata Manu's wife bore him ten sons—
Ikṣvāku, Nṛga, Śaryāti, Diṣṭa, Dhṛṣṭa, Karūṣa,
Nariṣyanta, Nābhāga, Pṛṣadhra and Kavi. Vaivasvata
Manu had six more sons by another wife, Chāyā. They
were Manu, Yama, Yamī, Aśvinīkumāra, Revanta,
Sudyumna. The Ikṣvāku family takes its source from
Ikṣvāku. The Kings of the solar dynasty were all born
in the Ikṣvāku family. This dynasty is named “Solar
Dynasty” because Ikṣvāku was born to Vivasvān (Sun)
the son of Kaśyapa. In Devī Bhāgavata, 7th Skandha
we see that Ikṣvāku was born from Manu's spittle. The
descendants of Ikṣvāku up to Śrī Rāmā's sons Lava and
Kuśa are given below:—
