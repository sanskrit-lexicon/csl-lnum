RĀJYAVARDDHANA¦. A king of Vaiśālī. Rājya-
varddhana was a great ascetic, who could comprehend
the past, the present and the future. Knowing that his
death was near, he told his subjects about it and went
into the forests for tapas.
<div n="NI"/>Sorry over the departure of their king, his subjects as
well as ministers began worshipping Sūrya, who appear-
ed and blessed them saying that their king would live
for ten thousand years in perfect health, victory and
with all wealth and prosperity and other resources and
with unimpaired youthfulness.
<div n="NI"/>The ministers and subjects greatly elated over the boon
informed their king in the forest about it, but he only felt
sorry about it. He told them that during his life for ten
thousands years he would have to witness the death of
his sons, grandsons and subjects and would thus have to
be sad throughout life.
<div n="NI"/>The king consoled and made them return. Then he
did rigorous tapas to Sūrya and secured from him the
boon that during his life-time none would die. (Mār-
kaṇḍeya Purāṇa).
