ŚUKA I¦. (ŚUKADEVA). The son of Vyāsa.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} The sage Vyāsa once wished to have a son.
So he began to worship Śiva for the purpose. His
desire was to have a son who would combine in him
the essential qualities of fire, earth, water, air and ether
He did tapas for a hundred years. Because of the
austerity of his tapas, his locks of hair began to blaze
like flames of fire. At last Śiva appeared and blessed
him to have a son according to his wish.
<div n="NI"/>After receiving his boon, Vyāsa returned to his āśrama.
Soon after his arrival there, an Apsaras named Ghṛtācī
came there in the form of a parrot. On seeing her
beauty Vyāsa had an involuntary emission of semen.
Śuka's birth was from this semen. (For further details
see Para 2, under Ghṛtācī).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Śuka's Boyhood.%} It was Śiva who performed the
Upanayana (wearing the sacred thread) ceremony of
Śuka. Since he was born out of the semen which was
the result of the fascination for a parrot, the boy was
named “Śuka”. He was a divine boy. Soon after his
birth, he grew up into an exceptionally brilliant boy.
He went to Bṛhaspati and mastered all knowledge.
After staying with Bṛhaspati for some years, he re-
turned to his father's āśrama.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%In Vyāsa's hut.%} Vyāsa was very happy at the arrival
of his son after completing his education. In due course
he thought of getting his son married to a suitable girl
and to prepare him for an ideal Grhasthāśrama. But
Śuka did not fall in with his father's proposal. All the
efforts of Vyāsa to persuade him were in vain. At last
he told Śuka that he was pleased with his stern resolve
and allowed him to pursue his life as a Sannyāsī, if he
wished for it.
<div n="NI"/>From that time Śukadeva and Sūta, the disciple of
Vyāsa began the study of Bhāgavata. But Śuka did
[Page757-b+ 64]
not find happiness in that study either. Vyāsa taught
him spiritual philosophy. Even then Śuka could not
find mental satisfaction. So his father sent him to
Mithilā. At that time there was none who equalled
Janaka, the then King of Mithilā. Before sending him
away, Vyāsa made his son promise that he would
return to his āśrama, immediately after leaving
Mithilā.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Śuka in Mithilā.%} Śuka started his journey to
Mithilā on foot. He passed through many lands and
cities on his way. He visited many places inhabited by
different classes of people like yogins, sages, mendicants,
Vaikhānasas, Śāktas, Pāśupatas, Sauras, Śaivas,
Vaiṣṇavas, etc. After taking two years to cross Mahā-
meru and one year for crossing Himālaya he reached
Mithilā. At the very sight of the land of Mithilā with
its inhabitants living in luxury and prosperity, Śuka-
deva was filled with wonder.
<div n="NI"/>One of the sentries at the palace gate who saw the
dignified bearing and majestic figure of Śuka, standing
at the entrance, greeted him with joined palms and
conducted him into the royal palace. From there, a
minister took him to the interior of the palace, where
a passage led him to a beautiful park full of flowering
trees and swimming pools. After giving him a seat in
the park the minister left the place. There, he was
attended by women who were like celestial beauties.
But Śuka was not happy even in their company or
attentions. He spent the whole night in deep meditation.
The next morning King Janaka visited Śuka. After the
exchange of customary greetings, Janaka enquired of
him the object of his visit. Śuka answered that he came
there to learn from Janaka the way to salvation, as
directed by his father.
<div n="NI"/>On hearing this, Janaka said:—“After Upanayana,
(investiture with the sacred thread) a Brāhmaṇa
should study the Vedas. He should discharge his debts
to the Devas and to his Pitṛs by tapas, worship of the
guru and Brahmacarya. After the study of the Vedas,
after mastering the senses, he should give Gurudakṣiṇā
(fee to the teacher). Then the pupil may return home
with the permission of the Guru (preceptor). After
reaching home he should begin gṛhasthāśrama. After
the birth of children, he should follow Vānaprasth-
āśrama. In that āśrama, a Brāhmaṇa should kindle
fire in his soul. He should then renounce the dual state,
rise above all desire and remain in Brahmāśrama.”
<div n="NI"/>After receiving Janaka's advice, Śuka returned to his
father.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Domestic Life.%} Śukadeva married the beautiful
Pīvarī, daughter of the Pitṛs and thus began his
gṛhasthāśrama in Vyāsa's āśrama. He had four sons
named Kṛṣṇa, Gauraprabha, Bhūri and Devaśruta and
a daughter named Kīrti, by Pīvarī. Kīrti was married
by Aṇu, the son of King Vibhrāja. (Devī Bhāgavata,
1st Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Vyāsa composed Bhārata and taught it to Śuka.
(M.B. Chapter 1, Verse 104).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Śukadeva recited the Mahābhārata story contain-
ing 14 lakhs of stanzas to Gandharvas, Yakṣas and
Rākṣasas. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 1, Verse 106;
Svargārohaṇa Parva, Chapter 5, Verse 55).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Śukadeva taught them the entire Vedas and the
[Page758-a+ 64]
Mahābhārata story. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 63,
Verse 89).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Śuka attended Yudhiṣṭhira's assembly. (M.B.
Sabhā Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 11).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%The End.%} While Śukadeva was thus leading his family
life, teaching the Vedas and reading the Purāṇas,
Nārada happened to pay a visit to him. His conversa-
tion with Nārada drew Śukadeva nearer to the path of
Mokṣa. He left his father, Veda Vyāsa and his own
family, went to the peak of Kailāsa and stayed there
doing tapas to Paramaśiva. At last he became a per-
fect Siddha and rising up to the Heavens shone there
as a second sun. Devarṣis began to praise Śukadeva.
<div n="NI"/>His father Vyāsa was in deep grief at his disappearance
and left his āśrama in search of Śuka. After wandering
in many places he came to Kailāsa where Śuka had per-
formed tapas and called him. Śiva who saw him utterly
tired and weak took pity on him and comforted him in
the following words: “Did you not pray to me for a
son who would combine in himself the essences of the
Pañcabhūtas? As a result of the tapas you have done
and by my blessing, such a glorious son was born to
you. Śuka has attained the highest position which is
inaccessible to those who have not conquered their
senses and difficult to attain even by the gods. Why do
you worry about Śuka? The glory acquired by your
eminent son will continue undiminished as long as the
mountains and oceans exist. I give you my blessing
that an image exactly like your son will always accom-
pany you from today.” Just then, an image which
closely resembled his son appeared before Vyāsa who
was filled with rapture.
<div n="NI"/>It is believed that even today if any one calls Śiva at
the place where Śiva spoke to Vyāsa in answer to his
call, Śiva would respond to the call. (M.B. Śānti
Parva, Chapters 332 and 333; Devī Bhāgavata, 1st
Skandha).
