BṚHADRATHA I¦. A king. He went to the forest to
lead a life of retirement after having installed his eldest
son on the throne. He began to do penance in the
forest for the attainment of heaven. One day the hermit
Śākāyanya appeared before him and told him that he
might ask any boon. Accordingly the king said, “Tell
me, what eternal Truth is and give me Spiritual know-
ledge”. The hermit complied with his request. (Maitrī
Upaniṣad).
