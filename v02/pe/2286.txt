ELĀPUTRA¦. A serpent born to Kaśyapa of his wife
Kadrū. This serpent was very intelligent. Once there
arose a dispute between Vinatā and Kadrū over the
colour of the tail of the horse of Indra, Uccaiḥśravas.
Kadrū argued that there were black hairs in the tail
while Vinatā held there were none. Really there were
no black hairs and Kadrū to win the argument wanted
her sons to go and hang on the hairs to create a black
colour. The serpents like Vāsuki and others refused to
do so and Kadrū then cursed them saying that they
would all be burnt to death at the Sarpasatra of
Janamejaya. To take measures to get free from this
curse a meeting of the serpents under the leadership of
Śeṣa and Vāsuki was held and in that assembly Elā-
putra made a stirring speech. (Chapter 38, Ādi Parva,
M.B.).
