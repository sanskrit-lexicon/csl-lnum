<div n="NI"/>2) {%Marriage and family life.%} The Bhāgavata states that
Dharma married the thirteen daughters of Daksaprajā-
pati named Śraddhā, Maitrī, Dayā, Śānti, Puṣṭi, Tuṣṭi,
Kriyā, Unnati, Buddhi, Medhā, Titikṣā, Hṛī and Mūrti.
Besides them he married ten other girls named Bhānu,
Lambā, Kukubh, Jāmi, Viśvā, Sādhyā, Marutvatī,
Vasu, Muhūrtā and Saṅkalpā and also a woman named
Sunṛtā. According to Mahābhārata Dharma married
the following daughters of Dakṣa: Kīrti, Lakṣmī, Dhṛti,
Medhā, Puṣṭi, Śraddhā, Kriyā, Buddhi and Lajjā.
<div n="NI"/>From each of his wives there originated a family. The
son born to each is given below Śraddhā—Śubha;
Maitrī—Prasāda; Dayā—Abhaya; Śānti—Sukha; Tuṣṭi—
Moda; Unnati—Darpa; Buddhi—Artha; Medhā—
Sukṛti; Titikṣā—Śama; Hrī—Praśraya. Mūrti gave
birth to the virtuous Naranārāyaṇas. Sunṛtā became the
mother of the devas, Satyavrata and Satyasena.
Satyasena became famous by slaying many cruel and
evil-natured Yakṣas, demons and spirits. Lambā gave
birth to Ṛṣabha and Vidyotana. Ṛṣabha got a son,
Indrasena. Vidyotana became the father of stanayitnu.
Kukubh delivered Saṅkaṭa and Saṅkaṭa became the
father of Kīkaṭa and Durgadeva. Jāmi got a son Svarga
and of him was born Nandī. Viśvā gave birth to Viśva-
[Page224-b+ 60]
devas and Sādhyā to Sādhyas. These Sādhyas are different
from those born of Brahmā. Sādhyas became the father of
Arthasiddhi. Marutvatī gave birth to Marutvat and
Jayanta. Vasu gave birth to eight sons and they were
known as Aṣṭavasus. Droṇa, the first of the Aṣṭavasus,
married Abhimati. Abhimati is known as Dharā also.
It was Droṇa and Dharā who were born as Nandagopa
and Yaśodā later. Prāṇa, second of the Aṣṭavasus,
married Ūrjasvatī, daughter of Priyavrata. (Navama
Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Prominent sons.%} Four sons of Dharma, Hari, Kṛṣṇa,
Nara and Nārāyaṇa became prominent. Hari and
Kṛṣṇa were great yogis while Nara and Nārāyaṇa were
great ascetics. (See under Naranārāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The daughter named Dharmavratā.%} Dharmadeva got a
daughter named Dharmavratā of his wife Dharmavatī.
Dharmavratā was an ascetic and she was married to
Marīci, son of Brahmā. One day Marīci came back
from the forest after getting darbha and flowers extre-
mely tired and so after food lay down to rest. His wife
sitting by his side massaged his legs. The sage fell as-
leep. Then Brahmā came there and Dharmavratā
attended on him and worshipped him. Marīci, when he
woke up, finding Dharmavratā attending on another
man cursed her and made her into stone. Dharmavratā
pleaded not guilty and standing inside a fire-pit did pen-
ance for ten thousand years. Brahmā and other devas
appeared before her and consoled her by assuring that
though she would be a stone devas would take their
abode in it and that she would be worshipped by all.
From that day onwards that stone was known as Devaśilā
and even now it is believed that Brahmā and other
devas live therein. (Chapter 114, Agni Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Dharma was cursed and made Vidura by Aṇimāṇḍavya.%} (See
Aṇimāṇḍavyā).
<div n="NI"/>{%Other details.%} (1) A portion of Dharma took life as Yudhi-
ṣṭhira in Kuntī. (See Dharmaputra).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Dharma did penance in Dharmatīrtha for a very
long time. (Śloka 1, Chapter 84, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(3) The abode of Dharma was Dharmaprastha. (Śloka 1,
Chapter 84, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(4) Dharma did penance on the banks of the river
Vaitaraṇī for a long time. (Śloka 4, Chapter 114, Vana
Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(5) While the Pānḍavas were in exile in the forest
Dharma in the form of a deer came to the hut of a
Brahmin and carried away by its horns the Araṇi stick
which the Brahmin owned for making fire by attrition.
(Chapter 311, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(6) Dharma appeared in the form of a Yakṣa and made
all the Pāṇḍavas swoon except Yudhiṣṭhira, on the
shores of a pond in the forest and later got them back
to normal. (See under Dharmaputra).
<div n="NI"/>(7) Dharmadeva went to Viśvāmitra in the guise of
Vasiṣṭha to test him. (See para 3 of Gālava).
<div n="NI"/>(8) Following a directive from Brahmā, Dharmadeva
once brought before Varuṇa all the daityadānavas bound
by ropes. (Chapter 128, Udyoga Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(9) Mahāviṣṇu was born as a son of Dharmadeva. (See
under Naranārāyaṇa).
[Page225-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(10) Dharma worshipped a brahmin named Satya tak-
ing the form of a deer. (Śloka 17, Chapter 272, Śānti
Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(11) Dharma tested Sudarśana taking the form of a
brahmin. (Śloka 79, Chapter 2, Anuśāsana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(12) Dharma saved a sage named Vatsanābha from a
great downpour taking the shape of a buffalo. (Chapter
12, Anuśāsana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(13) Dharma disguised as a brahmin, went and impart-
ed advice to Janaka, father of Sītā. (Chapter 32, Aśva-
medha Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(14) To test Jamadagni, Dharma went to his āśrama
taking the form of Anger. Jamadagni had just milked
Kāmadhenu and kept the milk in a pot. Dharma as
Anger crept into the milk. Jamadagni drank it and yet
remained calm. Seeing this Dharma appeared before
him in the form of a Brahmin and blessed him assuring
Jamadagni that in future he would be obedient to
Dharma (Chapter 91, Aśvamedha Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(15) When at the fag end of their life the Pāṇḍavas
started on their Mahāprasthāna, Dharma as a dog
accompanied them up to the gates of heaven. (Śloka
22, Chapter 5, Svargārohaṇa Parva).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Dharma and Kāla.%} There is a misunderstanding found
even in some Purāṇas that Kāla, the chief of Kālapurī,
and Dharma are one and the same person. But if the
stories around each are examined it is easy to deduce
that they are two different devas. The father and
mother of Dharmadeva is Brahmā. The father of Kāla
is Sūrya and mother Saṃjñā, daughter of Viśvakarmā.
This itself is a sufficient evidence to show that the two
are different persons. Further, Kāla or Yama is the
sixth descendant of Viṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>But scholars are misled to think that the two are iden-
tical. There is a reason for it.
<Poem>Dharmarājaḥ Pitṛpatiḥ
Samavarttī Paretarāṭ /
Kṛtānto Yamunābhrātā
Śamano Yamarāḍ Yamaḥ //
Kālo Daṇḍadharaḥ Srāddha-
Devo Vaivasvatontakaḥ. / (Amara).</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>The above are the synonyms of Kāla. Vyāsa has used as
synonyms for Dharmadeva in the Mahābhārata the
words Dharmarāja, Vṛṣa and Yama. Now among the
synonyms for the two there are two words in common—
Dharmarāja and Yama. This has led to this misunder-
standing. Because Kāla weighs the evil and good in
man he got the name Dharmarāja. Dharmadeva got
that name because he is the incarnation of Dharma.
The real name of Kāla is Yama. Dharmadeva got the
name Yama because he possesses ‘Yama’ (control of
the self for moral conduct). Kāla has no sons; Vidura
and Yudhiṣṭhira are the sons of Dharmadeva.
