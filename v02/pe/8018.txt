VARAMAṆI¦. A beetle made of jewel. Brahmā had
given a boon that only he who fought with this jewel-
beetle in his mouth could kill Pātāla Rāvaṇa. This

secret was known only to the giants, such as Rāvaṇa.
and others. This Varamaṇi was kept in an under-
ground cell of a harem near the Kālī temple in the
Pātāla.
<div n="NI"/>The battle between Rāma and Rāvaṇa was going on.
Hanūmān made a fort coiling his tail like a spring and
Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa stayed inside this fort. While they
were sleeping, Pātāla Rāvaṇa made a tunnel under the
earth and carried away Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa. Vibhīṣaṇa
knew this, only next day morning. Instantly he sent
Hanūmān to Pātāla. In accordance with the advice of
Vibhīṣana, Hanūmān went directly to the cell in the
harem, took Varamaṇi and put it in his mouth. Then
he fought with Pātāla Rāvaṇa and defeated him. Thus
with the help of the Varamaṇi Hanūmān rescued Rāma
and Lakṣmaṇa. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa).
