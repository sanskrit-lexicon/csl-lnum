YAKṢA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} A class of Semi-gods. There are chiefly
three classes of inhabitants in Heaven:—Devas, Gaṇa-
devas and Upadevas. Gaṇadevas consist of the 12
Ādityas, 10 Viśvadevas, 8 Vasus, 36 Tuṣitas, 64 Ābhās-
varas, 49 Anilas 220 Mahārājikas, 12 Sādhyas and 11
Rudras.
<div n="NI"/>Among the Upadevas there are 10 subdivisions. They
are, Vidyādharas, Apsaras, Yakṣas, Rākṣasas, Gandhar-
vas, Kinnaras, Piśācas, Guhyakas, Siddhas and Bhūtas.
[Page893-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Origin.%} There are different views relating to the
origin of the Yakṣas. In Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva,
Chapter l we find that the Yakṣas took birth after
Brahmā's birth from “Virāṭ Puruṣa's” aṇḍa. According
to a statement in Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 19, Yakṣas and
Rākṣasas were born from Munī, the grand daughter of
Kaśyapaprajāpati. Thus Yakṣas and Rākṣasas are relat-
ed as brothers. In Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 66,
Verse 7, there is another passage which says that Yakṣas
are the progeny of the sage Pulastya.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Other details.%}
