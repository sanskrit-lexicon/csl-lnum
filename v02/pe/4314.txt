MAṄGALACAṆḌIKĀ¦. A devī. Vedas and Vedavids
alike praise this goddess who is always interested in
granting the requests of her devotees. Because she
showers prosperity on her devotees she became known
as Maṅgalacaṇḍikā. There is another version that she
got the name because she was worshipped by Maṅgala
(Kuja) and because she grants the requests of Maṅgala.
Yet another version is that she got the name because
she was worshipped by the King Maṅgala chief of
the seven islands. Born of the species of Durgādevī she
is very kind and affectionate to her devotees. Parama-
śiva worshipped this Devī before he went to destroy
the demon-trio Tripuras. (9th Skandha, Devī Bhāga-
vata).
