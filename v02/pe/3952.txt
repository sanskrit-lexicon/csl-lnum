LAKṢMAṆA¦. Son born to Daśaratha of Sumitrā.
1) {%Short history.%} Since details about Lakṣmaṇa are
included in the story under ‘Rāma’ only a short
description is given below:
<div n="NI"/>Daśaratha, King of Ayodhyā had three wives,
Kausalyā, Kaikeyī and Sumitrā. To obtain children
Daśaratha performed a sacrifice named Putrakāmeṣṭi
requesting the great sage Ṛṣyaśṛṅga to officiate at the
ceremony. At the close of the ceremony a divine
person rose up from the sacrificial fire with a pot of
pudding and all the three wives became pregnant by
eating the same. Kausalyā gave birth to Śrī Rāma,
Kaikeyī to Bharata and Sumitrā to Lakṣmaṇa and
Śatrughna. Lakṣmaṇa was an incarnation of Ananta
and so Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa had more attachment to
each other.
<div n="NI"/>Viśvāmitra once took Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa to the
forests to give protection to the sages against the
demons who gave them trouble. In the course of that
Viśvāmitra took them to the Svayaṃvara held at the
court of Janaka and Śrī Rāma married Sītā and
Lakṣmaṇa married Ūrmilā.
[Page449-a+ 65]
When the coronation of Śrī Rāma was about to take
place, Kaikeyī demanded of Daśaratha, on the strength
of the two boons granted to her on a previous occasion,
to send Śrī Rāma to the forests for fourteen years and
crown Bharata her son as King. Daśaratha was
compelled to accede to her request and so Śrī Rāma
went to the forests. Sītā and Lakṣmaṇa accompanied
him. Lakṣmaṇa during the fourteen years of their
exile followed his brother Rāma like a shadow.
Lakṣmaṇa cut off the breasts and nose of Śūrpaṇakhā,
the demoness who made amorous overtures to them.
Lakṣmaṇa acted promptly and bravely when the
notorious trio, Khara, Dūṣaṇa and Triśiras attacked
them and he was responsible for the slaughter of the
three. Rāvaṇa, coming to know of that, carried away
Sītā to Laṅkā.
<div n="NI"/>Grief-stricken, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa roamed about in
the forests searching for Sītā. At last they came to
Sugrīva with whom they made an alliance. Rāma and
Lakṣmaṇa got back for Sugrīva his kingdom of
Kiṣkindhā and Sugrīva in return helped Rāma and
Lakṣmaṇa to fight Rāvaṇa. Accompanied by an army
led by Sugrīva Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa went to Laṅkā
and defeating Rāvaṇa took back Sītā to Ayodhyā. Śrī
Rāma was crowned King and Lakṣmaṇa helped his
brother in his duties. When there arose a scandal
about Sītā from the people, Śrī Rāma asked Lakṣmaṇa
to take Sītā away to the forest and leave her there. In
the Aśvamedha conducted by Śrī Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa
led the sacrificial horse and the horse was blocked and
captured by Lava and Kuśa and Lakṣmaṇa fought
against them.
<div n="NI"/>When the purpose of the incarnation of Rāma was
over, god of Death in the garb of a sage approached
Śrī Rāma for a private talk. Rāma and the sage were
closeted in a room and Lakṣmaṇa was asked to keep
watch over the door with instructions not to allow
anybody inside. After some time sage Durvāsas
came there and Lakṣmaṇa entered the room to give
his brother the information of his arrival. Rāma was
angry and abandoned Lakṣmaṇa and, feeling repen-
tant later, Śrī Rāma jumped into the river and drowned
himself before a huge crowd of weeping subjects.
Lakṣmaṇa immediately ended his life by drowning
himself at the same place where his brother did so.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Lakṣmaṇa was born on the day of Āśleṣā
in the lagna of Karkaṭaka. (Śloka 15, Chapter 18,
Bāla Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
