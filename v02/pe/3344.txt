KARKOṬAKA¦. A terrible serpent.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} This serpent was born to Kaśyapa by his
wife Kadrū.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The curse.%} Once Karkoṭaka cheated the sage Nārada.
The angry sage cursed him and said that he would
have to remain without the power of movements in
the forest till Nala came to rescue him. From that day
Karkoṭaka lived in that forest, awaiting the arrival of
Nala.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Nala and Karkoṭaka.%} Once a wild fire spread all
over the forest. Karkoṭaka whose power of movement
was destroyed by Nārada's curse, cried aloud, calling
upon Nala to come and save him. It was at this time
that Nala arrived at the spot after leaving Damayantī
in the forest. Nala came to him, on hearing his cries.
The serpent informed Nala about the story of Nārada's
curse and reducing himself to the size of a thumb sat
on the ground. Nala removed him to a safe spot away
[Page391-a+ 64]
from the fire. The serpent asked Nala to walk a few
steps counting his footsteps. Nala did so and at the
tenth step, Karkoṭaka stung him and his whole body
was turned blue. Suddenly Karkoṭaka assumed his own
original shape and spoke to Nala as follows:—“I have
changed your appearance so that people may not be
able to recognize you. Kali who is troubling you, still
lives within you. It is he who is affected by my
poison. You need not fear danger from poison any
more. You will never be defeated in battle. Go and
engage yourself as the charioteer of Ṛtuparṇa, King of
Ayodhyā. You will teach him Aśvahṛdaya mantra. In
return for it he will teach you Akṣahṛdaya mantra.
Here are two garments which I give you. If you put
them on, you will be restored to your own shape.
May you be blessed again with a happy family life.”
After saying this, Karkoṭaka vanished. (M.B. Vana
Parva, Chapter 66).
