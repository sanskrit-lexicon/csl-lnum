AURVA II¦. A brahmin living in the country of Mālava.
This brahmin got a daughter named Śamīka by his wife
Sumedha. She was married very early to Mandāra, son
of Dhaumyaka and disciple of Śaunaka. After some
days when Mandāra found his wife fully grown he went
to Aurva to bring his wife home. Aurva sent them both
to the house of Mandāra with his blessings. On their
way home they met the Maharṣi Bhuśuṇḍi and burst
into laughter at his sight. The sage cursed them and

made them into two trees. When Aurva found his
daughter and son-in-law missing he started a search for
them. Then he came to know that both of them had
changed into trees by a curse. Aurva and his wife then
prayed to God for help. Aurva then lived in the tree
of Śamā in the shape of Agni and Śaunaka made an
idol of Gaṇapati with the root of the Mandāra tree and
worshipped him. Gaṇapati was pleased by the devotional
deeds of Aurva and Śaunaka and changed the trees
again into Śamīka and Mandāra. (Gaṇeśa Purāṇa).
