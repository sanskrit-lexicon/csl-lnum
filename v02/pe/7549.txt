TĪRTHA¦. A holy place. Even from very ancient times
the people of Bhārata believed in the sacredness of holy
places and they considered a pilgrimage to holy places
as a part and parcel of their life. Almost all the Purāṇas
have praised the greatness of holy places.
<div n="NI"/>It is not true that all those who visit holy places and
bathe in the sacred ponds there would get salvation. In
Chapter 11 of Padma Purāṇa it is stated thus:
<div n="NI"/>He would get salvation whose limbs, mind, knowledge,
austerity and fame are under his own control. He who
lives clean in body, without egoism, contented and never
accepting gifts for services done would get salvation by
visiting holy places. He who would fast if he did not
get food, whose organs of sense are all under control
would get salvation if he visits holy places. He who is
righteous, free from anger, treats all animate objects
like himself would get salvation if he visits holy place.
<div n="NI"/>Once the great sage Cyavana told Prahlāda thus: “Only
those who are pure in heart would get the benefit of
visiting sacred places. It is a sin for others to do pilgrim-
age. The banks of Gaṅgā are crowded with villages
and cities. Many types of people like Parayas, Fisher-
men, Vaṅgas, Khasas, Huns and Mlecchas live there.
They bathe in the holy river and drink the holy water,
but they do not get salvation because their mind and
heart are not clean.” (4th Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
