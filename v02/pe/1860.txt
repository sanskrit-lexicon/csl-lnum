DEVAŚARMĀ VI¦. A Brahmin who lived on the nor-
thern side of river Kāverī. The following story about
him is told in chapters 2, 4 and 12 of the Skanda
Purāṇa.
<div n="NI"/>One day in the month of Kārttika he asked his son to
bathe. The son refused to obey his father, who got
angry at the disobedience of the son and cursed him to be
turned into a rat. But, when the son begged his pardon
he said that the boy would resume his old form when
he heard about the greatness of Kārttika.
<div n="NI"/>While the Brahmin, thus turned into rat, was roaming
about in the forest it saw Viśvāmitra maharṣi seated
under a tree with his disciples. The maharṣi was telling
the disciples about the greatness of Kārttika. The Brah-
min boy—turned cat—heard the story and reverted to
its old form as the Brahmin boy.
