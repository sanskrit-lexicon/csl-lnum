KETAKĪ¦. (A flower). [Pandarnus odoratissimus]
Though Ketakī is a flower which had been worn on
Śiva's head, it is not worshipped for the following
reason.
<div n="NI"/>In Satyayuga Mahāviṣṇu performed intense penance
on the Śveta island for the attainment of eternal happi-
ness. Brahmā also performed penance at a beauti-
ful place for the annihilation of desires. During
their tapas Viṣṇu and Brahmā, for a rest, left their
seats and walked about in the forest when they met
each other. There arose a controversy between them
about their respective greatness when Śiva, in the form
of a Liṅga, appeared between the two contestants and
told them that he, who first found out his (Śiva's) head
or feet was greater than the other. Accordingly Viṣṇu
went down and Brahmā went up on a tour of
enquiry.
<div n="NI"/>Though Viṣṇu went down deeper and deeper for a long
time to find out Śiva's feet he failed in the attempt and so
returned and sat at the place whence he started for the
search. Brahmā went up a very long distance when he
saw a Ketakī flower falling down from the sky. He took
the flower in his hands and went to Viṣṇu and told him
that he had found out Śiva's head and showed the
Ketakī flower as proof of his discovery claiming that it
was taken from Śiva's head. But Viṣṇu did not believe
Brahmā and asked the Ketakī flower to bear witness
to Brahmā's claim. The flower gave false evidence in
favour of Brahmā. Śiva got angry at this false evidence
of Ketakī and cursed it. The Ketakī lost its place
among the best flowers from that day onwards.
