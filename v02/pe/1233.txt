BILVA¦. (VILVA). A devotee of Viṣṇu. There is a
story in Skanda Purāṇa about Bilva who lived as a
Vaiṣṇavite first and then was converted to a Śaivite.
<div n="NI"/>In the beginning Brahmā created many things among
which Vilva (tree) (Crataeva religiosa) also was
created. Under that tree an anonymous man began to
live. Brahmā gave him the name Vilva. Being pleased
at the behaviour and devotion of Bilva, Indra asked him
to turn the wheel of administration of the earth. Accep-
ting the offer Bilva requested Indra to give him the
Vajra (diamond) for the smooth running of the adminis-
tration of the earth. Indra told him that vajrāyudha
(diamond-weapon) would be at his disposal, when he
thought about it, if the occasion required it.
<div n="NI"/>Once Kapila a Śaivite reached the palace of Bilva.
After a long conversation both became fast friends. One
[Page146-a+ 65]
day there was a debate between Bilva and Kapila as to
whether penance or Action (doing one's duty) was
appreciable. In this discussion Bilva lost the equilibrium
of his mind and thinking of the diamond-weapon of
Indra cut off the head of Kapila. In Kapila there was
the power of penance as well as the power of Śiva. So
through Śiva Kapila got immortality. In the meanwhile
Bilva went to Viṣṇu and got a boon that every living
thing in the earth should fear him. But the boon was
futile. This was a turning point for Bilva. The mind of
Bilva changed to devotion for Śiva. He concentrated his
attention on the worship of Śivaliṅga at the forest of
Mahākāla. One day Kapila came by that way and was
greeted by Bilva with honour and regard, and they
again became fast friends.
