DRUPADA¦. (Saumaki,
<F>1. Mahāb hārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 66, Stanza 68 states that the original name of Drupada was Yajñasena. Mahābhārata,

the son of Somaka.</F> Yajñasena). Father of Pāñcālī.

<div n="NI"/>2) {%Education and kingship.%} Yajñasena went to the hermi-
tage of Bharadvāja for education. Droṇa, who became
a great teacher in archery later, was also a student and
disciple of Bharadvāja at that time. Thus during the
time of education both Drupada and Droṇa became
fast friends. After receiving education Drupada re-
turned to his country. At that time Pāñcāla was ruled
by Pṛṣata. When Yajñasena returned on completion of
his education, Pṛṣata died and Yajñasena was anointed
as King of Uttara-Pāñcāla. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chap-
ter 129).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Yajñasena reproaches Droṇa.%} It has already been said
that during the period of education Droṇa and Yajña-
sena were fast friends. Once Drupada said to Droṇa:
“My dear friend. My father has told me that I would
be made the King of Uttara Pāñcāla on completing my
education. Thus if I become a King, the treasury of the
King will be at your disposal.”
<div n="NI"/>After the education both returned to their places. Not
much later Droṇa got married. A son born to him was
named Aśvatthāmā. Droṇa was so poor that he could
not even buy milk for his child. Once the friends of
Aśvatthāmā mixed flour in water and made him drink
it saying that it was milk. Aśvatthāmā drank it without
knowing that it was not milk. Thinking that he had
become energetic by drinking milk he began to run
with the other boys. At last they told him the truth
and teased him.
<div n="NI"/>With his wife and child Droṇa went to Drupada who
did not care to recognize him as a friend. Droṇa tried
to remind him of their former friendship. But Drupada
shunned him and said, “If I had friendship with you,
it was to achieve certain ends. There is no friendship
between the rich and the poor, the learned and the
illiterate, the brave and the coward. So if there was
any friendship at all it was not real. You, who are slow
of brain! Kings of high status cannot have friendship
with such people especially the poor. A Brahmin
learned in Vedas won't befriend a Brahmin who is not
learned in Vedas, a man seated in a chariot cannot
befriend a man who is not seated in a chariot and a
King cannot befriend one who is not a King. So a
friendship of bygone days is no friendship at all”.
<div n="NI"/>Drupada's reproaches aroused a storm of anger in
Droṇa. He vowed that he would avenge the insult.
With his wife and child he got out of the palace. He
[Page252-a+ 65]
wandered about in search of disciples who were capable
of confronting with Drupada. At last he came to
Hastināpura and became the teacher of the Pāṇḍavas
and the Kauravas. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 130).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The revenge of Droṇa.%} Droṇa told Bhīṣma about his
dealings with Drupada. Bhīṣma consoled Droṇa. Before
the commencement of the training in archery, Droṇa
told his disciples: “When your training in archery is
completed you will have to do a favour to your tea-
cher”. All stood agape. But Arjuna came forward and
said: “I will do”. Droṇa embraced Arjuna. The train-
ing commenced. The Andhakas, Vṛṣṇis and others
joined his school of archery.
<div n="NI"/>The training in archery came to an end. Droṇa called
his disciples and told them that Drupada should be
tied with a rope and placed before him. When they
heard the words of the teacher, Duryodhana, Karṇa, Yu-
yutsu, Duśśāsana, Vikarṇa, Jarāsandha and Sulocana led
the Kauravas to Pāñcāla. Arjuna knew that the
Kauravas would not be able to defeat Drupada. He
told the teacher that when the Kauravas returned
without achieving the task, he himself would go and
bring Drupada. After a terrible battle the Kauravas
were defeated by the Pāñcālas. After that Arjuna con-
fronted Drupada. Nakula and Sahadeva stood as
guards of the wheels. Bhīmasena with his club stood
in front of the army. Arjuna drove the chariot right
in the midst of the Pāñcāla army. Bhīma took his club
and a terrible battle ensued. Arjuna shattered the
Pāñcāla army, bound Drupada and took him to Droṇa.
The teacher looked at Drupada and reproached him
with scornful word: “I have destroyed your country.
Now you are at my mercy. Is not the former friendship
a friendship?” Drupada requested that they should be
friends in future. Accordingly Drupada was set free.
The country of Pāñcāla was divided into two, and
giving Uttara Pāñcāla to Drupada, Droṇa took Dakṣiṇa
Pāñcāla. Thus because of the revenge of Droṇa, Dru-
pada lost half of his kingdom. (M.B. Ādi Parva,
Chapter 137).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Birth of Children.%} Though Droṇa and Drupada
were on friendly terms Drupada did not forget the
defeat he had incurred at the hands of Droṇa. So,
Drupada desired to have a son who would become
powerful enough to take revenge on Droṇa. He began
to think of ways and means. He consulted several
learned Brahmins. At that time two hermit brothers
yāja and Upayāja lived on the bank of the Ganges.
The King approached them and requested their help to
obtain a son, who would kill Droṇa, and promised to
give them cows and other precious things in return.
At first they refused to help him. The King served
Upayāja for a year, and pleased him. He sent the King
to the hermitage of Yāja. They accepted the request
of the King. Both the hermits performed a sacrifice
for Drupada. A boy and a girl arose from the sacrifi-
cial fire. The boy was named Dhṛṣṭadyumna and the
girl was named Kṛṣṇā (Pāñcālī). There was a celes-
tial voice that the boy would kill Droṇa when he grew
up. (M.B. Ādi parva, Chapter 167).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%The marriage of Pāñcālī.%} Pāñcālī grew up. Drupada
desired to give her in marriage to Arjuna. But at that
time the lac-house caught fire and the Pāṇḍavas disap-
peared. Drupada set certain tests in the Svayaṃvara
of Pāñcālī with a view to ascertain if Arjuna was alive.
[Page252-b+ 65]
The Pāṇḍavas came to the svayaṃvara and Drupada
found out Arjuna. But Drupada did not like the idea
of his daughter becoming the wife of more than one
husband. Then Vyāsa appeared there and informed
Drupada of the previous births of the Pāṇḍavas and
Pāñcālī. Drupada was much pleased and he gave the
Pāṇḍavas a good deal of wealth and sent Pāñcālī with
them. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 196).
