DEVABHĀGAŚRAUTĀRṢA¦. A ṛṣi, the son of Śruta
and learned in yajñas. He had accurate knowledge as to
[Page208-a+ 64]
which parts of the yajña-cow should be distributed to
whom, and till death he did not impart this knowledge
to anyone. But, sometime afterwards a non-human
individual taught the subject to Girija, son of Babhru.
(Aitareya Brāhmaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>At the time when the Sṛñjayas and the Kuru kings were
living in amity consequent upon the dākṣāyaṇa yajña
it was this Devabhāga who acted as the priest of both
the parties. His theories on Sāvitrāgni are quoted in
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa.
