VṚKA III¦. An asura. This asura wanted to bring the
Devas under his control. “How to achieve it? The only
way is to please one of the three god-heads.” The
asura saw Nārada and asked him which of the three
god-heads could easily be pleased. Nārada replied
that it was Śiva. Vṛka resolved to please Śiva and be-
gan to do penance. He cut each of his organs and offer-
ed it in the fire as oblation. At last when Vṛkāsura
was beginning to cut his head to offer it in fire, Śiva
made his appearance, and asked him what his wish
was. The boon he requested for, was that any one whose
head he touched with his finger should die instantly.
Śiva granted that boon.
<div n="NI"/>The asura decided to try the boon, on the giver himself
first. Terrified at this, Śiva began to run. The asura
chased him. At last Śiva sought protection from Viṣṇu.
Assuming the form of a boy, Mahāviṣṇu stood on the
way and stopped Vṛkāsura, who was running after Śiva.
The boy asked him why he was running. The asura
told the boy everything. Then the boy laughed and
said “Oh! Asura! What Śiva said was a lie. He has no
divine power now. He was making fun of you. Not an
ant would die by the touch of your fingers. You just try
on your head and see for yourself.” Hearing this the
asura became dejected. He thought what the boy said
was true. The poor creature touched his own head with
his finger. The moment he touched his head, he fell
down dead. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 10). This story has
similarity with that of Bhasmāsura. (See under
Bhasmāsura).
