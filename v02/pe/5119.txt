sūya conducted by Dharmaputra. During the big battle
the Pauṇḍras fought against the Kauravas constructing
a Krauñcavyūha (a battle array in the shape of a
stork). (Chapter 50, Bhīṣma Parva). Kṛṣṇa and Karṇa
on two different occasions conquered this country.
(Śānti Parva, M.B.) The Pauṇḍras were Kṣatriyas
once. But the brahmins cursed them and changed them
into Śūdras. (Chapter 85, Anuśāsana Parva).
