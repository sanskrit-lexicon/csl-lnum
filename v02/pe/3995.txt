LĪLĀVATĪ II¦. A prostitute who attained Svarga by
simply observing the Śuklāṣṭamīvrata in the month of
Proṣṭhapada in which was born Rādhādevī. Chapter
seven, Brahmakhaṇḍa of Padma Purāṇa contains the
following story.
<div n="NI"/>In times of old in Kṛtayuga there was a beautiful
prostitute of the name Līlāvatī. Once she went away
from her own town to another in search of better pros-
pects. There she saw a big assemblage of people in a
temple. They were observing Rādhāṣṭamīvrata and
worshipping their deity with scented flowers and incense
of sweet fragrance. Some were reciting prayers, some
were singing and yet others were dancing. The whole
atmosphere was filled with devotion. Līlāvatī went to
them and enquired about it. They told her that that
day was the birthday of Rādhādevī, the Śuklāṣṭamī of
the month of Proṣṭhapada, and if anyone observed
Vrata on that day worshipping Rādhādevī he would be
absolved of all sins.
<div n="NI"/>On hearing that, Līlāvati decided to observe the Vrata.
She joined the devotees of the temple and observed the
Vrata with great devotion. Soon she died of snake-bite
and the servants of Yama came to take her soul to hell
because of the sins she had committed as a prostitute.
But before the Yamadūtas could touch her, Pārṣadas
of Mahāviṣṇu wearing the insignia of Śaṅkha, Cakra,
Gadā and Padma came to her with a chariot drawn
by kingly swans and took her to heaven.
