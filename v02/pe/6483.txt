SATYAVATĪ I¦. The mother of Vyāsa.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%A short history.%} Satyavatī was the daughter of the
celestial maid Adrikā. Because of a curse she lived as
a fish in the river Ganges. Once the semen of King
Uparicaravasu happened to fall in the Ganges and
this fish swallowed it in consequence of which it became
pregnant. A fisherman caught this fish and cut it. He
got two human babies, male and female from the
stomach of the fish. The fisherman gave the two
infants to the King who took the male child. This
child later became the Matsya King. The female child
had the smell of fish. The King called her Matsya-
Gandhī (She who has the smell of fish) and gave her
back to the fisherman, who took the child to his hut
and brought her up as his daughter. As the child was
dark in complexion the fisherman called her Kālī. Thus
the girl was known by two names Kālī and Matsya-
gandhī. Later she got the name Satyavatī also.
<div n="NI"/>The fisherman was engaged in the work of ferrying
people across the river. Matsyagandhī helped her
father in this work. She became a full-bloomed young
woman. One day the hermit Parāśara came by that
way and when he saw Matsyagandhī, he fell in love
with her. She ferried the hermit across the river. In
the middle of the river Parāśara created an artificial fog
inside which Parāśara took Matsyagandhī as his wife.
From that moment Matsyagandhī became Kastūrī-
gandhī (she who has the smell of Kastūrī (musk).
Kālī became pregnant and delivered instantly. Parā-
śara, left the place after having blessed her that she
would not lose her virginity.
<div n="NI"/>The son born to Kālī, immediately grew up to be a
youth. After promising his mother that he would
come to her when she thought of him, the youth went
to the forest for penance. The name of the son was
Kṛṣṇa. This Kṛṣṇa later became famous by the name
Vyāsa. Satyavatī again engaged herself in helping her
father.
<div n="NI"/>One day Śantanu, a King of the lunar dynasty came to
the forest for hunting. The fragrance of musk emanat-
ing from the body of Kastūrīgandhī spread throughout
the whole forest. The King walked on through the
forest tracing the origin of the smell of musk and
reached the fisherman's hut. The King fell in love with
Satyavatī. The King had a son named Bhīṣma by his
first wife Gaṅgā. Bhīṣma made it easy for the King to
[Page709-b+ 65]
marry Satyavatī. Two sons Citrāṅgada and Vicitra-
vīrya were born to Śantanu by his wife Satyavatī.
Citrāṅgada was killed in his boyhood. Vicitravīrya
became a youth and married Ambikā and Ambālikā
the daughters of the King of Kāśī. Vicitravīrya met
with untimely death before a child was born to him.
When Satyavatī saw that the family was about to
become extinct, she thought of her son Vyāsa, who
instantly arrived at the palace. From Vyāsa, Ambālikā
got the son Pāṇḍu and Ambikā, the son Dhṛtarāṣṭra.
Both the sons Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Pāṇḍu got married.
Pāṇḍu died. The death of her son struck heavily at
the heart of Satyavatī. She did not wish to live much
longer after this. She mentioned about the fearful
things yet to happen. Then taking her daughters-in-
law Ambikā and Ambālikā with her, Satyavatī went to
the forest to do penance and finally attained heaven.
