<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Bṛhaspati once approached, on the crest of
a wave of lust, Mamatā, his brother's wife who was
pregnant then. The child from the mother's womb said
‘no’ to the move. But, Bṛhaspati cursed the child and
had his own way with Mamatā. Thus two children
developed in her womb. Just after delivering the child-
ren the mother went away leaving the child by Bṛhas-
pati behind. The Devas took charge of the forsaken
child and named him Bharadvāja. Ultimately they
handed over the child (Bharadvāja) to king Bharata,
the famous son of Duṣyanta. Children had already been
born to Bharata by his three wives, but as all of them
were found to be immoral the mothers themselves killed
them. It was at such a juncture that Bharata got Bha-
radvāja as adopted son. (Bharadvāja is known by
another name also, Vitatha). From Vitatha was born
Manyu, from Manyu Bṛhatkṣetra from Bṛhatkṣetra
Jaya and from Jaya Garga. The famous Rantideva
was the grandson of Nara. (the brother of Garga) and
son of Saṃkṛti. A son called Śani was born to Garga
after which he took to Sannyāsa. (Bhāgavata, Daśama
Skandha, Chapters 20 and 21).

kunda, while asleep once in a cave had a sight of Kṛṣṇa.
