NALA I¦. Nala the King of Niṣadha. (As the history of
Nala is included under the word Damayantī, some
points which are not given there, are mentioned here).
<div n="NI"/>(i) Nala was the son of Vīrasena, the King of Niṣadha.
(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 52, Stanza 56).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Once the hermit Bṛhadaśva came to the Palace of
Vīrasena and praised Nala a good deal and spoke
highly of his good qualities to his father. (M.B. Vana
Parva, Chapter 53, Stanza 2).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) When Nala was playing in the garden some swans
with golden wings flew to the lake in the garden. Nala
caught hold of one of them just for fun. The swan said
to Nala, “If you will let me off, I will tell Damayantī
about you.” So it was released. As a reward it flew to
[Page519-b+ 65]
the country of Vidarbha and persuaded Damayantī to
love Nala. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 53).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) After death Nala sat in the aerial chariot of Indra
and witnessed the battle fought by Arjuna with the
Kauravas at the end of the forest life of the Pāṇḍavas.
(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 56, Stanza 10).
<div n="NI"/>(v) Previous birth. Two different stories are narrated
about the previous birth of Nala.
<div n="NI"/>1) In the previous birth Nala was a Vaiśya of the
city of Pippala in the Gauḍa country. This Vaiśya
became abstinent and after leaving off everything he
had, he went to the forest. There, according to the
advice of a hermit he undertook the fast of Gaṇeśa.
As a result he was born as Nala in the next birth.
(Gaṇeśa Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) Nala and Damayantī were foresters named Āhuka
and Āhukā. Śiva was pleased with the couple. So they
were born in royal families in the next birth, and Śiva
in the form of a swan, helped them. (Śiva Purāṇa,
Śatarudra Saṃhitā).
