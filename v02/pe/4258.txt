MALLARĀṢṬRA¦. A country in ancient India. The
capital of Mallarāṣṭra was the present city of Kuśī. At
the time of Mahābhārata, this country was ruled by a
King named Pārthiva. There is a statement in the
Mahābhārata that this King was defeated by Bhīmasena.
When the Pāṇḍavas discussed the countries in which
they were to live “incognito”, the name of Mallarāṣṭra
was also mentioned. (Mahābhārata, Sabhā Parva,
Chapter 30, Verse 3; Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 9, Verse
44; Virāṭa Parva, Chapter 1, Verse 13).
