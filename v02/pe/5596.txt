RAIBHYA I¦. A hermit who was famous in the Palace of
Yudhiṣṭhira. Information about this hermit, found in
the Mahābhārata is given below:
<div n="NI"/>(1) Raibhya who was a friend of Bharadvāja had two
sons named Arvāvasu and Parāvasu. They were
great scholars. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 135,
Stanza 12).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Bharadvāja once forbade his son Yavakrīta from
going to the hermitage of Raibhya. Getting angry at
this, Raibhya struck his matted hair on the ground and
created a wicked fairy and ordered her to kill Yavakrīta.
Knowing this Bharadvāja ran to that place and cursed
Raibhya that his eldest son would kill him.
<div n="NI"/>Once Parāvasu, mistaking his father for a cruel animal
killed him. By the effort of his second son Arvāvasu,
Raibhya was brought to life again. (M.B. Vana Parva,
