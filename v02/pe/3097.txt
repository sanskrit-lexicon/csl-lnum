KĀLAKĀ¦ (KĀLIKĀ). One of the daughters of Dakṣa.
Kaśyapa married her. Mahābhārata, Vana Parva,
Chapter 183 states that Kālakeya and Narakāsura were
born to Kālakā by Kaśyapa. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
Araṇya Kāṇḍa, Chapter 14). In Mahābhārata Araṇya
Parva, Chapter 174 we find that Kālakā once received
from Brahmā, a boon that her sons would never be
killed.
