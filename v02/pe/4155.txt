MAHĀŚAṄKHA I¦. A crocodile celebrated in the
Purāṇas. He had a wife named Śaṅkhinī. The seven
children born to Śaṅkhinī became the Maruts in the
Svārociṣa Manvantara. There is a story in Chapter 72,
Vāmana Purāṇa about these children who became
Maruts.
<div n="NI"/>Ṛtadhvaja, son of Svārociṣa Manu had seven heroic
sons. They went to Mahāmeru and began to worship
Brahmā for gaining Indra's place. Indra was alarmed.
He sent the Apsarā woman Pūtanā to the sons of Ṛta-
dhvaja to obstruct their tapas. There was a river flowing
by the side of their āśrama. Ṛtadhvaja's sons came to
the river to take their bath. Just at that time, Pūtanā
also came there and began to take bath. At her sight,
the young men had an involuntary emission of semen.
Śaṅkhinī, wife of the crocodile Mahāśaṅkha swallowed
it. The princes whose tapas was interrupted returned
to the palace. Pūtanā returned to Indra and reported
the matter.
<div n="NI"/>After some years, Śaṅkhinī happened to be caught in
a fisherman's net. The fisherman caught her and inform-
ed Ṛtadhvaja's sons about his catch. They took her to
the palace and put her in a tank there. In due course
Śaṅkhinī gave birth to seven children. Immediately
after that she attained mokṣa. The children began to cry
for mother's milk, moving about in the water. Then
Brahmā appeared to them and told them not to cry
and assured them that they would become the Devas of
“Vāyu Skandha”. He took them up to the sky and put
them in Vāyuskandha. These children were the Maruts
of the Svārociṣa Manvantara.
