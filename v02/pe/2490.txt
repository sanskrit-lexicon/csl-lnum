GOTAMA¦. A sage named Gotama, son of Rahūgaṇa,
is found everywhere in Ṛgveda. The seventy-fourth
sūkta in the thirteenth anuvāka of the first maṇḍala of
Ṛgveda is composed by this sage. There are many other
sūktas also in his name. This sage is not the Gautama,
husband of Ahalyā, who made Sūkta 58, Anuvaka 11,
Maṇḍala 1 of Ṛgveda.
<div n="NI"/>Once this Gotama tired of thirst asked the Maruts for
some water. The Maruts took a huge well to his side
and poured water into a big pot. (Sūktas 86, 87,
Anuvāka 14, Maṇḍala 1, Ṛgveda).
<div n="NI"/>It was Aśvinīdevas who took the well to Gotama.
(Sūkta 116, Anuvaka 17, Maṇḍala 1, Ṛgveda).
