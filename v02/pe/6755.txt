SṚÑJAYA I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} See under Somadatta.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%General information.%} A king of the Ikṣvāku dynasty.
His father was Śviti. This king Śviti was also called
Śvitya King. On the death of his father Sṛñjaya became
king.
<div n="NI"/>The hermits Nārada and Parvata were friends of Sṛñ-
jaya. Once both of them came and lived in the palace
of the King as his guests. Sṛñjaya had a beautiful
daughter named Śucismitā. Both Nārada and Par-
vata loved her. One day Nārada directly asked Sṛñ-
[Page738-b+ 64]
jaya, for the hand of his daughter. Parvata got angry
at this and cursed Nārada that he would not attain
heaven. Nārada retorted with the same curse. Sṛñjaya
pacified both.
<div n="NI"/>Sṛñjaya had no sons. He informed the hermits of this
sad state. Nārada blessed the king and said that a son
named Suvarṇaṣṭhīvī would be born to him and that
with his birth everything in the palace would become
gold. Accordingly the son Suvarṇaṣṭhīvī was born to
Sṛñjaya and everything in the palace became golden.
When the son became four years old, by the sorcery of
Indra the child died. Nārada brought him to life again.
(See under Suvarṇaṣṭhīvī).
<div n="NI"/>The fact that gold was accumulating in the palace of
Sṛñjaya due to the boon given to Suvarṇaṣṭhīvī, reached
the ears of robbers. One night they carried the child
away, and killed him. Then only did they come to
understand that there was no gold inside him. Sṛñjaya
cried aloud at the loss of his son. To pacify the King,
Nārada and Parvata told him stories of sixteen kings.
