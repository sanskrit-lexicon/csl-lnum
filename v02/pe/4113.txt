MAHĀKADAMBA¦. A tree standing on the tall peak
of Supārśva mountain. The Purāṇas declare that five
big rivers take their sources from the hollow trunk of
this big tree. These rivers fall on the top of Supārśva
mountain and flow through the western side of Ilāvṛta.
The region around this place to a distance of a hundred
yojanas is filled with the fragrant air breathed out by
the gods who feed upon the essence of the waters in
these rivers. The Devī who lives in this sacred place
is called “Dhāreśvarī”. (Devī Bhāgavata, 8th
Skandha).
