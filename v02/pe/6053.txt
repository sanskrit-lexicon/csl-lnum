ŚAMBHU IV¦. A Rākṣasa, the son of Vidyujjihva by
Śūrpaṇakhā. Śambhu, who was engaged in tapas in
Daṇḍaka forest when Śrī Rāma visited the forest was
attracted by the beauty of Sītā and transformed himself
into a tree to enjoy her beauty with his eyes. Lakṣmaṇa,
who was felling down trees to build an āśrama felled
this tree also, which disappeared immediately leaving
behind the dead body of a Rākṣasa. It was the corpse
of the Rākṣasa and Rāma comforted Sītā and Lakṣmaṇa
by revealing the fact to them. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa.
Araṇyakāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>Uttara Rāmāyaṇa contains a story of how Devavatī
(or Vedavatī) daughter of Kuśadhvaja once cursed
Śambhu. Devavatī was born from the mouth of
Kuśadhvaja (son of Bṛhaspati) while he was learning
the Vedas. Śambhu wanted to marry the child when
she was grown up, but Kuśadhvaja did not consent to
it, and Śambhu, in retaliation, killed Kuśadhvaja in
his sleep. Next morning Devavatī awoke from sleep to
see the dead body of her father. She cursed Śambhu.
Her curse was a contributory cause for the death of
Śambhu by Lakṣmaṇa.
