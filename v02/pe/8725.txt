YAMUNĀ¦. Another name for the river Kālindī. (See
also under Kālindī).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%How the water in Kālindī turned Black:%}-The water in
the river Kālindi is black in colour. There is a story
behind the changing of the colour of this river-water
into black. Originally it was clear.
<div n="NI"/>After the death of Satī, Dakṣa's daughter, Śiva broke
up Dakṣa yāga and went about rambling round the
world. Kāmadeva who saw Śiva who had lost his wife
(Satī) shot him with “Unmādāstra” (an arrow causing
madness and excitement). Śiva, in his excitement,
always thinking about Satī, wandered about, finding
peace and rest nowhere. In his excited and restless
state he plunged himself into Kālindī river. Just then,
the clear water of the river turned black. (Vāmana
Purāṇa, Chapter 6).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The greatness of Kālindī (Yamunā).%} The Purāṇas
declare that by bathing in the holy Kālindī one attains
heaven. There is a story illustrating this in Padma
Purāṇa, Chapter 30, as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Long ago, in Kṛtayuga, there lived in the country of
[Page894-b+ 65]
Niṣadha, a very wealthy Vaiśya, by name Hemakuṇ-
ḍala. By doing various kinds of business, he had earned
eight crores of golden coins. By that time he was advanc-
ing in age. At this stage he began to think of the transi-
toriness of worldly pleasures and set apart one-sixth of
his entire wealth for charitable purposes. He built two
temples—one for Viṣṇu and the other for Śiva. He
offered daily worship to the gods and spent money in
generous hospitality. His two sons, Śrīkuṇḍala and
Vikuṇḍala were growing up. He entrusted the burden
of domestic affairs to them and went to the forest to
perform austere tapas, after which he attained Viṣṇu-
loka.
<div n="NI"/>His sons, who were intoxicated with their affluent and
luxurious life, deviated from the path of virtue and
began to indulge in all kinds of sensual pleasures. It
did not take long for them to be reduced to utter
poverty. Their relatives and dependants left them to
their fate and at last, they began to resort to stealing.
For fear of the King, the public and the law, they
changed their residence to the woods. One of them
went to a mountain and the other to a forest. One day,
the elder brother was caught by a tiger and the younger
was bit by a snake. Both of them died on the same day.
Yama's agents took both to Yamaloka. Dharmarāja
(Yama) ordered the elder brother to be sent to Naraka
(Hell) and the younger one (Vikuṇḍala) to be sent to
Heaven.
<div n="NI"/>Vikuṇḍala who knew that he did not deserve Heaven
by any standards, asked Yama's agent how this had
happened. The agent gave him this answer:—“There
was a Brāhmaṇa well-versed in Vedic lore, who was the
son of Harimitra. His āśrama was on the southern bank
of Yamunā. While you were living in the forest, you were
associated with him. As a result of that contact, it so
happened that you bathed for two months in the holy
river Kālindī, the waters of which have the power of
absolving sinners. By your bath in the first month
you were liberated from all sins. By the second you
have become eligible for Heaven. You have qualified
yourself for the eternal bliss of Heaven, by that holy
act.”
<div n="NI"/>Yamunā is being worshipped as a goddess. Devotees of
this goddess imagine her as riding on a tortoise, carry-
ing a water pot in her hand and is of black complexion.
(Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 50).
