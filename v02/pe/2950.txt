JAYADRATHA I¦. A mighty warrior King who ruled over
the kingdom of Sindhu.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu in the following
order: Brahmā—Atri—Candra—Budha—Purūravas-
Āyus—Nahuṣa—Yayāti—Pūru—Janamejaya—Prācin-

<F>1. It is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 67 that Jayadratha was the son of Bṛhatkṣatra. After Bharata, Bṛhat-
kṣatra was the only famous and mighty emperor. Really speaking Jayadratha was the grandson of Bṛhatkṣatra. The statement that Jayad-
ratha was the son of Bṛhatkṣatra only means that he was a descendant of that king.</F>
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth and attainment of Boon.%} Jayadratha was born as
a result of severe fasts and vows taken by his father.
There was an ethereal voice at the birth of Jayadratha,
“This child would become a very famous King.
The head of him, who puts down the head of this child
on the earth would break into a hundred pieces within a
moment” His father was filled with joy when he heard
this ethereal voice, and so he made Jayadratha King at
[Page353-b+ 62]
a very young age and went to Samantapañcaka to per-
form penance. (M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chapter 146).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Marriage.%} It is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Ādi
Parva, Chapter 116, Stanza 17, that Jayadratha married
the princess Dusśalā.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Jayadratha and Pāñcālī.%} From the very beginning
Jayadratha was a bitter enemy of the Pāṇḍavas. It is
not difficult to find out the root of this enmity. It is
stated in Ādi Parva, Chapter 185, Stanza 21 that Jayad-
ratha was present at the svayaṃvara of Pāñcālī. The
fact that he did not get Pāñcālī, might have laid the
foundation of this enmity.
<div n="NI"/>From this moment Jayadratha was looking forward to a
chance to carry off Pāñcālī.
<div n="NI"/>The forest life of the Pāṇḍavas began. They wandered
through many forests and finally reached the forest,
Kāmyaka. Once the Pāṇḍavas left Pāñcālī alone in the
hut and went to the forest for hunting. Jayadratha
came to know of this. He came with his men to the
place where the hut stood. At the very first sight of
Pāñcālī, he fell in love with her. He sent Koṭikāsya,
the King of Trigarta, who was the son of Suratha as a
messenger to Pāñcālī. Koṭikāsya told Pāñcālī about the
superior qualities of Jayadratha and requested her to
accept Jayadratha, leaving the Pāṇḍavas. But she
rejected his request. The messenger returned to Jayad-
ratha and told him what had happened. Jayadratha
himself came in a chariot and tried to entice her.
Pāñcālī did not yield. Jayadratha caught her by force
and took her away in his chariot. Dhaumya the priest
of the Pāṇḍavas followed them with tears. Shortly after-
wards, the Pāṇḍavas returned to the hut. They searched
for Pāñcālī here and there. They heard everything
from a maid, and instantly followed Jayadratha, whose
army confronted the Pāṇḍavas. The heads of almost all
the warriors of Jayadratha fell on the ground. Jayad-
ratha fled from the battlefield. The Pāṇḍavas followed
him and caught him and scourged him. Bhīma shaved
his head letting only five hairs to stand on the head.
They took him as a prisoner before Dharmaputra.
Finally at the instruction of Yudhiṣṭhira and Pāñcālī,
he was released. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapters 264 to
272).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) In the sacrifice of Rājasūya (imperial consecration)
performed by Yudhiṣṭhira, Jayadratha took part as a
tributary King. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 34,
Stanza 8).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Jayadratha was present at the game of dice between
Duryodhana and Yudhiṣṭhira. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter
58, Stanza 28).
<div n="NI"/>(3) It was while going to Sālva to marry a damsel that
Jayadratha attacked Pāñcālī at the forest of Kāmyaka.
(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 264).
<div n="NI"/>(4) Feeling ashamed at the result of his attempt to
carry off Pāñcālī, Jayadratha went direct to Gaṅgā-
dvāra and pleased Śiva by penance. Śiva gave him the
boon that he would be able to defeat all the Pāṇḍavas
except Arjuna. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 272).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Jayadratha in the battle of Bhārata.%}
In the battle of Bhārata, which lasted for eighteen days
between the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas, Jayadratha
[Page354-a+ 65]
took the side of the Kauravas and fought against the
Pāṇḍavas. The part played by him in the battle is given
below:—

of this. (M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chapter 74, Stanzas 4
to 12).
<div n="NI"/>(8) He began to combat with Arjuna. (M.B. Droṇa
Parva, Chapter, 145).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%The death of Jayadratha.%} When a fierce fight began
between Arjuna and Jayadratha, Śrī Kṛṣṇa came to
Arjuna and said, “Arjuna, there was an ethereal voice
at the birth of Jayadratha. The head of the person who
puts down the head of Jayadratha on the earth, would
be broken into a hundred pieces. So send an arrow in
such a way that his head falls on the lap of his father.”
Hearing this, Arjuna sent an arrow which cut off the
head of Jayadratha and the head fell in the lap of Jayad-
ratha's father who had been sitting in deep penance
and meditation in Samantapañcaka. Instantly the father
awoke from meditation and stood up and the head of
his beloved son, with ear-rings on both ears fell on the
earth and the head of the father was broken into a
hundred pieces and he died. (Droṇa Parva, Chapter
146, Stanzas 104 to 130).
