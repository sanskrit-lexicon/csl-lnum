SĪTĀ¦. Wife of Śrī Rāma.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Who is Sītā?%} Sītā is the incarnation of Mahālakṣmī.
Lakṣmī took the birth of a woman because of the curse
of Sarasvatī. Vedavatī, Sītā, Pāñcālī, all these women
of chastity were the incarnations of Lakṣmī The stories
of Lakṣmī passing from birth to birth such as Vedavatī,
Tulasī, Sītā, Pāñcālī and so on until at last she reached the
[Page720-b+ 65]
world of Viṣṇu, occurring in various Purāṇas are
collected and given here.
<div n="NI"/>Lakṣmī, Sarasvatī and Gaṅgā were the wives of Mahā-
viṣṇu. One day Viṣṇu was sitting with his three wives
and entertaining them with conversation when Devī
Gaṅgā looked at Viṣṇu amorously. Instantly a quarrel
arose among the three of them. When the row became
uncontrollable, Sarasvatī cursed Lakṣmī to take birth
in the earth as a plant. Gaṇgā cursed Sarasvatī and
made her a river. Sarasvatī cursed Gaṅgā and made her
a river. At the end of all these rows and curses Viṣṇu
stood up and said to Lakṣmī. “Lakṣmī! you will take
birth as the daughter of Dharmadhvaja on the earth
with the name Tulasī. In order that the curse of Sarasvatī
may come true, a plant called Tulasī (holy basil) will
grow up on the earth from a portion of you. While
you are living as the daughter of Dharmadhvaja, an
asura named Śaṅkhacūḍa born from my portion will
marry you.”
<div n="NI"/>The curse was realized. Sarasvatī and Gaṅgā became
rivers. Lakṣmī was about to be born as the daughter
of Dharmadhvaja. Who was Dharmadhvaja? He was
a man of righteous deeds and good qualities, born of
the family of Dakṣasāvarṇi who was born from a portion
of Mahāviṣṇu. Brahmasāvarṇī was born from Dakṣasā-
varni. Dharmasāvarṇi begot Rudrasāvarṇi, Indrasā-
varṇi begot Vṛṣadhvaja. Rathadhvaja was the son
of Vṛṣadhvaja. Two sons named Dharmadhvaja and
Kuśadhvaja were born to Rathadhvaja. Dharmadhvaja
and Kuśadhvaja were performing penance before Devī
Lakṣmī to regain the wealth and prosperity lost by the
curse of the Sun.
<div n="NI"/>How did Dharmadhvaja and Kuśadhvaja lose their
prosperity? Their grandfather Vṛṣadhvaja was a devotee
of Śiva. He performed penance before Śiva for a long
time. Śiva became pleased with Vṛṣadhvaja and lived
in his hermitage for the period of three Devayugas. This
king Vṛṣadhvaja made a proclamation that none other
than Śiva should be worshipped. As all the other gods
were despised, the Sun got angry and cursed Vṛṣadhvaja.
“Let the prosperity of yours and your posterity be dest-
royed.” Śiva did not like the action taken by the Sun
against his favourite. Śiva took his trident and went
against the Sun, who took refuge near his father Pra-
jāpati Kaśyapa. Kaśyapa complained to Brahmā.
Brahmā ran to Vaikuṇṭha. Śiva also came there with
his trident. Viṣṇu looked at them and said “You
gods, hear this. What is the need of all this hurry?
Within the short time you have taken to run up to this
place so many years have elapsed in the world. It is a
long time since Vṛṣadhavaja died. His son Rathadhvaja
also is dead. Rathadhvaja has two sons named Dhar-
madhvaja and Kuśadhvaja. They both have become
Kings. But because of the curse of the Sun, they are
devoid of any radiance. They are now worshipping
Mahālakṣmī for radiance.” Hearing this talk of Mahā-
viṣṇu all of them returned to their places.
<div n="NI"/>It has been mentioned that Dharmadhvaja and Kuśa-
dhvaja had been engaged in penance before Mahālakṣmī.
Devī Mahālakṣmī appeared before them and granted
their wish. Devī promised them that she would take
birth as the daughter of each of them, and she would
recover for them all the wealth and prosperity they had
lost. Accordingly Mahālakṣmī took birth by her portion
as the daughter of Mādhavī, the wife of Dharmadhvaja
[Page721-a+ 65]
under the name Tulasī. (For the rest of the story of
Tulasī see under Tulasī, Para 4).
<div n="NI"/>Mālāvatī was the wife of Kuśadhvaja. As Lakṣmī had
promised to take birth as their daughter, both of them
waited for the birth of the child uttering the Vedas. At
this time a child was born from the mouth of Kuśadh-
vaja. This child was the incarnation of Lakṣmī. With
the birth of the child Kuśadhvaja regained all the
wealth and prosperity he had lost. The child was named
Vedavatī (Devavatī). She grew up and became a young
woman. Her desire was to get Mahāviṣṇu as her husband.
Once an asura named Śambhu came to the hermitage
of Kuśadhvaja. When he saw Vedavatī he fell in love
with her. He asked Kuśadhvaja for the hand of his
daughter, but Kuśadhvaja did not give his consent.
<div n="NI"/>Śambhu got angry. He came back in the night and kill-
ed Kuśadhvaja with his sword. Hearing the sound Veda-
vatī woke up and saw the dead body of her father lying
in a pool of blood. She looked at Śambhu angrily. In
that fiery look Śambhu was burnt to ashes.
<div n="NI"/>Vedavatī began to perform very severe penance to get
Viṣṇu as her husband. It was at this time that Rāvaṇa
had begun his campaign of conquest. He defeated all
kings and was proceeding victoriously through the
vicinity of the Himālayas, when he saw the beautiful
damsel Vedavatī sitting alone and performing penance.
Seeing so beautiful a girl engaged in penance, he told
her that he was the famous Rāvaṇa with ten heads and
requested her to throw away the garment of bark of the
tree and the matted hair and to accept him as her
husband. She rejected his request. The angry Rāvaṇa
caught hold of her hand. She resisted using her teeth and
finger-nails. She cried out that she wanted no more to
retain the body made impure by the touch of a wicked
person. She made a fire and jumped into it. Thus in
the sight of Rāvaṇa, she burnt herself to death. Before
death she vowed that in the next birth Mahāviṣṇu would
become her husband and would kill Rāvaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Rāvaṇa who himself was burning in the fire of amour,
was extremely sorry at the death of the beautiful girl.
He took the ashes of hers to Laṅkā and put them in a
golden box and kept the box in a solitary place. He used
to visit the place daily. Since the arrival of the ashes,
bad omens began to occur in Laṅkā. One day Nārada
came to Laṅkā. Rāvaṇa asked Nārada for the reason of
constant occurrences of bad omens in Laṅkā. Nārada
replied that the cause of bad omens was the golden box
he was keeping and that if it was kept in Laṅkā any
longer, it would cause destruction and that if it was
destroyed, great disaster would follow. Nārada advised
Rāvaṇa to remove the box without opening it to some-
where else outside Laṅkā. Accordingly Rāvaṇa caused
the golden box to be dropped in the sea. By and by it
came with the waves to the shore of Bhārata (India).
Robbers took it and went to the north and hid it in a
forest. They were not able to take it away again. Thus
the box came to be deposited on the basin of a river in
Mithilā.
<div n="NI"/>It was this river-basin that King Janaka selected as
the place for sacrifice. Being kept in this holy place,
the ashes of the body of Devavatī in the box mingled
with her spirit and was taking shape into a child. When
the place was ploughed for preparing the spot of sacri-
fice, for Janaka, this golden box was discovered. The
child which was inside the box, was taken home and
[Page721-b+ 64]
brought up by the king who named her Sītā. It was
the portion of this Sītā herself that took birth next as
Pāñcālī. (Devī Bhāgavata, Kamba Rāmāyaṇa)
<div n="NI"/>{%Other versions.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) The King Padmākṣa performed penance before
Mahāviṣṇu with a view to get Mahālakṣmī as daughter.
Mahāviṣṇu gave the King a great Phallus to realize
his wish. From that a beautiful girl was born. The
King named her Padmā. When she attained marriage-
able age, the King made preparations for her Svayaṃ-
vara (the bride herself choosing a husband). On the
day fixed for the marriage Rākṣasas came and destroy-
ed all the preparations and killed King Padmākṣa.
Because of her sorrow at this disaster Padmā jumped
into the fire. The giants searched for Padmā every
where, but they could not find her. They returned in
disappointment.
<div n="NI"/>One day, during this period, Rāvaṇa was travelling in
his Aerial chariot. When he reached this place, he
saw Padmā who had come out of the fire. Rāvaṇa was
fascinated by the beauty of Padmā. So he turned
towards her. Seeing this, Padmā again jumped into
the pile of fire for safety. Without any delay Rāvaṇa
made a search in the pile of fire. At last he got the
body of Padmā (Sītā) in the form of five jewels. The
disappointed Rāvaṇa placed the five jewels in a
box and took it to Laṅkā and gave it to his wife
Mandodarī. One day Mandodarī opened that box
and saw Padmā sitting in the form of a beautiful
virgin. Thinking that it was not propitious to keep
her who was the cause of destruction to Padmākṣa, his
family and kingdom, Mandodarī exerted pressure on
Rāvaṇa to cast the box out of Laṅkā. Rāvaṇa with
his men took the box from Laṅkā and buried it in
Mithilā. Before the box was closed Padmā cursed
Rāvaṇa. “I will come to Laṅkā again to kill you and
your clan.”
<div n="NI"/>One day when a brahmin of Mithilā was ploughing
his field he got this box. Thinking that it belonged to
the King, the brahmin took the box to King Janaka.
The King took the child in the box and brought it up.
He named the child Sītā. (Ānanda Rāmāyaṇa, 7-6).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) In Adbhuta Rāmāyaṇa we see another story which
is somewhat different from that we see in Ānanda
Rāmāyaṇa. It is given below:—
<div n="NI"/>Rāvaṇa who had become the harasser of the entire
world began to harass the hermits and sages also. He
used to shoot arrows at the hermits who were sitting in
meditation in the forests, and taking their blood in the
arrow-head, he stored it in a big pot. In the same
forest a hermit named Gṛtsamada was engaged in
penance to get a daughter who would be equal to
Lakṣmī in everyway. He took milk with the head of
Darbha grass and stored it daily in a pot. One day
Rāvaṇa came to his hermitage and took the pot of
milk stealthily. He poured the milk into the pot in
which he had stored the blood and stirring it well gave
it to his wife Mandodarī. Seeing the character of her
husband becoming worse and worse every day, Mando-
darī became miserable. One day she decided to
commit suicide and drank the contents of the pot
given by Rāvaṇa. The thing which was taken for
suicide, made her pregnant. Mandodarī buried that
foetus in Kurukṣetra. After a while a girl was born
[Page722-a+ 65]
from it. That child was Sītā, the daughter of King
Janaka.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) There is a story in Devī Bhāgavata stating how
Sītā was born as the daughter of Rāvaṇa. It is as
follows:
<div n="NI"/>Rāvaṇa wished to marry Mandodarī, the daughter of
Maya. Then Maya said to Rāvaṇa thus:—“Accord-
ing to the horoscope of Mandodarī, the first child born
to her will be the destroyer of its clan. So it would be
better to kill that child.” Not acting upon the advice
of Maya, Rāvaṇa put the first child in a box and
buried it in the city of King Janaka. This child was
Sītā, the wife of Śrī Rāma.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Marriage.%} Sītā grew up in the palace of King
Janaka. Kuśadhvaja the younger brother of Janaka
had three daughters. They were named Māṇḍavī,
Ūrmilā and Śrutakīrti. Sītā grew up along with these
three sisters. The four of them grew up as sisters and
friends. Sītā grew up to be a young woman. Several
young men wished to marry her. Janaka refused
everyone of them. One day the princesses were play-
ing with their maids in the garden of the harem. Sītā
sat on the dais in the centre of the garden to make a
flower garland. All their attempts to gather the jasmine
flowers from the twigs of a large mango tree in the
garden ended in failure. Śītā instantly ran to the
weapon house and taking a bow and arrow, shot down
the flowers. The flowers fell down on the cloth placed
on the ground without being damaged. Janaka saw the
shooting of Sītā, from the palace. He was amazed at
the expertness of Sītā. The bow which Sītā took was
Śaivacāpa (the bow of Śiva). Śiva had used this bow,
in days of old, to destroy the sacrifice of Dakṣa. Śiva,
who was pacified by the destruction of the sacrifice of
Dakṣa and the victory over his enemies, gave this bow
to his devotee, the King of Videha. That King kept
the bow in his weapon-house and used to worship it.
Śītā had taken that bow and shot with it.
<div n="NI"/>The King who had been thinking about the marriage
of Sītā thought that what he saw was a good omen. So
the King made a proclamation that only he who could
take the bow of Śiva, draw it, and shoot with it would
become eligible to marry Sītā. Hearing this many
adventurers came to the palace and tried to handle the
Śaivacāpa and retreated admitting defeat. It was at
this time that Viśvāmitra brought Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa
to the forest for the protection of sacrifice. Hearing
about the Svayaṃvara of Sītā, Viśvāmitra took the
princes to the palace of Janaka. The King was greatly
pleased when he learned that the princes were the sons
of Daśaratha, of the solar Dynasty. Next morning,
at the instruction of his elders and priests and teachers,
Śrī Rāma stood on the dais in the middle of the hall,
where the Śaivacāpa was placed, ready to handle it.
He lifted up the bow with his left hand, drew it easily
and fastened the string tightly and the bow was broken.
When the Kings who were present, heard the roaring
sound of the breaking of the bow, they shivered with
fear as serpents at the sound of thunder. Sītā jumped
with joy like a peacock. A letter was sent to Daśaratha
then and there. Friends and relatives arrived. Under
the guidance of the presiding priest Śatānanda, the
marriage ceremony was conducted. Rāma married
Sītā, Bharata married Māṇḍavī, Lakṣmaṇa married
Ūrmilā, and Śatrughna married Śrutakīrti. The brides
[Page722-b+ 65]
and bridegrooms went to Ayodhyā with their parents
and relatives. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Anasūyā's gift of clothes and ornaments.%} Daśaratha
who had become old, wished to hand over the realm to
Śrī Rāma. Since Kaikeyī stood as a hindrance, the
kingdom fell into the hands of Bharata. Moreover
Sītā had to live in the forest with Śrī Rāma and
Lakṣmaṇa for fourteen years. In the early period of
their forest-life they visited the hermitage of Atri.
Seeing the devotion of Sītā towards her husband,
Anasūyā the wife of hermit Atri, blessed her and
gave her a fine garland, clothes and ornaments and
cosmetics. Anasūyā blessed Sītā again and said that
she would shine as Lakṣmī if she besmeared her body
with the divine cosmetics. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Ayodhyā
Kāṇḍa, Sargas 118-120).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Test by Pārvatī and Parameśvara.%} In the last year of
forest-life Pārvatī and Parameśvara tested the firmness
of the love of Sītā and Rāma. (See under Rāma, Para
14).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Phantom Sītā.%} A few days before the abduction of
Sītā by Rāvaṇa, Fire god took the guise of a Brahmin
and approached Śrī Rāma and said: “O, Śrī Rāma!
The Devas have sent me to tell you certain things
which will take place shortly. Your incarnation has
the aim of killing Rāvaṇa. Sītā is meant to be a cause
for the same. The death of Rāvaṇa is imminent. He
will come and carry Sītā away. So entrust Sītā with
me. I will keep her carefully. Make a phantom
(Māyā) Sītā and keep her here, instead of the real
Sītādevī. After the killing of Rāvaṇa, when Sītā enters
fire as a proof of her purity, I will return Devī Sītā.”
<div n="NI"/>Śrī Rāma agreed to it. Fire god by his power of contem-
plation, created a phantom Sītā, exactly like the real
Sītā in shape and figure and nature and placing her beside
Rāma, he disappeared with the real Sītā. Even Lakṣmaṇa
was not aware of this fact. The real Sītā Devī was under
the care of Fire god till the moment of the test of chastity
of Sītā by fire, after the killing of Rāvaṇa. During the
time of entering the fire the illusory Sītā vanished in
the fire and the real Sītā came out. (Devī Bhāgavata,
Skandha 9).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Sītā killed Sahasramukha.%} See under Sahasramukha
Rāvaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Abandonment of Sītā.%} See under Rāma, Para 31.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Sītā in the hermitage of Vālmīki.%} Abandoned Sītā, who
was pregnant, wandered about in the forest and at last
reached the hermitage of Vālmīki, who gave her protect-
ion and shelter. The story of an occurrence at this
time is given in Kathāsaritsāgara, Alaṅkāravatīlambaka,
Taraṅga 1.
<div n="NI"/>The other hermits did not like Vālmīki's action of giving
shelter to Sītā. They said “Sītā is impure. Otherwise
her husband would not have abandoned her. By her
association we also would become sinners. As the hermit
Vālmīki is kind, he will not cast her away especially
when she is pregnant. So the best thing for all of us, is
to go to another hermitage.” This murmuring of the
hermits reached the ears of Vālmīki. He said “She is
pure and chaste. I know it with my inward eyes.” But
they did not believe it. Then Sīta said “Lord! you can
test my chastity in whatever way you like, and if I am
found to be impure you may cut off my head.”
<div n="NI"/>The hermits tested Sītā in the Ṭiṭṭibhasaras (a
divine lake near the hermitage of Vālmīki) and were
[Page723-a+ 65]
convinced that she was chaste and pure. (See under
Ṭiṭṭibhasaras to know the greatness of this divine lake).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Cursed Sītā.%} Sītā was spending miserable days in the
hermitage of Vālmīki. Her matrimonial life was a hell.
Is there any special reason for misery? Yes. It is the
curse of a bird. Once Śeṣa told this story, of the cursing
of Sītā by a bird, to the hermit Vātsyāyana. That story
is given below:
<div n="NI"/>The event took place when Sītā was a young girl in the
palace of Janaka. One day while Sītā was playing in
the garden she saw two parrots, cock and hen, which
talked well. The spouses were delightfully engaged in
love-making. As soon as the couple saw Sītā they flew
up to a tree and sang thus: “A handsome king will take
birth on the earth. His name will be Śrī Rāma. His
wife's name will be Sītā. Their wedded life will be
happy.
<div n="NI"/>Hearing the song, Sītā thought that they were some
divine persons, and asked her maids to catch them and
give them food. The maids caught the parrots and
brought them before Sītā. She asked the birds.
“Don't fear. Who are you? Where do you come from?
Who is that Rāma? Who is Sītā? How did you come to
know of them? Tell me all. I will not hurt you!
<div n="NI"/>The birds replied. “In the forest there is a hermit named
Vālmīki. We live in his beautiful hermitage. That
hermit has composed the story Rāmāyaṇa, which is yet
to happen, and has taught it to his disciples. We have
heard those songs. Having heard them over and over
we also have learned them by heart. We will tell you
who Rāma is and who Jānakī is and what would happen
to her who lives happily with him. Hear it! Saying
thus the parrots passed on to the story of Rāma. Due to
the sacrifice of the hermit Ṛṣyaśṛṅga, Mahāviṣṇu incar-
nated as four persons, of whom Rāma the eldest, with his
younger brother and Viśvāmitra, would come to
Mithilā. He would draw the bow and marry Sītā...
<div n="NI"/>Sītā was extremely pleased with the sweet song of
the birds and asked them so many questions repeatedly
with curiosity. Seeing the excitement of the questioner
the parrots understood that she was Sītā herself. They
asked her. “Beautiful girl! who are you? Why are you
so much interested in knowing about Rāma? What is
your name?” Sītā disclosed everything about her to
the birds, and said “I am the same Sītā, the daughter
of Janaka you have sung about. I will let you go only on
the day when that handsome prince Rāma comes and
marries me. Your conversation has made me so curious.
You can live comfortably in my house, eating sweet-
meats.” The birds were in great fear when they heard
this. They looked at each other and replied to Sītā.
“Good child! we birds fly about in the sky and perch on
trees and bush. Houses are not comfortable to us. More-
over I am pregnant. After my delivery in our own place
I will come here. You need not have any doubt.” The
female parrot said thus. But Sītā did not let them go.
Then the male parrot prayed humbly with anxiety.
“Sītā, allow her to go. Why do you detain my beauti-
ful wife? Allow us to have our own way in the forest.
My wife is pregnant. After the confinement both of us
will come back.” Sītā said “Let her live with me. You
may go as you please.”
<div n="NI"/>The parrots were in great sorrow. If they had not made
any noise on that tree this detention would not have
occurred. These pitiable supplications had no effect on
[Page723-b+ 65]
Sītā. The male bird cried to Sītā to let him take his
mate along with him, and beat his head on the ground.
Sītā was adamant. The female bird, filled with misery
and anger cursed Sītā thus. “You have separated me
from my husband. I am pregnant. May you too be
separated from your husband when you become preg-
nant”. When she had finished saying, she fell on the
ground and wriggled and died. An acrial chariot came
down to the earth from heaven for the soul of that bird
which had died exalting and glorifying Śrī Rāma. The
soul of the bird got into the chariot and went up to
heaven. The male bird, being unable to bear the death
of his beloved wife, dipped himself in the Gaṅgā. Before
his death he cried out in anger. “I must be born in the
city of Rāma. By my words, this Sītā should be sepa-
rated from her husband and fall into misery.” He died
in the Ganges in Krodha (anger) and fear. So he took
rebirth with the name Krodhana as a washerman by
caste and profession. It was this washerman who spoke
words of calumny about Sītā. Due to the calumny of
this washerman, Śrī Rāma abandoned Sītā and she
had to take shelter in the hermitage of Vālmīki.
(Padma Purāṇa, Pātāla Khaṇḍa, Chapter 57).
