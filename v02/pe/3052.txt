KAIKASĪ¦. Mother of Rāvaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} From the wrath of Brahmā the giant
Praheti was born and from Brahmā's hunger the demi-
god Heti was born. The son Vidyutkeśa was born to
Heti, of Bhayā the sister of Kāla (God of death—Time).
Vidyutkeśa married Sālakaṭaṅkā the daughter of
Sandhyā. A son named Sukeśa was born to them.
Sukeśa married Devavatī daughter of Maṇimaya, a
Gandharva. Three sons Mālyavān, Sumālī and Mālī
were born to them. The three brothers Mālyavān,
Sumālī and Mālī married Sundarī, Ketumatī and
Vasudhā respectively, the three daughters of Narmadā,
a gandharva woman. To Sumālī, by his wife Ketumatī,
were born the ten sons, Prahasta, Akampana, Vikaṭa,
Kālakāmukha, Dhūmrākṣa, Daṇḍa, Supārśva, Saṃ-
hrāda, Prākvāta and Bhāsakarṇa and four daughters
Vekā (Bṛhā), Puṣpotkaṭā, Kaikasī and Kumbhīnasī.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Marriage.%} As Sumālī was walking through forests
with his wives and daughters, he saw so many Yakṣas
(demi-gods) going in planes to pay homage to
Vaiśravaṇa. Sumālī understood that Vaiśravaṇa
became worthy of homage because he was the son of
Viśravas. So he took his daughter Kaikasī and left
her in the house of Viśravas. After a while, being
[Page364-b+ 65]
pleased with her services, Viśravas took her as his
wife. Once she requested her husband for children.
Accordingly she got Rāvaṇa, Kumbhakarṇa and
Vibhīṣaṇa as sons.
