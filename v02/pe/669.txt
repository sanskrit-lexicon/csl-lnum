AYODHYĀ¦. A city in North India which enjoyed great
importance and reputation for many years as the capi-
tal of the Kings of the solar dynasty. (See Ikṣvāku
dynasty). All the Kings of this dynasty ruled the coun-
try from this city as their capital. Vasiṣṭha, the great
preceptor of the Ikṣvāku Rājas, came to Ayodhyā dur-
ing the period of the reign of Kalmāṣapāda, who was
the thirty-fifth ruler in succession to Ikṣvāku. A quarrel
broke out between Kalmāṣapāda and Vasiṣṭha during
a hunting expedition, and Vasiṣṭha cursed the King
and as the result the latter became a Rākṣasa. After
regaining his former form as King, he apologised to
Vasiṣṭha and they became friends again. At the requ-
est of the King in the interests of his dynasty Vasiṣṭha
came to Ayodhyā, and the people were greatly elated.
A son was born to Vasiṣṭha by Kalmāṣapāda's wife and
that son was Aśmaka. After that Vasiṣṭha used to go to
Ayodhyā frequently and was installed as family precep-
tor of the Ikṣvākus. Till the time of Śrī Rāma the city
of Ayodhyā maintained its pomp and glory, and after
that gradually its decay and fall set in. Laudatory refe-
rences to the city are found in most of the Purāṇas
like the Mahābhārata, Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa etc. (See
Kosala).
