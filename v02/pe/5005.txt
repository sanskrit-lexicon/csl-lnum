PĀṆINI¦. The author of the Sanskrit Grammar, Pāṇi-
nīya.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} There is nowhere else in this
world a grammar so scientific and so complete as
Pāṇinīya. The book contains about four thousand
aphorisms. Pāṇini was an inspired sage and he got his
knowledge from Śiva. It has not been possible to gather
much information about the life of such a celebrated
grammarian. Patañjali believes that he was the son of
Dākṣi. He addresses Pāṇini as Acārya, Bhagavān and
Maharṣi. The Chinese traveller Huen Tsang says that
the grammar of all the languages in this world has its
origin from Pāṇinīya. Rāmabhadradīkṣita says that
Pāṇini was the son of the sage Pāṇi.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Life period.%} There is difference of opinion regarding
the period during which Pāṇini lived. Dr. Goldstucker and
Bhandarkar believe that Pāṇini lived before 500 B.C.
while Vincent Smith and Belvelkar fix the period in
700 B.C. Patañjali, the author of the celebrated
‘Mahābhāṣya’ (commentary on Pāṇinīya) lived in
200 B.C. Patañjali has contradicted many of the un-
just criticisms made by Kātyāyana about Pāṇinīya. So
Pāṇini must have lived before Kātyāyana. Pāṇini has
made no reference to Buddha and so he must have
lived before Buddha. Pāṇini has shown great grasp
over the laws of Smṛti and so he must have lived after
Manu. Considering all these facts together it will be
proper to fix the period of the end of the sixth century
or the beginning of the seventh century B.C.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Place of birth.%} Evidences are lacking to correctly
fix the birth-place of Pāṇini. Many pandits believe
that Pāṇini was born in the village of Śālātura in the
city of Attock in the state of Gāndhāra. But Pāṇini has
spent the major portion of his life in Pāṭalīputra. So
some pandits are of opinion that only the ancestors
of Pāṇini belonged to the village of Śālātura and
Pāṇini was born and brought up in Pāṭalīputra.
Jaimini and Bhartṛhari have stated that Pāṇini was a
Śiṣṭa. Śiṣṭas were brahmins well-versed in the Śāstras
and devoid of earthly pleasures who inhabited the area
surrounded by the Himālayas in the north, Kālakavana
(Bengal) in the east, Vindhya mountains in the south
and the Ādarśa (Aravalli mountains) in the west.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%A legend.%} There was a preceptor named Varṣa in
Pāṭalīputra and Pāṇini had his education under him.
Varṣa gradually acquired a large number of disciples
and Pāṇini was the most dull-witted among them. But
he was greatly devoted to his Guru and this pleased
[Page566-b+ 64]
the wife of the Guru and she took great interest in
Pāṇini. One day she called Pāṇini to her side and
advised him to go to the Himālayas and do penance
to propitiate Śiva to get knowledge from him. Pāṇini
obeying instructions went and performed penance.
Śiva was pleased and he granted him knowledge about
a new grammar. By the time Pāṇini came back from
the Himālayas with his grammar another disciple of
Varṣa, Vararuci by name, had come down with a
grammar from Indra. Pāṇini challenged Vararuci for a
polemical contest. It took eight days and on the eighth
day Vararuci defeated Pāṇini. At once there was a
great humming sound from the sky and the grammar
book of Vararuci was destroyed. After that Pāṇini
defeated all his co-disciples in polemics and emerged
as the greatest grammarian of the world. (Kathāpīṭha-
lambaka, Kathāsaritsāgara, Taraṅga 4).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The birth of Pāṇinīya.%} When Pāṇini was doing
penance to propitiate Śiva the latter appeared before
him and started dancing. He sounded his musical
instrument ḍhakkā (a large double drum) fourteen
times. Each of it produced a different sound as follows
(1) Aiuṇ (2) Ṛḷk (3) Eoṅ (4) Aiauc (5) Hayavaraṭ
(6) laṇ (7) ñamaṅaṇanam (8) Jhabhañ (9) Ghaḍha-
dhaṣ (10) Jabagaḍadaś (11) Khaphachaṭhathacaṭatav
(12) Kapay (13) Śaṣasar (14) Hal. Pāṇini accepted
these fourteen sounds as fourteen sūtras (aphorisms).
They are called Pratyāhārasūtras. (The comprehension
of several letters or affixes into one syllable effected
by combining the first letter of a Sūtra with its final
indicatory letter.). These Sūtras are now known as
Māheśvarasūtras.
<div n="NI"/>Pāṇini's grammar contains eight chapters and each
chapter has got four pādas and each pāda contains
many sūtras. He has taken examples from worldly
and spiritual texts in literature. He has dealt with the
origin of sounds, connection between two words and
all such etymological details. Pāṇini's grammar is not a
mere grammar book. It is a science of language in it-
self.
