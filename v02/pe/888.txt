BALABHADRA¦. (Balabhadrarāma, Balarāma, Baladeva).
The elder brother of Śrī Kṛṣṇa and the eighth incarna-
tion of Mahāviṣṇu.
<F>*) Since the life of Balabhadra is so mixed with that of Kṛṣṇa a complete life story of Balarāma could be had only if it is read along
with that of Kṛṣṇa.</F>
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} When the number of wicked kings increased
Bhūmīdevī (goddess of Earth) turned herself into a cow
and took refuge in Mahāviṣṇu. Mahāviṣṇu then pro-
mised to be born as the sons of Vasudeva named Bala-
bhadrarāma and Śrī Kṛṣṇa and destroy the wicked.
Vasudeva was the son of the Yādava, Śūrasena, King
of Madhurā. To Devaka the brother of another Yādava
King, Ugrasena, was born a daughter Devakī. The
marriage of Devakī with Vasudeva was celebrated but
on the same day an Aśarīriṇī (a heavenly voice from
above) said that the eighth child of Devakī would
kill Kaṃsa. Instantly Kaṃsa put both Vasudeva and
Devakī in jail. The first six sons born to Devakī were
killed the moment they were born by striking them
against the ground. Devakī became pregnant for the
seventh time. The babe in the womb was Ananta in-
carnate by Viṣṇu's directive to be of help to him when
he would also be born soon as Kṛṣṇa. Therefore it
was necessary to save the child from the cruel hands
of Kaṃsa as it was certain he would kill the babe the
same way he had killed all the others before. So he
ordered Māyādevī to take the child from the womb of
Devakī and place it in that of Rohiṇī, another wife of
Vasudeva. Māyādevī did so and the boy got the name
Saṃgharṣaṇa, also because of this. The news spread
that Devakī aborted. Rohiṇī delivered a boy and was
named Saṃgharṣaṇa alias Balabhadrarāma. (Daśama
Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The colour of Balarāma and Śrī Kṛṣṇa.%} Śrī Kṛṣṇa is
the eighth child of Devakī. The elder brother Balarāma
is white in complexion while the younger, Śrī Kṛṣṇa is
black in complexion. There is a story behind this. The
devas decided to be born as Gopālas (shepherds) in the
earth to be of help to Kṛṣṇa in his duty of killing the
wicked. They informed Mahāviṣṇu of their decision
and the Lord was immensely pleased. He then took
one white hair from his head and said that it would go
to Rohiṇī's womb and change into Balarāma and
[Page100-a+ 64]
taking a black hair said that it would go into Devakī's
womb and change into Śrī Kṛṣṇa. It was thus that
Balabhadra became white and Śrī Kṛṣṇa black. (Chap-
ter 199, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Brothers.%} Balabhadrarāma had six brothers born of
his mother Rohiṇī. They were: Gada, Sāraṇa, Durd-
dama, Vipula, Dhruva, and Kṛta. (Navama Skandha,
Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>4) Till their marriage Śrī Kṛṣṇa spent his childhood
in Aṃbāḍi and Balarāma, in Madhurā. Once the sage
Garga went to the house of Vasudeva and it was he
who then told the story behind the births of Balarāma
and Kṛṣṇa. Hearing this Vasudeva went to Madhurā
and brought Balabhadrarāma also to Aṃbāḍi. Garga-
muni then performed all those sacred rites which were
usually done to boys of that age and both of them then
remained in Aṃbāḍi. Several important events happen-
ed during their stay here, notable among which are:
Pūtanāmokṣam (killing of the demoness Pūtanā and
giving her salvation). Śakaṭāsuravadha (killing the
asura, Śakaṭa), Tṛṇāvarttavadha (killing the asura,
Tṛṇāvartta), Vatsāsuravadha (killing the asura,
Vatsa), Bakavadha (killing the demon bird, Baka),
Aghāsuravadha (killing the asura, Agha), Dhenukā-
suravadha (killing the asura, Dhenuka), Kāliamardana
(beating the snake, Kālia) and Pralambavadha (killing
Pralamba). (See under Kṛṣṇa for more details).
<div n="NI"/>Kaṃsa conducted a Cāpapūjā (worship of the bow) to
kill Kṛṣṇa. It was on a festive scale and both Kṛṣṇa and
Balarāma went to Madhurā to attend the same. There
they killed Kaṃsa and after that went to the āśrama
of Sāndīpani Maharṣi for education. When they complet-
ed their education they at the request of the preceptor
gave as Gurudakṣiṇā (The fee you pay in the end for
the instructions given) the lost child of the guru. Then
they went to Madhurā and there several events took
place, important among which was the fight between
Kṛṣṇa and Jarāsandha. By this time the Yādavas
were becoming lean financially and so to make some
money Kṛṣṇa and Rāma went to the diamond-infested
mountain of Gomantaka. On their way they met
Paraśurāma doing penance under a Banyan tree. On
the advice of Paraśurāma they killed Sṛgālavasudeva
and got immense wealth. On their return Rāma and
Kṛṣṇa along with many Yādavas went and settled down
in the island, Dvārakā, in the western ocean. (Daśama
Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Marriage.%} Before the advent of Balarāma and Kṛṣṇa
the island Dvārakā was known as Kuśasthalī. It was
ruled over by a famous Rājarṣi, Revata. This king was
the son of King Ānartta and grandson of emperor
Śaryāti. Revata got a hundred sons, Kukudmin being
the first and a daughter named Revatī. When the time
for marriage of his daughter came the King was anxious
to find out a fitting husband for her and he went to
Brahmaloka to take the advice of Brahmā. Revatī also
accompanied him. There stupefied he saw Vedas, Yajñas,
mountains, rivers, oceans, Ṛtus, all in divine figures
standing before Brahmā, worshipping him. The sweet
celestial songs gave them both untold happiness. He
then told Brahmā the purpose of his visit and Brahmā
meditating for some time told him that Balabhadrarāma,
son of Vasudeva, was the only one person suited for
her. The king returned to Dvārakā and gave his
[Page100-b+ 65]
daughter in marriage to Balarāma. (Saptama Skandha,
Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%A pilgrimage.%} When the great Pāṇḍava-Kaurava
battle started Kṛṣṇa became the charioteer of Arjuna
and Balarāma went to the forest, Naimiśa. He was not
much interested in the battle. At the forest of Naimiṣa
he saw Sūta telling Purāṇic stories to the several sages
assembled there before him. Sūta did not rise up when
he saw Balarāma and the latter moved to anger very
soon cut off the head of Sūta. The sages assembled there
decried the act of Balarāma and lamented deeply over
the incident. At this Balarāma promised that he would
give birth, from the dead body of Sūta, to one who will
be well versed in all the Vedas, śāstras and sciences. The
sages then blessed Balarāma.
<div n="NI"/>During that time there lived in the vicinity of Naimiṣa
forest a demon called Balvala (Vatkala). He used to
annoy the sages there and the sages requested Bala-
rāma to put a stop to the atrocities of that demon. He
immediately killed the demon by his weapon, Hala,
and then raised from the dead body of Sūta a paṇḍita
of great erudition. Later, to remedy the sin of killing
Sūta, Balarāma, repentant, visited all the sacred places
in Bhārata. Once when he heard about the grim battle
between Duryodhana and Bhīmasena, he went to the
battle-field and tried his best to stop the war. Dis-
appointed he returned to Dvārakā. (Daśama Skandha,
Chapter 79, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Death.%} Once the ṛṣis Nārada, Kaṇva and Viśvā-
mitra came to Dvārakā. To make fun of them some of
the Yādavas dressed a Yādava like a pregnant woman
and producing her before the sages asked them what
child she would deliver. Enraged at this the munis
said in one voice that she would deliver a mace and that
iron mace would be the cause of the end of all
Yādavas.
<div n="NI"/>After the Mahābhārata battle the Yādava dynasty re-
mained alive only for thirtysix years. After that by
the curse of the brahmin the Yādavas were all killed in
a drunken brawl between themselves in the very pre-
sence of Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadra. This happened on the
shore of Prabhāsa tīrtha and Balarāma was sitting
there then in deep meditation. Suddenly the soul of
Balarāma went out from his mouth in the shape of a
white serpent and the serpent entering the nether world
was given a warm welcome by the prominent serpents
there. (Mausala Parva, M.B.).
