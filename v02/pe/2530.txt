GUṆAKEŚĪ¦. Daughter of Mātali, charioteer of Indra.
She was more beautiful and well-behaved than many
other girls. Mātali went about in search of a suitable
husband for her in all the three worlds. At last he
met Nārada going to the presence of Kubera. He told
Nārada about this and Nārada took Mātali to Pātālaloka
to search for a suitable bridegroom. Then they found out
a serpent boy named Sumukha (good looking) worthy
of his name who was the grandson of Āryaka and son
of Cikura born of the family of Airāvata. But Sumu-
kha was in danger at that time. Garuḍa had taken a
vow that he would eat Sumukha the next month. Āryaka
told Nārada about this. Nārada took Sumukha to the
court of Indra. Mahāviṣṇu was also present there. When
Nārada told the story there Indra blessed Sumukha and
granted him long life. This made Garuḍa angry and he
went to the court of Indra and rebuked Indra. Mahā-
viṣṇu who was present there then did not like this act of
Garuḍa and he called the latter to his side and asked
him whether he could bear the weight of one of his
arms. With arrogance Garuḍa said ‘yes’ and Viṣṇu
then placed one of his arms on the shoulder of Garuḍa
But Garuḍa found the weight unbearable and begged
pardon of Viṣṇu, bereft of all his arrogance. The
marriage of Sumukha with Guṇakeśī was then conduct-
ed. (Chapters 97 to 105. Udyoga Parva.)
<div n="NI"/>GUṆAMUKHYĀ. A celestial maiden who took part
in the birthday celebrations of Arjuna. She gave a
dance there then. (Śloka 61, Chapter 122, Ādi Parva).
