SANYĀSA¦ (SANNYĀSA) One of the four stages of
Brahminical life. The four stages are Brahmacarya
(Religious student), Gārhasthya (householder), Vāna-
prastha (Forest-dweller) and Sannyāsa (hermit or sage).
(For further details see under Āśrama).
<div n="NI"/>{%Duties of a hermit.%} Manu has ordained that one should
perform sannyāsa (renunciation) at the fourth stage of
life renouncing every tie with the world. After becoming
a hermit he should travel daily alone. He should enter
villages only for food. He should have renounced
wealth. He should not acquire any wealth. He should
be a sage filled with knowledge. He should have a
skull as the pot for taking alms. He should sleep under
trees. He should wear poor cloth and should be solitary.
He should consider everybody as equal. Having become
a hermit he should not delight in death or life.
<div n="NI"/>A hermit should put every step looking straight down to
the earth. He should drink water filtered by cloth.
Words and deeds should be pure and true. The shells
of water-gourd (pumpkin), wooden pots and earthen
pots are the Vaiṣṇava sign of hermits. A hermit should
beg for food daily from houses where no smoke comes
out, where pestle is placed and where there is no char-
coal, and after all have taken food and the pot for pre-
paring food is placed upside down.
<div n="NI"/>It is said that the food got by hermits by begging is of
five types. They are Mādhūkara (collected alms),
asaṃkḷpta (unlimited), Prākpraṇīta (prepared much
earlier), Ayācitam (got by not begging) and tātkālika
(for the time being). In whichever stage of life he
may be, he should be staunch in that stage and should
perform the duties with honesty.
<div n="NI"/>If by ignorance a hermit engaged himself in killing
animals by day or night, to remove the impurity and get
purity, he should bathe and perform six prāṇāyāmas
(restraints of the breath) daily. The hermit should
discard his body made of five elements.
<div n="NI"/>The signs of duty are, resolution, forbearance, selfres-
traint, not robbing, cleansing, control of sense-organs,
modesty, knowledge, truth, not resorting to anger, and
so on. Hermits are of four grades, such as Kuṭīcaka,
Bahūdaka, Haṃsa and Paramahaṃsa, the last-mentioned
being the noblest grade. The hermit who wears one or
three daṇḍas (rod) will be freed from ties of birth and
death.
<div n="NI"/>The five Yamas or restraints are not killing (Ahiṃsā),
truth, not stealing, celibacy and not receiving. The
five Niyamas or religious duties are cleansing, joy or
contentedness, penance, self-study and meditation on
God. The sitting postures suitable for hermits are
Padmāsana etc. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 161).
