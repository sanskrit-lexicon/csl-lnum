UPAŚRUTI¦. The patron-goddess of Uttarāyaṇa (The
sun's progress towards North in the former half of the
year). In Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 166
mention is made of how this goddess made it possible
for Indrāṇī to see Indra through the holes of a stalk of
lotus. It was by the help of Upaśruti that Śacīdevī and
Indra met together. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter
14, Stanzas 12 and 13).
