ARUṆA VI¦. A Dānava (Asura) born in the dynasty of
Vipracitti. He did tapas for long years repeating the
Gāyatrī mantra, and got from Brahmā the boon not to
die in war. Becoming very arrogant on account of this
boon he left Pātāla (nether region) for the earth and
deputed a messenger to challenge Indra for war. At that
time a heavenly voice called out that as long as Aruṇa
did not give up the Gāyatrī he could not be worsted in
war. Then the Devas sent Bṛhaspati to Aruṇa to make
him give up Gāyatrī. Aruṇa questioned Bṛhaspati as to
why he of the enemy camp had come to him (Aruṇa).
Bṛhaspati replied: “You and I are not different; both
of us are worshippers of Gāyatrī Devī. Being told so
Aruṇa gave up worship of Gāyatrī Devī, and she felt
offended at this and sent thousands of beetles against
him. Thus, without fighting Aruṇa and his army were
extinguished. (Devī Bhāgavata).
