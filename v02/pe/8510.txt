VIṢṆUVRATA¦. A Vrata (fast or vow) taken thinking
of Viṣṇu in mind. By taking this vow, one could get
what one desires for.

of the vow of four days, beginning with the second day
of the bright lunar fortnight in the month of Pauṣa,
with mustard; on the next day with gingelly seeds; on
the third day with Orris root and on the fourth day
with all the medicinal herbs. ‘All the medicinal herbs’,
means medicine such as Māñcī, Oris root, Costus,
Bitumen (stone juice), Saffron, Curcuma, bulb of

Cyperus grass. After bathing the image as given above,
Viṣṇu must be exalted on the first day by the name
Kṛṣṇa, on the second day by the name Acyuta, on the
third day, by the name Ananta and on the fourth day,
by the name Hṛṣīkeśa. The worship should be perform-
ed by offering flower, on the feet on the first day, on
the navel on the second day, on the eyes on the third
day and on the head on the fourth day, and Candra
should be given oblations and exalted by names such
as Śaśī on the first day, Candra on the second
day, Śaśāṅka on the third day and Indu on the fourth
day. It is ordained in Chapter 177, of Agni Purāṇa,
that the worship of Viṣṇuvrata should be conducted in
this way. This is a form of worship observed by Kings,
women and Devas (gods).
