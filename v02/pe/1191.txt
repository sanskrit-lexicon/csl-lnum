BHŪLIṄGA¦(M). A bird which lived on the opposite
side of the Himālayas. The cry of this bird resembles
“MĀ SĀHASA”.
<F>1) Mā Sāhasa = Do not act rashly.</F> But this bird lived by pecking at
and eating the flesh between the teeth of a lion. Śiśupāla
mentioned this bird as an example to illustrate that
Bhīṣma's advice was at variance with his practice.
The bird exhorts people not to act in a rash way (Mā
Sāhasa) and at the same time acts rashly.
