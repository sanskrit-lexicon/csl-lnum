BHADRASĀRA¦. A king in the region of Kāśmīra. His
only son, Sudharman, was very much devoted to Śiva
and spent most of his time worshipping him. The
father tried his best to withdraw his son from this ex-
cessive devotion but failed.
<div n="NI"/>Then one day the great sage, Parāśara, came to the
King as his guest and the King then requested him to
make his son withdraw from his Śiva-worship. But
Parāśara then told him about the previous life of
Sudharmā and consoling him persuaded the King to do
the ‘Rudrābhiṣeka’ (uninterrupted pouring of cold
water over an idol of Śiva) by himself. The king then
entrusted the state with his son and left for the forests
accepting an ascetic life. (Skandha Purāṇa, 3.3.20-21).
