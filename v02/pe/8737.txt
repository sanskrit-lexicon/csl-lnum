YĀSKA¦. A famous Sanskrit Grammarian of ancient times.
Although the people of India always believed in the
greatness of the Vedas, the Vedas became unintelli-
gible even to scholars owing to changes in language and
differences in grammar. It was Yāska and Sāyaṇa who
saved the country from that plight. Yāska became famous
by composing “Nirukta” (etymology). There is a refer-
ence to this ancient sage in Mahābhārata, Chapter 342,
Verse 72.
