PRIYAVRATA¦. The eldest son of Svāyambhuva Manu.
He had another son named Uttānapāda and three
daughters named Ākūti, Devahūti and Prasūti. The
daughters were married to Ruci, Kardama and Dakṣa
respectively. (8th Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>Priyavrata married Barhiṣmatī daughter of Kardama-
prajāpati. He got of her two daughters named Samrāṭ
and Kukṣi and ten sons named Agnīdhra, Agnibāhu,
Vapuṣmān, Dyutimān, Medhas, Medhātithi, Bhavya,
Savana, Putra and Jyotiṣmān. Of these Jyotiṣmān was
really possessing jyotis (brilliance). All the sons,
Medhas, Agnibāhū and Putra, were interested in the
practice of yoga and were aware of their previous births.
Priyavrata distributed seven islands to seven of his sons
as follows:
<div n="NI"/>Jambūdvīpa to Agnīdhra; Plakṣadvīpa to Medhātithi;
Śālmalīdvīpa to Vapuṣmān; Kuśadvīpa to Jyotiṣmān;
Krauñcadvīpa to Dyutimān; Śākadvīpa to Bhavya;
and Puṣkaradvīpa to Savana.
<div n="NI"/>Agnīdhra had nine sons named Nābhi, Kimpuruṣa,
Harivarṣa, Ilāvṛta, Ramya, Hiraṇvān, Kuru, Bhadrāśva
and Ketumāla. (Chapter 1, Aṃśa 2, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>Priyavrata once circled round Meru in his chariot. As
if competing with the Sun Priyavrata started his circling
along with sunrise and ended it at sunset. He did so
seven days making nights look like day and the sun
appear dim and faded. The Sun was dejected and it
was at the request of the Trimūrtis that Priyavrata
stopped his circumambulation. It was the path of Priya-
vrata's circling for seven days that later became the seven
oceans of Purāṇic fame. (Yuddha Kāṇḍa, Kamba
Rāmāyaṇa).
