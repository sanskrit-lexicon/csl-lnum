ŚVAPHALKA¦. Father of Akrūra. Vṛṣṇi, a Yādava King
had two sons Śvaphalka and Citraka. It was divinely
ordained that there would not be epidemics and drought
in the place where Śvaphalka lived. Once there was no
rain for a period of three years in the land of the King
of Kāśī. So the King of Kāśī took Śvaphalka with him
to his country. With his arrival there was rainfall in
the land and the King who was pleased at it gave his
daughter Gāndinī in marriage to Śvaphalka.
<div n="NI"/>There is a story about the birth of Gāndinī also.
Gāndinī remained in her mother's womb for many
years. At last the King of Kāśī called to the child
in the womb and said, “Take birth at once; why do
you remain there so long?” The child replied, “I shall
come out if you allow me to offer a cow as gift every
day.” The King allowed it and the child was born.
She was named “Gāndinī.” She used to offer the gift of
cows to Brāhmaṇas daily. After she married Śvaphalka,
several sons including Akrūra were born to her,
(Harivaṃśa, Chapter 34, Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
