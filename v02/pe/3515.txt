KHAṆḌAPARAŚU¦. Śiva. A story occurs in Mahā-
bhārata stating how Śiva got this name. The famous
Dakṣa-yāga (sacrifice performed by Dakṣa) was perform-
ed at a time when the Nara Nārāyaṇas were engaged in
penance in Badaryāśrama. Dakṣa did not invite his son-
in-law Śiva. The angry Śiva sent his trident against
Dakṣa. The trident destroyed the sacrifice of Dakṣa and
then flew against the breast of Nārāyaṇa who was
sitting in penance in Badaryāśrama. By the power of
the trident the hair of Nārāyaṇa became of muñja (a
grass) colour. From that day onwards Nārāyaṇa came
to be known by the name Muñjakeśa. By a sound
“hum”, the hermit Nārāyaṇa deviated the trident,
which reached the hands of Śiva, who got angry and
approached Nārāyaṇa to kill him. Nara, who was close
by took an arrow and reciting spells over it, released it
to kill Śiva. Immediately the arrow changed to an axe.
Śiva broke the axe. After this the axe became the
weapon of Śiva. In Mahābhārata Śānti Parva, Chapter
49, Stanza 33, it is mentioned that this axe was given
to Paraśurāma the disciple of Śiva. Thenceforward
Śiva got the name Khaṇḍaparaśu. (Paraśu means
axe). (Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, Chapter 343. Stan-
zas 150-59, 167).
