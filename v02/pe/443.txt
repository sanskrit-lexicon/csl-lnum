ARJUNAKA¦. A hunter. Dharmaputra was called to his
side by Bhīṣma his body torn by arrows in fight and he
felt very sad and sorry to see Bhīṣma in that state. To
console Dharmaputra Bhīṣma related a story and this
hunter was one of the characters in the story. The story
may be summarised as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Once, the son of an old Brahmin woman Gautamī,
died on account of snake-bite. A hunter caught and
brought before Gautamī the snake. His object was to
kill it immediately. But the serpent proved its innocence
by pleading that it bit the boy impelled and prompted
by Death. At once death (mṛtyu) appeared on the
scene and explained that it was prompted by the God
of Death. And, it was the child who was responsible for
the cause of death, and Gautamī was the cause for the
birth of the child. Ultimately Gautamī herself assumed
responsibility for the sin. Bhīṣma consoled Dharma-
putra by telling that as in the case of Gautamī in
the story, the cause for every effect was the chain
of Karma. (M.B., Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 1).
