KĀLARĀTRI¦. The Devatā presiding over the night on
the eve of death. The fierce aspect of the Devatā is
described in the Mahābhārata as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Coal-black in colour, with swollen mouth and eyes
and wearing red garlands and clothings—thus appeared
the woman (Devatā) presiding over the death-night.
With the fierce cord in her hand she drags away the
souls of the dead. (Sauptika Parva, Chapter 9).
