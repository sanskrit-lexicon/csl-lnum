MAṄKI I¦. A great sage. It was Bhīṣma, while he was
lying on his bed of arrows who narrated the story of
this sage. Maṅki was an aspirant of worldly things and
once he got two bullocks. He was ploughing with them
one day when a camel came and carried them away.
Disappointed he came to the āśrama and lamented
deeply over it. This lamentation became known later
as the famous Maṅkigītā. By the time the gītā reached
its end the mind of the sage was changed and he became
one bereft of all worldly desires and he acquired
mokṣa. (Chapter 177, Śānti Parva).
