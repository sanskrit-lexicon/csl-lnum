DHARMARĀJA¦. A king of Gauḍadeśa. He became
King at a time when Jainism was getting more and
more hold on the people and the Hindu Vedic rites
were getting less and less popular among the people.
The King thought it was his duty to revive the interest
in the Vedic rites and so became a priest himself
and did much propaganda on the superiority of the
same, writing several books on the subject for the benefit
of the people. (Bhaviṣyapurāṇa, Pratisarga Parva).
