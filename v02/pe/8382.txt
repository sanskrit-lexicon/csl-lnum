VIPĀŚĀ¦. A Purāṇically famous river in the region of
five rivers (Punjab). Vasiṣṭha was stricken with grief
at the death of his son Śakti and jumped into this river
with the help of a rope to commit suicide. The waves
of the river united the knots of the rope and saved him.
From that day onwards this river came to be known as
Vipāśā. (See under Kalmāṣapāda) Other information
about this river given in the Purāṇas is given below:—
<div n="NI"/>(i) Vipāśā stays in the palace of Varuṇa serving him.
(M.B. Chapter 9, Stanza 19).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Two devils named Bahi and Hīka live in this river.
