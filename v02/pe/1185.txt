BHṚŚUṆḌI¦. A fisherman. He used to earn his living
by theft.
<div n="NI"/>Once when the Mahaṛṣi Mudgala was passing through
a forest, Bhṛśuṇḍi stopped him. But in the presence of
the Brahmanic effulgence of the Mahaṛṣi, the fisherman
was dazed. Mudgala took pity on Bhṛśuṇḍi and advised
him to worship Lord Gaṇeśa.
<div n="NI"/>From that time Bhṛśuṇḍi gave up his evil ways, and
accepting the advice of Mudgala, started the worship
of Gaṇeśa with single-minded devotion. As a result
of it, an elephant's trunk began to grow from the middle
of his forehead. Bhṛśuṇḍi who thus acquired a shape
closely resembling Gaṇeśa, was visited by Indra, mis-
taking him for Gaṇapati. (Gaṇeśa: 1.67).
