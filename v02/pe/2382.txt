GAUTAMA IV¦. Another ascetic of great virtue. Once
when this Gautama was going through the forest he
saw an elephant babe lying wearied. He took it to his
āśrama and brought it up. When it became a full
grown elephant Indra disguised as the emperor
Dhṛtarāṣṭra came to take it away secretly. Gautama
found it out and then he was offered thousand cows
and much wealth in lieu of the elephant. But Gautama
refused to part with the elephant. Pleased with his
extreme affection for his dependant, Indra took both
Gautama and the elephant to heaven. (Chapter 102,
Anuśāsana Parva).
