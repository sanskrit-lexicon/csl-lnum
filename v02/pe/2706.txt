HOMAKUṆḌA¦(M). The pit for making offerings
during yajñas. Rules about making the pit are describ-
ed in chapter 24 of the Agni Purāṇa as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>First, demarcate a piece of ground one yard square with
thread and dig it one yard deep. After leaving two aṃgulas
(inches) space on all the four sides of the pit make three
divisions in it. The three divisions should be 12”×8” and
4” deep; the inner division 12” deep, the middle one 8”
and the one outside of it 4” deep. All the three divi-
sions should be four feet in width. The above three
divisions are called Satvamekhalā, Rajomekhala and
Tāmasamekhalā, and this is the pit, viz. Homakuṇḍa.
On the western side of it a yoni (receptacle) 10×15
aṃgulas should be made. Its depth should gradually
decrease in the descending order 6, 4, 2 aṃgulas. In
shape the yoni will be of the shape of the peepal leaf.
(Yoni is that of Śakti; the Kuṇḍa is her stomach. The
conception about Śakti is that of a woman lying on
her back, head towards the east.). The priest performs
the rites, himself seated to the west of the yoni and his
head turned to the east.
