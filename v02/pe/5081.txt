PARVATEŚVARA¦. A King of Vindhyadeśa. He
tortured his people because of his greed for money and
Yama sent him to hell when he died. In his next birth
he was born as a monkey. At that time a priest of the
King had taken life as a Sārasa bird. One day the
monkey tried to catch the bird and then the bird
(priest) reminded him of his previous birth and told
him that in their next birth both of them would be
swans and in the birth after that they would become
men again. (Uttara Khaṇḍa, Padma Purāṇa).
