<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Aṅga, Kaliṅga, Suhma, Kaṇḍra, Vaṅga,
Adrupa and Anaśābhu are the seven sons born to Bali,
the son of Sutapas, by his wife Suteṣṇā, and the King
Aṅga is one of them. There is a story about the birth
of these sons.
<div n="NI"/>Once there lived a hermit named Utatthya. He was
the elder brother of Bṛhaspati. One day when Mamatā,
Utatthya's wife, was pregnant, Bṛhaspati approached
her with carnal desires. In spite of her efforts to dis-
suade her brother-in-law from his attempts she could not
prevail upon him. He forced her and satisfied his desire.
The child in her womb protested and kicked the sperm
of Bṛhaspati out into the floor. Bṛhaspati got angry and
cursed the child in the womb: “May you fall in perpe-
tual darkness”. So the child was born blind and
remained blind throughout his life. Hence he got the
name ‘Dīrghatamas’. Dīrghatamas married Pradveṣi. A
son named Gautama was born to them. The duty of
supporting Dīrghatamas fell upon the wife and the son,
who put him on a raft and pushed him astray into the
River Ganges. King Bali, who was bathing in the river
saw this. He rescued the hermit and took him to the
palace and pleasing him by hospitality, requested him
to beget children in his wife Suteṣṇā, who detesting the
idea sent a Śūdrā woman Dhātreyī in her stead and
eleven children were born to them. By and by Dīrgha-
tamas came to know of the deceit played by Suteṣṇā on
him and he became very angry. But the King pacified
him and pleased him again and Dīrghatamas begot five
sons by Suteṣṇā. They were Aṅga, Vaṅga, Kaliṅga,
Pauṇḍra and Suhma. Dīrghatamas blessed them that they
would become very famous. Aṅga, Vaṅga, Kaliṅga,
Pauṇḍra and Suhma were the five kingdoms ruled by
Aṅga, Vaṅga, Kaliṅga, Pauṇḍra and Suhma respectively.
These five are the famous Kings of the Bāli family.
(Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 104).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%How Aṅga got children.%} Once Aṅga performed a
horse sacrifice. But the gods did not appear to receive
[Page037-b+ 64]
oblations. Holy seers said that the Gods refused to
accept the oblations offered by the King because he was
childless. So he performed the sacrifice called Putrakā-
meṣṭi (Sacrifice to get a son) and from the sacrificial
fire arose a divine person with a golden flask of pud-
ding, which he offered to the King and his queen. The
King and the queen Sunīthā ate the pudding, as a
result of which a son was born to them. He was named
Vena. This son was wicked. Because of his wickedness
the King became so miserable that he left his kingdom
and went on a pilgrimage. Since there was no other
means the people enthroned Vena, who tortured his
subjects beyond limit. (Bhāgavata, 4th Skandha, Chap-
ters Band 14).
