JĀBĀLI III¦. A hermit. The descendants of this hermit
also are known by this name. Jābāli who performed
penance on the mountain of Mandara had several disci-
ples.
<div n="NI"/>While Jābāli was going along the forest he saw a young
man of handsome appearance engaged in penance on
the shore of a lake. Jābāli wanted to know about him
and his penance. But as the young man was in deep
meditation Jābāli had to wait there for several years.
At last the young man awoke from his meditation and
told Jābāli the secrets of devotional meditation and con-
templation of Kṛṣṇa. The remaining life of Jābāli was
spent in the worship of Kṛṣṇa, in consequence of which
in the next birth he was reborn as a cowherdess,
named Citragandhā in the house of the cowherd Pra-
caṇḍa. (Padma Purāṇa, Pātāla Khaṇḍa, Chapters
30, 72 and 109).
