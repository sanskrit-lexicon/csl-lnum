VĀSTUPURUṢA¦. In days of yore a ghost of immense
size, who was feared by all other ghosts came into
existence. This ghost was buried inside the earth by
the Devas. This ghost is called Vāstupuruṣa. He is
the deity of whatever we build on the earth. The
offering made to this Vāstupuruṣa on completion of a
house is called “Puravāstubali”. (Agni Purāṇa, Chap-
ter 40).
