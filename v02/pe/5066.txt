PARṆAŚĀLĀ¦. A Village situated in the valley of the
mountain Yāmuna. This mountain stands between the
rivers Gaṅgā and Yamunā. During the period of
Mahābhārata this village was the abode of a great
number of eminent scholars. Once there lived in that
village a brahmin of Agastyagotra, well-learned, named
Śarmī. One day the messengers of Kāla (god of death)
came to that village and by mistake took Śarmī to
Yamaloka. It was only when they reached there that
they understood their folly and Kāla then asked his
men to carry him back to earth. Then Śarmī said he
would spend the balance of life due to him in Yama-
loka itself. But Yama did not allow that. Kāla then
told Śarmī the greatness in giving as gifts Til and
Vastra (Gingelly and clothes) and sent him back to
earth. (Chapter 68, Anuśāsana Parva).
