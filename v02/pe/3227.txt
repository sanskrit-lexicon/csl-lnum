KANAKHALA II¦. A holy place on the shores of the
river Gaṅgā. If one bathes in this river one gets the

benefit of performing an Aśvamedha sacrifice. (Śloka
30, Chapter 84, Vana Parva). Kālidāsa speaks about
this place in his famous work ‘Meghadūta’. At the
behest of Vasiṣṭha, Takṣaka, son of Lakṣmana, conquer-
ed the foresters of Kanakhala and then established a
city there called Agatī. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
