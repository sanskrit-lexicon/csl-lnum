ARTHAM¦. From the forehead of Mahāviṣṇu a golden
lotus grew up from which Śrī Devī was born. Dharm-
ārthas (Dharma=righteousness and artha=wealth) also
were born from Śrī. “From the forehead of Viṣṇu,
sprung up a golden lotus and His wise spouse Śrī arose
there from and oh, Pāṇḍava, righteousness and wealth
came into being from Śrī”. (Bhāṣābhārata, Śānti Parva,
Chapter 59, Stanzas 130 & 131).
