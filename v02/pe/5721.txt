ṚBHU I¦. An ancient sage. He was the son of Brahmā.
He was an extraordinary scholar who became the
preceptor of Nidāgha who was the son of Pulastya and
the grandson of Brahmā. Ṛbhu conveyed all know-
ledge to Nidāgha. But he saw that although he taught
Nidāgha all branches of knowledge, the latter did
not take any interest in “Advaita”. So he left him
in disappointment but later got him interested in
Advaita. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 2. Chapters 15-16).
