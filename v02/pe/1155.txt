<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth and Boyhood.%} Bhīṣma's name in his boyhood was
Devavrata. He was the eighth son of Śantanu, a king
of the lunar dynasty and Gaṅgādevī. This boy was the
human embodiment of Dyau, one of the Aṣṭavasus.
Śantanu, his father was the re-birth of another king,
Mahābhiṣeka. The story concerning this, as given in
the Mahābhārata is as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>King Mahābhiṣeka after his death, attained Viṣṇuloka.
Once he went to visit Brahmā at Satyaloka. At that
time Gaṅgādevī was also present in Brahmā's assembly.
In that pious atmosphere, a gentle breeze began to blow
and Gaṅgādevī's clothes were slightly deranged. Just
at that moment, Mahābhiṣeka took a stealthy glance at
her and she also returned that glance. This was noted
by Brahmā who turned both of them into human beings
by a curse. Gaṅgādevi begged pardon and Brahmā
lifted the curse and blessed her that the Aṣṭavasus would
come to the earth to be born as her sons and that after-
wards she could come back to Heaven. After that
Gaṅgādevī was born as a mortal woman in the world
under the name Gaṅgā and she spent her days in the
forests near the Gaṅgā river valleys.
<div n="NI"/>In those days the ruler of the Lunar dynasty was a king
named Pratīpa. Having no children, he went to the
bank of the river Gaṅgā and performed tapas there.
Gaṅgādevī who was moving about in the forests near-
by, saw the King deeply absorbed in his tapas. She
approached him and sat on his right thigh. She wanted
the King to be her husband. He explained to her that
the right thigh is the proper seat of a daughter-in-law
[Page135-a+ 65]
and so she would become his son's wife in due course.
In course of time, Pratīpa had a son, Śantanu, born
to him. When Śantanu grew up into a young man, one
day he went for a hunt to the Gaṅgā-valley and there he
met Gaṅgādevī. He fell in love with her at first sight
and courted her. Gaṅgādevī agreed to become his wife
on condition that he should not say anything to displease
her and if he violated that condition she would leave him.
The king accepted the condition and they became man
and wife.
<div n="NI"/>At about that time, the wife of Dyo, one of the Aṣṭa-
vasus, happened to see the sacrificial cow of the sage
Vasiṣṭha and wished to have it. She expressed her
desire to her husband, Dyo. Dyo, with the other seven
vasus went and took away by force, Vasiṣṭha's cow.
Vasiṣṭha in his anger cursed the Aṣṭavasus to be born as
mortals. They repented and begged pardon from
Vasiṣṭha. The sage told them that all of them would
be born as the sons of Gaṅgādevī and all except Dyo,
who actually stole the cow, would return to Heaven
at the time of birth itself. As for Dyo, he would continue
to live in the world for a long time, as an adventurous
hero.
<div n="NI"/>Gaṅgādevī became pregnant and gave birth to her first
child. She carried the child to the river Gaṅgā and
threw it into the river. Śantanu who followed her up
to the river bank, did not say anything against her,
remembering his promise.
<div n="NI"/>Seven children were born to her and she threw all of them
into the river in this way. When she gave birth to the
eighth child, Śantanu insisted that he would not allow
her to throw away that child into the river. As he had
violated the condition, the angry Gaṅgādevī left the
palace with her child. She named it Devavrata and
brought him up in the forest. The sage Vasiṣṭha and
Gaṅgādevī taught him all branches of knowledge.
Thirtytwo years later, the king went to the same forest
for hunting. He saw a handsome boy stopping the
flow of the river Gaṅgā. Getting interested in the boy,
the King approached him. But by that time he had
disappeared. The King prayed to Gaṅgādevī to give
back the child. She appeared with the child and after
handing over the child to him vanished. The king
returned to the palace with the child. (M.B. Ādi
Parva, Chapters 95-100).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The name Bhīṣma.%} Devavrata was anointed, as
heir-apparent. One day King Śantanu reached the
forest near the Gaṅgā river valley, for hunting. As he
was hunting, absorbed in the beauty of the forest scenery,
he felt the perfume of musk filling the air in the forest.
He wondered from where it could come. He went on
and on trying to find out the source of this smell until
he reached the cottage of a fisherman. The fisherman
had a daughter named Satyavatī. It was from her that
the fragrance of musk spread all around.
<F>1) Satyavatī's original name was Kālī. The fisherman got her from the stomach of a fish. (See the word Adrikā). Since she
had the smell of fish she got the name of “Matsyagandhī.” She used to assist a fisherman in his work as a ferryman in the river Gaṅgā.
Once the sage Parāśara happened to get into her boat and he fell deeply in love with her. The sage removed the smell of fish from her and gave
her the perfume of musk instead. By this mystic power he created a mist at noon and under its cover, he had a sexual union with her. As
a result of it the child Kṛṣṇa (Vyāsa) was born. The child immediately left the mother to perform tapas in the forest after promising to
return to her whenever she wished for his presence. Although she gave birth to a child, Parāśara blessed that she would again remain a
virgin. The whole episode remained a secret. As usual, Satyavatī returned to the fisherman's cottage in the evening and continued to
live with him. It is at this stage that Śantanu was attracted by the perfume of musk and came to the cottage where he met Satyavatī.</F> The king
fell in love with her at first sight. He asked the fisherman
to give the girl in marriage to him. But the brave fisher-
[Page135-b+ 57]
man did not yield to the king's demand immediately.
He laid down several conditions, one of which was that
Satyavatī's sons should succeed to the throne of Śantanu.
The king was in a fix. Devavrata was the eldest son and
heir-apparent. To deny kingship to his sons would be
highly improper. Unable to find a solution to this diffi-
cult problem, the king returned to the palace, much
depressed and gloomy. There he avoided all company
and took to his bed, passing his time in sadness and
solitude.
<div n="NI"/>When Devavrata knew about his father's condition, he
called the Ministers and asked them about it. They
told him everything in details. At once, without inform-
ing even his father, Devavrata went to the fisherman's
cottage on the bank of the river Gaṅgā and begged for
Satyavatī on behalf of his father. The fisherman repeated
his former condition. Devavrata agreed that Satya-
vatī's son shall be given the right of Kingship. The
fisherman pointed out that disputes were likely to arise
between Devavrata's sons and Satyavatī's children regar-
ding the right of succession to the throne. At once
Devavrata stood up and made a solemn pledge that he
would remain a bachelor for life. The fisherman gave
Satyavatī to Devavrata to be taken to the King. Deva-
vrata took her to the palace and presented her to his
father. The King, when he came to know of the part
played by his son in the matter, rose from his bed and
embraced Devavrata with tears of joy and gratitude.
The gods showered flowers on the scene. Because he had
taken such a solemn oath, it was declared that hence-
forth he would be known by the name “BHĪṢMA”.
The loving father Śantanu also gave him a boon that
Bhīṣma would die only when he wished. (M.B., Ādi
Parva, Chapter 100).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Affairs of the Kingdom in crisis.%} Two sons named
Vicitravīrya and Citrāṅgada were born to Satyavatī by
Śantanu, who died shortly afterwards. As desired by
Satyavatī, Bhīṣma crowned the boy Citrāṅgada as king.
Although Citrāṅgada's reign was a prosperous one, it
could not last long. Once a Gandharva named Citrāṅ-
gada attacked him at Kurukṣetra and after a battle
which lasted for three years, the Gandharva Citrāṅgada
killed the King Citrāṅgada. It was Bhīṣma who per-
formed the funeral rites of the King Citrāṅgada. After
that Vicitravīrya was crowned King.
<div n="NI"/>It was at that time that the Svayaṃvara of the three
daughters of the King of Kāśī, Aṃbā, Aṃbikā and
Aṃbālikā, was held. Bhīṣma thought that it would be
good if Vicitravīrya married them. So Bhīṣma attended
that function. The presence of Bhīṣma who was an old
man, at the Svayaṃvara, frightened the girls. The other
kings who were present, stopped him from entering
the place, since he had taken an oath to remain a life-
long bachelor. The old Bhīṣma stood up and spoke at
length about the eight different forms of marriage and
after defeating several kings like Śālva, he seized the
three daughters of the King of Kāśi and took them with
[Page136-a+ 65]
him in his chariot to Hastināpura. Preparations were
made for the marriage of Vicitravīrya with the three
princesses. Then Ambā approached Bhīṣma and told
him that she had already dedicated her heart to the king
of Śālva. Bhīṣma generously allowed her to return home.
(For the rest of Ambā's story, see the word “Ambā”.
<div n="NI"/>Vicitravīrya married Ambikā and Ambālikā. He ruled
over the country for seven years at the end of which he
died of consumption. The dynasty faced a crisis, as
there was no one to succeed him. Satyavatī approached
Bhīṣma with a suggestion to beget children by Vicitra-
vīrya's wife. But Bhīṣma stood firmly on his solemn oath
to continue as a life-long bachelor. (M.B. Ādi Parva,
Verse 100-104).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Bhīṣma's Wire Pulling.%} After that Satyavatī sum-
moned Vyāsa to Hastināpura and sons were born
to Ambikā, Ambālikā and their maid by him. Ambikā
gave birth to Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Ambālikā gave birth to
Pāṇḍu and the maid gave birth to Vidura. They grew
up and Dhṛtarāṣṭra married Gāndhārī and Pāṇḍu
married Kuntī and Mādrī. Duryodhana and his brothers
were born to Dhṛtarāṣṭra, while the Pāṇḍavas were
born to Pāṇḍu. Pāṇḍu died at the Śataśṛṅga vana and
Mādrī observed satī by jumping into his funeral pyre
and burning herself alive. After that, the Kauravas
and Pāṇḍavas who lived in the palace at Hastināpura,
split up into two blocs. When the palace made of lac
was destroyed by fire, the Pāṇḍavas went into the forest
and came back to the country after their marriage with
Pāñcālī. They ruled over the country with Indraprastha
as their capital. In the gambling contest between
Dharmaputra and Duryodhana, the Pāṇḍavas lost their
kingdom and everything and so they went to the forest
again. They lived for twelve years in the forest and spent
one year incognito in the palace of the King of Virāṭa.
At that time the Pāṇḍavas reappeared in the battle
which took place as a result of the theft of King Virāṭa's
cows by the Kauravas. Duryodhana asserted that he
would not give so much land to the Pāṇḍavas as to put
a dot with a needle. With the failure of Śrī Kṛṣṇa's
mediation, the Kauravas and Pāṇḍavas encamped on
the opposite sides of the field of Kurukṣetra, preparing
for a grim battle.
<div n="NI"/>Bhīṣma was the chief protagonist in all these events
relating to the Kauravas and Pāṇḍavas. At every stage
in the story we see Bhīṣma's influence. The main events
in which this superman who used to give shelter to
Kauravas and Pāṇḍavas alike, played a decisive role,
are given below:—
<div n="NI"/>(1) Bhīṣma sent a messenger to Subala, king of Gān-

<div n="NI"/>(8) He burst into tears and wept bitterly on hearing that
Pāṇḍavas were burnt to death in the palace of lac and
was about to offer them ‘Jalāñjali’. Just then, Vidura
came to him and secretly informed him that the Pāṇḍavas
were not dead. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 149, Dākṣi-
ṇātya Pāṭha).

value and importance of pilgrimage. (Vana Parva,
Chapter 82, Verse 4).
<div n="NI"/>(18) Bhīṣma advised Duryodhana to be on friendly
terms with the Pāṇḍavas. (Vana Parva, Chapter 253,
Verse 4).
<div n="NI"/>(19) In the battle which was fought by Kauravas against
King Virāṭa, Bhīṣma arranged the regiments in order,
after sending Duryodhana to Hastināpura. (Virāṭa
Parva, Chapter 52, Verse 16).
<div n="NI"/>(20) A grim fight took place between Arjuna who went
to help the Virāṭa army and Bhīṣma. At last, it was the
charioteer who removed Bhīṣma, (who had fallen down
unconscious) from the battlefield. (Virāṭa Parva,
Chapter 64).
<div n="NI"/>(21) When the Kauravas were contemplating to fight
against the Pāṇḍavas who had returned after their
incognito life, Bhīṣma ridiculed Karṇa and praised
Arjuna. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 21, Verse 16).
<div n="NI"/>(22) At that time, he explained to Duryodhana, the
greatness of Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna. (Udyoga Parva,
Chapter 49, verse 2).
<div n="NI"/>(23) Duryodhana proposed to bind the hands and feet
of Śrī Kṛṣṇa who was expected to come as the envoy of
the Pāṇḍavas. Hearing this, Bhīṣma in great anger,
walked out of the council hall. (Udyoga Parva, Chap-
ter 88, Verse 19).
<div n="NI"/>(24) Bhīṣma strongly advised Duryodhana to make a
treaty of peace with the Pāṇḍavas. (Udyoga Parva,

<div n="NI"/>(25) He declared that he would not kill the Pāṇḍavas
but would kill 10,000 soldiers of the Pāṇḍavas everyday.
Udyoga Parva, Chapter 156, Verse 21).
[Page137-a+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>(26) As desired by Duryodhana, Bhīṣma declared the
Rathīs and Mahārathīs who belonged to the Kaurava
side. (Udyoga Parva, Chapters 165-168).
<div n="NI"/>(27) Bhīṣma described all the Mahārathīs of the Pāṇḍava
side to Duryodhana. (Udyoga Parva, Chapters 169-
172).
<div n="NI"/>(28) Bhīṣma told Duryodhana that Śikhaṇḍī and the

<div n="NI"/>(29) Bhīṣma offered pūjā to Paraśurāma. (Udyoga Parva,
Chapter 123, Verse 27).
<div n="NI"/>(30) Aṃbā who was allowed by Bhīṣma to marry her
lover, King Śālva, was rejected by him and returned
to Bhīṣma again. But he did not accept her. Although
Paraśurāma pleaded with him on behalf of Aṃbā,
Bhīṣma did not marry her. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter
178, Verse 32).
<div n="NI"/>(31) In connection with Ambā's case, a duel was fought
on the field of Kurukṣetra between Bhīṣma and Paraśu-
rāma. Bhīṣma started the duel after asking for the
permission of Paraśurāma. Pleased with the fight, the
Vasus presented to Bhīṣma, the Prasvāpana arrow. But
he did not use that arrow against Paraśurāma, since
the gods and Nārada prevented him from doing so.
At the request of the gods, pitṛs and Gaṅgādevī, Bhīṣma
stopped the fight and prostrated at the feet of Paraśu-
rāma. (Udyoga Parva, Chapters 178-185).
