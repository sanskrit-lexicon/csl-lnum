SUKEŚA¦ (SUKEŚĪ).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information%} A rākṣasa (giant) who was the
son of Vidyutkeśa and Sālakaṭaṅkā. When Brahmā
asked the Subjects to look after his creation those who
said ‘Rakṣāmahe’ became Rākṣasas (giants) and those
who said ‘Yakṣāmahe’, the Yakṣas (a clan of semi gods).
Once two brothers named Heti and Praheti were born
[Page759-a+ 65]
in the clan of Rākṣasas. Praheti remained unmarried and
entered the life of penance. Heti married Bhayā the sister
of Kāla. A son named Vidyutkeśa was born to the cou-
ple. Vidyutkeśa married Sālakaṭaṅkā, the daughter of
Sandhyā. Sālakaṭaṅkā delivered a son. But wishing
to enjoy the company of her husband, she abandoned
the son and lived with her husband. The child which
was as bright as the rising Sun, putting its folded fist
in its mouth, cried aloud. Paramaśiva and Pārvatī
who were travelling along the sky mounted on the bull,
heard the cry of the infant and looked at the spot from
which the cry arose. On seeing the infant, Pārvatī took
pity on it. Śiva blessed the child, which instantly grew
as old as its mother. Śiva gave the Rākṣasa prince
immortality and a city which could travel through the
sky. Pārvatī said that Rākṣasa women would, in future
deliver the moment they became pregnant and that the
child would grow equal to its mother in age, as soon as
it was born. Sukeśa was the son of Vidyutkeśa and
Sālakaṭaṅkā. Sukeśa was delighted at the boons he
got, and travelled wherever he pleased, in his city.
<div n="NI"/>Sukeśa married Devavatī the daughter of Grāmaṇī a
Gandharva. Mālī, Sumālī and Mālyavān were the
sons of this couple. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The city of Sukeśa fell on the ground.%} Sukeśa pleased
Śiva by penance. Śiva made him invincible and gave
him a city which travelled through the sky. Because of
these boons, the Rākṣasa became righteous and pious.
He lived in the city with other Rākṣasas. Once Sukeśa
went to the forest Māgadha and visited the hermits
there. He asked them about the means to attain pros-
perity in this world and the other worlds. The hermits
gave him long exhortations. They told him about the
various hells given to sinners. Thus Sukeśa became
righteous-minded and saintly. He returned to his
city and called together all the other Rākṣasas and
spoke to them about what he had learned from the
hermits. He said: “The hermits taught me the means
to attain heaven. They are Non-killing, Truth, not
stealing, cleanliness, control of all outward going ener-
gies, liberality, kindness, forgiveness, abstinence, good
usages etc. So it is my order that all of you observe
these good things.” The Rākṣasas were pleased at the
words of Sukeśa. They began to lead a righteous life.
In this way they got wealth and prosperity. Their
radiance increased to such an extent that the Sun and
the moon and the stars found it difficult to continue
their travels.
<div n="NI"/>Thus the city of the Rākṣasa shone as the sun in the day
and as the moon in the night. The progress of the Sun
in the day became indiscernible. Due to its brightness
the Rākṣasa city seemed to be the moon and thinking
that it was night, the lotus flowers folded in the day
and bloomed in the night. Havoc was caused in the
earth as well as in the world of the gods. The sun be-
came unpopular. So he tried to find out the cause. At
last he found out the cause. He became angry. He
looked with fury at the city of the Rākṣasas. Hit by
the look, the city lost its merits and began to sink down
to the earth.
<div n="NI"/>When the city fell down Sukeśa called Śiva and cried
aloud. Śiva looked round to see what happened to his
devotee. He understood that the sun was the culprit.
Śiva looked at the sun with furious eyes. Instantly the
sun was dropped from the Solar region to the air. The
[Page759-b+ 64]
hermits saw the Sun coming slowly to the earth. They
called out loudly. “If you want to be well in falling,
go and fall in Harikṣetra.” The sun called out, “What
is Harikṣetra?” “Harikṣetra is Vārāṇasī from Yogaśāyī
to Keśavadarśana”, the hermits replied. Hearing this
the Sun fell in Vārāṇasī. Then to lessen the heat the
sun dipped and splashed in Asi tīrtha and Varuṇā
tīrtha.
<div n="NI"/>Brahmā knew this, and informed Śiva of it. Śiva came to
Vārāṇasī and took the sun by his hands and gave him the
name ‘Lola’ and sent him back in the chariot. After
that Brahmā went to Sukeśa and sent his city with the
Rākṣasas in it, back to the sky, and the Sun was fixed
in the sky as before. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 15)
