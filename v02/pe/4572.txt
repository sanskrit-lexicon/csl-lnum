and making him a lion posted it to guard the palace-

gates of Mahābali. He said he would be released from
the curse when any man on earth defeated it. Once a
brahmin warrior named Śrīdatta defeated this lion and
at once the lion changed into a Yakṣa and the Yakṣa
presented Śrīdatta with the sword named Mṛgāṅkaka.
