PAÑCACŪḌĀ¦. A nymph. Once Śuka, son of Vyāsa by
his yogic powers entered the Ākāśa. Then a host of
celestial maidens led by Pañcacūḍā stood watching him
in admiration. (See under Śuka)
<div n="NI"/>Bhīṣma once told Dharmaputra that women were fickle-
minded and the cause of evils. To explain his statement
he pointed out to the conversation between Nārada
and Pañcacūḍā. Nārada once conducted a world tour
during the course of which he met Pañcacūḍā and asked
her the characteristics of women. She replied thus:
“Even beautiful, venerable and noble ladies would stoop
to folly. It is not the habit of women to leave away
charming men of wealth if they get them conveniently.
Any woman can be tamed if you please her in the
proper way. If women remain faithful to their husbands
[Page548-a+ 62]
it is because they are afraid of scandal. They will enjoy
men without looking into their age or figure. The desire
for men in women can be compared to that of Antaka
(god of Death) for the lives of men. This is the secret
of womanhood.” (Chapter 38, Anuśāsana Parva).
