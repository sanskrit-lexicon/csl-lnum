ŚATĀNANDA I¦. Priest of King Janaka. He was the
son of Gautama by Ahalyā. (Bhāgavata, 9th Skandha
and Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 278). Śatānanda felt elated
that Śrī Rāma restored to Ahalyā her old sanctity and
also that his father Gautama received back his mother
and lived with her. It was Śatānanda, who acted as
high-priest at the wedding of Sītā with Rāma.
