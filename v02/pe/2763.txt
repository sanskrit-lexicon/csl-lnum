INDRĀṆĪ¦. Wife of Indra (Śacī).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus: Viṣṇu—
Brahmā—Kaśyapa—Pulomā—Śacī (Indrāṇī). Pulomā
was an asura born to Kaśyapa by his wife Danu. Indra
married Śacī, the daughter of Pulomā, and hence Śacī
is called Indrāṇī also. She is called Paulomī also as she
was the daughter of Pulomā.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Indrāṇī and Śūrapadma.%} An Asura called Śūrapadma
once coveted Indrāṇī. He deputed his men to fetch
Śacī somehow or other to him. Hearing about this,
Indra, keeping Indrāṇī with him, went to and stayed in
the Chīyāli temple in Koṅkaṇadeśa, and afterwards
Indra went to Mount Kailāsa after asking Śāstā to
guard Indrāṇī. During Indra's absence Ajāmukhī,
sister of Śūrapadma met Indrāṇī and induced her to
become Śūrapadma's wife. Indrāṇī refused. Ultimately
Indra returned and took Indrāṇī back to Devaloka.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Indrāṇī and Nahuṣa.%} See under Agastya.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Indrāṇī and Pāñcālī.%} Mahābhārata says that Pāñcālī
was a partial incarnation of Indrāṇī. (See under Pāñcālī).
A part of Śacī was born in the family of Drupada as
Draupadī, viz. Pāñcālī. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 67).
<div n="NI"/>(1) Indrāṇī once went to the assembly of Brahmā and
worshipped him. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 11,
Verse 42).
<div n="NI"/>(2) When once Satyabhāmā came to Devaloka with
Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Indrāṇī conducted her to Aditi, mother of the
Devas. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 36).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Śacī also was present at the birth of Subrah-
maṇya. (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 46, Verse 13).
<div n="NI"/>(4) Indrāṇī and Arjuna. (See under Arjuna).
