KUṆḌADHĀRA III¦. A cloud. None of the Devas
condescended to bless a poor brahmin, who once per-
formed penance in the forest when a cloud called Kuṇḍa-
dhāra appeared and told him that, if the Devas would
permit, he (cloud) would bless him. Immediately the
Deva called Māṇibhadra requested the cloud to bless
the brahmin. The cloud did so and the brahmin
attained salvation. (Śānti Parva, Chapter 271).
