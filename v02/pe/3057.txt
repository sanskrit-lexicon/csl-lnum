area of eighteen thousand nāzhikas (Indian mile of (1/4)
Kośa) and a height of two thousand nāzhikas. On the
[Page365-a+ 65]
eastern side of this mount there are two mountains
called Jaṭhara and Devakūṭa. Pavamāna and Pāriyātra
are the two mountains on the western side. On the
south there are the two mountains of Kailāsa and
Karavīra. The two mountains on the north are called
Triśṛṅga and Makaragiri. It is stated in Mahābhārata,
Vana Parva, Chapters 109 and 141 that the abodes of
Śiva and Kubera are on the mount Kailāsa. Once, to
please Śiva, Mahāviṣṇu performed penance on Kailāsa.
(M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 222, Stanzas 33 to 40). It
is mentioned in Mahā Bhārata, Sabhā Parva, Chapter
3 that the mountain Maināka stands to the north of
Kailāsa. Once Vyāsa went to Kailāsa. (M.B. Sabhā
Parva, Chapter 43, Stanza 17). In Vana Parva,
Chapter 106, mention is made that the King Sagara,
with his two queens, once went to Kailāsa for penance.
It was on the Kailāsa that Bhagīratha performed
penance to propitiate Śiva to bring down Gaṅgā.
Kailāsa is hundred yojanas high. The devas come to
this place daily and return. It is mentioned in Sabhā
Parva, Chapter 141, that in the place where Kubera
lives on Kailāsa there live a large number of Yakṣas
(demi-gods), Rākṣasas (giants) Kinnaras (heavenly
musicians), Garuḍas (hawks) Mātaṅgas (elephants)
and Gandharvas (semi-gods). The lake of lotus of
Kubera which was reached by Bhīmasena once, was in
Kailāsa. In Vana Parva, it is mentioned that the
Pāṇḍavas visited Kailāsa during their forest life. It
could be understood from Mahābhārata, Anuśāsana
Parva, Chapter 83 that Kāmadhenu performed penance
on the Kailāsa, once.
