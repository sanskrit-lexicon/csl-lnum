NANDAGOPA¦. Foster-father of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Previous birth.%} There are two stories about the
previous birth of Nandagopa.
<div n="NI"/>(i) Droṇa, one of the eight Vasus and his wife Dhārā
once committed a mistake, not becoming the gods.
Brahmā who found it out, cursed the couple to take
birth in the family of cowherds. Droṇa and Dhārā
prayed for remission. Brahmā told them that Mahā-
viṣṇu would incarnate as their son as Śrī Kṛṣṇa and
that after that birth they would be liberated from the
curse. Accordingly Droṇa took birth as Nandagopa and
Dhārā as Yaśodā. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 10).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Once a King named Candrasena sat in the Mahā-
kāla temple in Ujjayinī to perform penance. Śiva was
pleased at his penance and gave him a jewel. That
brilliant precious stone fulfilled all his desires. Other
kings heard about this jewel and came to war to take
possession of the jewel. The King came and took
refuge in the temple.
<div n="NI"/>At this time a son named Śrīkara was born to a cow-
herdess in Ujjayinī. He was god-fearing since childhood.
Śrīkara came to Mahākāla temple and sat in worship
and meditation and attained the goodwill of Śiva. The
Kings who came in chase of Candrasena could not
approach the temple because of the unearthly brilliance
that radiated from Śrīkara. Not knowing the reason the
kings stood staring and Hanūmān instantly appeared
before them and said. “Hear this, oh Kings! Śrīkara
is not a mere cowherd boy. The God is pleased with
him. In his eighth birth from today he will be born in
Ambāḍi under the name Nandagopa. Then Mahāviṣṇu
will incarnate as the son of Nandagopa under the name
Śrī Kṛṣṇa.”
<div n="NI"/>Nandagopa was the eighth birth of this Śrīkara. (Śiva
Purāṇa, Śanipradoṣamāhātmya).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Varuṇa carried away Nandagopa.%} While Śrī Kṛṣṇa
was living in Ambāḍi as the foster-son of Nandagopa,
Nandagopa went to bathe in the river Yamunā. While
he was taking a dip under the water a servant of
Varuṇa carried him away to the realm of Varuṇa. As
Nandagopa disappeared the people of Ambāḍi ran
here and there in grief. At last Śrī Kṛṣṇa jumped into
the water and reached the city of Varuṇa, who praised
Śrī Kṛṣṇa and said that it was to see Śrī Kṛṣṇa that he
had carried Nandagopa away, and requested for
pardon. Śrī Kṛṣṇa pardoned Varuṇa and brought
Nandagopa to Ambāḍi. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 10).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Nandagopa swallowed by a great mountain-snake.%} (See
under Kṛṣṇa, Para 21).
