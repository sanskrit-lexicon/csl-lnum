<div n="NI"/>2) {%Genealogy.%} Uttānapāda and Priyavrata were the
sons of Svāyambhuvamanu, and Dhruva was Uttāna-
pāda's son. Dhruva had two sons, Śiṣṭi, and Bhavya
by his wife Śambhu. Suchāyā, wife of Śiṣṭi, had five
sons, viz., Ripu, Ripuñjaya, Vipra, Vṛkala and Vṛkate-
jas. From Bṛhatī, wife of Ripu, was born Cākṣuṣa, the
mighty and Cākṣuṣa begot a son called Manu by
Puṣkaraṇī, daughter of Vīraṇaprajāpati and one of the
offsprings of Varuṇa. This Manu was called Cākṣuṣa
Manu. And Cākṣuṣa Manu had ten sons by his wife
Nadvalā, daughter of Vairājaprajāpati, called Kuru,
Puru, Śatadyumna, Tapasvī, Satyavān, Śuci, Agni-
ṣṭoma, Atirātra, Sudyumna and Abhimanyu. Out of
the ten, Puru had the following sons by Āgneyī, viz.
Aṅga, Sumanas, Khyāti, Kratu, Aṅgiras and Śibi.
Aṅga married Sunīthā, and Vena was their son. The
famous emperor, Pṛthu was Vena's son.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Former life.%} The following story is told in the
Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa about the former life of Cākṣuṣa
before he was born as Cākṣuṣa. In that former life he
was Ānanda, son of Anamitra. Once a cat carried
Ānanda away and laid him on the bed of the child of
King Vikrānta, and the same cat deposited the king's
child somewhere else. And, Ānanda grew up as the
real son of the King. But, one day he told the King
the truth about him and left for the forest for tapas.
Brahmā appeared before him and blessed that he
would, in the next birth, be born as the sixth Manu
and thus Cākṣuṣa became the sixth Manu.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Chief incidents during his time.%} During Cākṣuṣaman-
vantara were born the famous Nara and Nārāyaṇa as
the sons of Dharma. It was also during this period that
Brahmā was born as Candra, Viṣṇu as Dattātreya and
Śiva as Durvāsas from Anasūyā, the purest of women
and the wife of Atri. (Devī Bhāgavata, Caturtha
Skandha).
