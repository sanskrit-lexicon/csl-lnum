CITRĀṄGADA II¦. A son of the Mahārāja Śantanu.
King Śantanu of the Candra dynasty had two wives,
Gaṅgā and Satyavatī. Bhīṣma is the son born of Gaṅgā;
of Satyavatī were born two sons, Citrāṅgada and Vici-
travīrya. They were very brave and learned. After
ruling his kingdom for a long period, living with Satya-
vatī and the three children Śantanu passed away. Be-
cause Bhīṣma dedicated himself to a life of unbroken
chastity Citrāṅgada was crowned King. Once when he
went to the forest for hunting he met with a gandharva
of the same name. Both did not like the other to keep
the same name and so a fight ensued. It was fought
in Kurukṣetra and lasted for three years. In the end
Citrāṅgada was killed. Bhīṣma felt very sorry and after
asking Vicitravīrya to perform the funeral rites crowned
him as King. (Devī Bhāgavata, Prathama Skandha).
