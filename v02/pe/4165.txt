MAHĀTALA¦. A section of Pātāla. The descendants of
the serpent Kadrū live here. These serpents are many-
headed and terrible monsters. Chief among them are
Kahaka, Takṣaka, Suṣeṇa, Kāliya and others. All these
serpents have long and slender bodies, large hoods and
are of very cruel nature. Still they are all afraid of
Garuḍa and so live quietly with their families in Mahā-
tala. (Devī Bhāgavata, 8th Skandha).
