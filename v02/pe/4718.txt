NANDĀ II¦. A river. Mention is made in Mahābhārata,
Ādi Parva, Chapter 214, Stanza 6, that while Arjuna
had been engaged in a pilgrimage visiting the holy
places in the east, he reached the banks of the rivers
Nandā and Aparanandā. Many of the scholars are of
opinion that this river flowed through the eastern side
of the forest Naimiṣaraṇya. When the hermit Dhaumya
talks about the holy places of the east to Yudhiṣṭhira,
he says as follows about the river Nandā. “The beauti-
ful mountain ‘Kuṇḍoda’ is a place which abounds in
roots, fruits and water. Nala the King of Niṣadha, who
was weary of thirst rested here. There is a holy temple
here called Devavana which is thronged by hermits.
Near this temple there is a mountain through the top
of which, two rivers Bāhudā and Nandā flow.” (M.B.
Vana Parva, Chapter 87).
<div n="NI"/>During the time of the forest life of the Pāṇḍavas,
Yudhiṣṭhira travelled with the hermit Lomaśa, through
the basin of the rivers Nandā, and Aparanandā. During
the Paurāṇic times some deities had lived in the basin
of the river Nandā, and men began to come there to
visit the deities. The devas (gods) did not like this and
so they rendered the place inaccessible to men. From
that time onwards the river basin of Nandā and the
[Page524-a+ 65]
mount Hemakūṭa have become prohibited area for
human beings. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 110).
