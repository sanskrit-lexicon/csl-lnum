SUṢEṆA V¦. Father in-law of Bāli, the monkey king.
Suṣeṇa, father of Tārā, deputed one thousand crore
monkeys to search for Sītā. (Vana Parva, Chapter 283,
Verse 2). Suṣeṇa, an expert in the science of medicine
and the art of warfare, was the son of the monkey
called Dharma. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>In the Rāma-Rāvaṇa war Suṣeṇa fought the Rākṣasa
forces and killed Vidyunmālī. Lakṣmaṇa swooned
on being hit by the arrows of Rāvaṇa who fought with
redoubled vigour following the death of Indrajit. Many
monkeys also swooned. Then Suṣeṇa, the medical
expert, brought back to consciousness the swooned folk
with the help of Viśalyakaraṇī, Sauvarṇyakaraṇī,
Śañjīvanī and other herbs.
<div n="NI"/>Suṣeṇa also attended the coronation ceremony of Śrī
Rāma. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa, Chapters
101, 123, 154).
