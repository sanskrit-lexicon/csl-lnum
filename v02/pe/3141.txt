KALI I¦. Incarnation of sin, the Sin-god.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Kaśyapaprajāpati, son of Brahmā, begot of
his wife Muni sixteen sons and Kali was the fifteenth
son. He was a deva-gandharva. The other sons of
Kaśyapa were: Bhīmasena, Ugrasena, Suparṇa, Varuṇa
Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Gopati, Suvarcas, Satyavāk, Arkaparṇa,
Prayuta, Viśruta, Citraratha, Śāliśiras, Parjanya and
Nārada. (4 Ślokas from verse 43, Chapter 65, Ādi
Parva).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How Parīkṣit controlled Kali.%} When Śrī Kṛṣṇa went to
Vaikuṇṭha, the Pāṇḍavas entrusted the administration
of the state to Parīkṣit, son of Abhimanyu and started
for the Mahāprasthāna. King Parīkṣit was travelling
the continent conquering places when he saw Kali in
the garb of a Śūdra King teasing a cow and bull
couple. Parīkṣit aimed an arrow at him and then Kali
came and bowed down before the King. The King did
not kill him. He let him go free but ordered him to go
away from his state. Kali was nonplussed because all
the land belonged to Parīkṣit and there was no place
for him to go. So Kali begged of the King to give him
some space to live. Parīkṣit then declared that Kali
could live in the following five places: Gambling’
Drinking, Woman, Murder and Gold. From that day
onwards the free movements of Kali were thus restricted
(Chapter 17, 1st Skandha, Bhāgavata).

<div n="NI"/>3) {%Kali, Lord of Kaliyuga.%} There are fourteen Man-
vantaras during the life of Brahmā. The life time of a
Manu is a Manvantara. This present period is the
seventh Manvantara. In each Manvantara there are
four yugas, Kṛta, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali. Kṛtayuga
consists of 17,28000 years, Tretāyuga consists of 12,-
96000 years, Dvāparayuga 8,64000 years and Kaliyuga
4,32,000 years. The christian era started in the Kali
era 3102 and after another 4,26926 years Kaliyuga will
come to an end and the present universe will enter
the eighth Manvantara. From the beginning of the
Kaliyuga acts of sin predominate and Kali, sin-god,
will lord over the world.
<div n="NI"/>Kali was born on the day Śrī Kṛṣṇa ascended heaven.
When Bhagavān Mukunda abandoned his body and
went to his place in Vaikuṇṭha. Kali came into being
binding all on earth. (Śloka 66, Chapter 1, Bhāgavata
Māhātmya).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Kali and Nala.%} Kali and Dvāpara were going to
the Svayaṃvara of Damayantī when they met Indra
and others returning from the Svayaṃvara. They told
Kali and Dvāpara that Damayantī was married to Nala.
Kali and Dvāpara felt it an outrage that Damayantī
should have married a man of the earth and not a deva.
Kali decided that Nala should be sent out of his
country and his matrimonial life made most unhappy.
Dvāpara consented to be his accomplice in this attempt.
Kali followed Nala waiting for an opportunity to enter
his body. One day, by an oversight Nala, without doing
the ācamana after passing urine, performed his sandhyā-
vandana. Taking that opportunity Kali entered the
body of Nala. Kali went to Puṣkara, brother of Nala in
the guise of a bullock and made Nala challenge his bro-
ther to a game of dice putting that bullock as a wager.
Puṣkara accepted the challenge. Nala wagered and lost
all his movable and immovable possessions and went to
the forests with Damayantī. Nala, prompted by Kali,
abandoned Damayantī in the forests and went his way.
Damayantī cursed Kali.
<div n="NI"/>It was at this time that the great serpent Karkoṭaka was
entrapped in a wild fire. Nala saved him from the fire
but in return the cobra bit him turning Nala into one
of blue hue and said “Oh Nala, let Kali who cheat-
ed you and is now inside your body suffer with the
poison I have injected into your body.”
<div n="NI"/>Nala roamed about and reached Ayodhyā and there
became the charioteer of Ṛtuparṇa, King of Ayodhyā.
When Ṛtuparṇa went to the second marriage of
Damayantī to Vidarbha, Nala went with him as his
charioteer. On the way Nala taught Ṛtuparṇa the
science of Aśvahṛdaya and Ṛtuparṇa in return
taught him the science of Akṣahṛdaya. When Nala
learnt the secret of Akṣahṛdaya he vomited all the poison
inside him and Kali left him. Nala was about to curse
Kali but refrained from it at the request of Kali. At
once Kali climbed on a Tānni tree (Beleric Myro-
balan) and went down from the tree when Nala left
the place. Tānni is from that day onwards considered
a cursed tree. (Chapter 58, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The world in Kaliyuga.%} The celebrated sage Mār-
kaṇḍeya had prophesied about the happenings in Kali-
yuga thus: In Kaliyuga all will be dishonest. Charity
and Sacrifices will be only for a name. Brāhmaṇas
would do the duties of Śūdras. Śūdras will become
prosperous. There will be sinners as kings. People will
[Page374-b+ 65]
be short-lived and the stature of the people also will
diminish. Beastly type of men will be on the increase.
Taste and smell will vanish. Women will be ‘Mukhe-
bhagās’. Men will sell rice and brāhmaṇas, the Vedas.
Women will sell their vaginas. The yield of milk from
cows will decrease. Flowers and fruits will become less.
Crows will be on the increase. Brāhmaṇas would become
beggars. Sages will be merchants. Brāhmaṇas would
without any reason grow hairs and nails. None will
observe the four āśramas correctly. Students will defile
the bed of their preceptors. Rains will be in and out of
season. Trees and plants will refuse to grow in many
places. There will be murder of people everywhere.
Merchants will be cheats and they will use false mea-
sures. Righteous persons will decrease and sinners will
increase. Girls of seven or eight years will become
pregnant and boys will become fathers. Young men at
the age of sixteen would be grey-haired. Old men will
continue practising the habits of young men. Wives
will lie with their servants. Wives will be prostitutes
even while their husbands are alive. People will die in
lots of hunger.” (Chapter 188. Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Kaliyugatīrtha.%} The greatest tīrtha of Kaliyuga is
the river Gaṅgā. (Chapter 85, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Duryodhana was the incarnation of Kali and Śakuni, that%}
of Dvāpara. (Chāpter 31, Āśrama Parva).
