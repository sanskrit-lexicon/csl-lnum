PARṆĀŚĀ¦. A river of western Bhārata. This river sits
in the court of Varuṇa in the form of a nymph. (Śloka
9, Chapter 1, Sabhā Parva). Śrutāyudha, a valiant
soldier who fought against Arjuna in the great Kuru-
kṣetra battle was the son of Parṇāsā. Varuṇa was the
father of Śrutāyudha and at the time of the birth of a
son for her she requested Varuṇa to grant her a boon
that her son would not be killed by anybody. Varuṇa
while granting her the boon gave the son a mace. That
[Page575-a+ 64]
mace had a peculiarity. If the mace was used against
anybody who was not fighting, the mace would turn
back and kill the user. With the help of that mace
Śrutāyudha gave Arjuna a fierce fight and in the
midst of the heat he forgot the condition stipulated by
Varuṇa and used it against Śrī Kṛṣṇa who was standing
nearby watching their fight. The mace turned back
and killed Śrutāyudha. (Chapter 92, Droṇa Parva).
