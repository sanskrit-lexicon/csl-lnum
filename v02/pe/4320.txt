MAṆIBHADRA II¦. A King of the Lunar dynasty. This
King had many children of his wife Kavikā. Of these
seven sons learned magic from Maya. The seven palm
trees which Śri Rāma broke by an arrow while on his
search for Sītā were but the cursed forms of these seven
sons. The Purāṇic story relating to Śrī Rāma giving them
relief from the curse is narrated in the Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa
of Kamba Rāmāyaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>The seven sons of Maṇibhadra after learning magic
from Maya created a huge cobra and travelled all
over the world on it. One day they reached a
mountain near Ṛṣyamūkācala. They saw the sage
Agastya coming that way and just to tease him they
coiled that cobra and hid it beneath the ground in the
form of a circle and they themselves stood on it as seven
palm trees in a circle and caused obstruction to the sage
in his path. The sage as he came near the trees knew
by his spiritual powers what trick had been played on
him and said cursing, “May you stand like this for ever”.
The princes knew the hideousness of the curse and
pleaded for redress and the sage said, “After centuries
the incarnation of Viṣṇu as Śrī Rāma would come and
give you salvation”.
<div n="NI"/>The princes stood there as trees grown to unusual heights
with round black trunks casting shades all around.
Underneath grew a shrubbage deep and thick and the
seven trees stood there presenting to the onlookers a
sight of wonder.
<div n="NI"/>Śrī Rāma and party reached the place of the seven trees.
Suddenly Rāma took his bow and arrows and pressing
his foot on a stone beneath sent an arrow and to the
wonder of all, the seven trees standing in a circle fell
all together and the arrow returned to his quiver.
<div n="NI"/>When Rāma pressed the stone on the ground with his
foot he was pressing on a vital point on the head of the
cobra lying coiled in a circle under the ground bearing
the seven trees. The cobra got a shock and instantly
straightened itself for a second and the trees thus came
in a row straight on the path of the arrow of Śrī Rāma.
They were all cut at once and before they had time to
fall down the serpent coiled itself again and regained
his original position and so the trees fell down in the
circle in which they stood. All these happened so quickly
that nobody was able to see what happened and so every
body was surprised to see all the seven trees in a circle
falling down by a single arrow. The princes were thus
relieved from the curse.
