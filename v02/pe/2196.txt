DURVĀSAS¦
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} A sage, who used to lose his temper
very easily. He is believed to have been born from an
aṃśa (part, aspect) of Śiva.
[Page256-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Three different stories are told in the
Purāṇas relating to his birth.
<div n="NI"/>(1) Once a quarrel, arose between Brahmā and Śiva
which developed into fighting, At the sight of Śiva
seething with rage the Devas ran off frightened, and
Pārvatī also got frightened. She told him ‘Durvāsam
bhavati me’. (It has become impossible for me to live
happily with you). Realising that it was his momentary
anger which made life miserable for Pārvatī Śiva
decided to transfer that trait of his character to some-
one else.
<div n="NI"/>The incident took place during the life period of
Śīlavatī, who was very much reputed for her chastity.
While Śīlavatī was carrying her husband Ugraśravas
(who though a leper yet desired to visit brothels) to
the house of a prostitute the muni Aṇumāṇḍavya
cursed Ugraśravas to die before sunrise the next day
with his head broken. (See under Aṇumāṇḍavya).
Śīlavatī made the counter curse, let not the sun rise the
next day, to the muni's curse. Accordingly the sun did
not rise the next day, and confusion prevailed every-
where, whereupon the Trimūrtis and the Devas, through
Anasūyā, the wife of Atrimaharṣi, got the curse of
Śīlavatī withdrawn. Pleased at this the Trimūrtis
asked Anasūyā to choose any boon she desired, and she
prayed that Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśvara take their
partial incarnations through her. Accordingly Brahmā
as Candra and Mahāviṣṇu as Dattātreya were born as
sons of Anasūyā. And, Śiva deposited his anger, which
had caused unhappiness to Pārvatī, in Anasūyā. The
child born out of that aspect of Śiva to Anasūyā was
Durvāsas. The name Durvāsas was very apt as the
child was born out of the anger of Śiva which had
made life miserable (durvāsa) for Pārvatī. (Brahmāṇḍa
Purāṇa, Chapter 44).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Once defeated in his fight with Brahmā Śiva took
refuge with the Naranārāyaṇas who were doing penance
in the plains of the Himālayas. Śiva told sage
Nārāyaṇa everything about his plight and he asked the
former to pierce his left hand with the Śūla. Śiva did
so and three streams of blood flowed out of the wound
made on the hand of the Ṛṣi, one stream towards the
sphere of the stars, another into the skull in Śiva's
hand and from the third stream Durvāsas was born.
Brahmā, who witnessed this miracle withdrew from
war and returned to his abode. (Vāmana Purāṇa,
Chapter 2).
<div n="NI"/>(3) In the fierce fight with the Tripuras Śiva, in great
rage, ultimately shot an arrow against them, and that
arrow, after killing the Tripuras, assumed the form of
a child and returned to the lap of Śiva, and the child
was named Durvāsas. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chap-
ter 160, Verses 14, 15).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Kuntī granted boon.%} Once while Kuntī was living in
the palace of Kuntibhoja Durvāsas came there, and
pleased with Kuntī, he granted her five mantras. It
was with the aid of those mantras that Kunti became
mother of Karṇa and others. (For details see under
Kunti Para 2).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Śrī Kṛṣṇa bathed in pāyasa (pudding).%} Once Durvāsas
came to Dvārakā where Kṛṣṇa and Rukminī looked
after him to his heart's content. Though, at times he
took only meagre food, at other times he destroyed
everything he saw and created trouble. Kṛṣṇa and
Rukmiṇī served him according to schedule. One day
[Page257-a+ 65]
the sage asked Kṛṣṇa to cook some pudding and it was
got ready. Then the sage asked Kṛṣṇa to smear his
(Kṛṣṇa) body with pudding. Kṛṣṇa did so except on
his feet. After that Durvāsas got down the chariot and
making Kṛṣṇa and Rukmiṇī serve as horses himself got
into it and drove away in great speed into the forest.
On the way he thrashed the ‘horses’ one ofter the
other. Neither Kṛṣṇa nor Rukmiṇī felt sorry about this
action of the sage. On reaching the forest he halted
the chariot and blessed Śrī Kṛṣṇa that arrows would
not hit the parts of Kṛṣṇa's body which were smeared
with the pāyasa. The spot at which the sage blessed
Kṛṣṇa became famous as Varadānatīrtha in after years.
It may be noted that Kṛṣṇa died by an arrow hitting
his foot which was not smeared with the pāyasa. (M.B.
Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 160).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Conducted yajña for Śvetaki.%} There once was a King
called Śvetaki equal to Indra. He conducted a yajña
of a hundred years' duration. Innumerable brahmins
were engaged in the successful conduct of the yajña.
Some years after the yajña began the brahmins went
their own way leaving it unfinished as the clouds of
fume all the twentyfour hours in the yajñaśālā irked
and affected their eyes. When Śvetaki requested them
to further cooperate to complete the yajña they
insultingly asked him to invite Śūdras for it. Then
the King went to the Himālayas and did tapas for
Śiva, who at last deputed Durvāsas to complete the
yajña, and under the maharṣi's aegis it was completed
within twelve years. On account of the constant offe-
rings of havis in Agni (fire) during the period Agni
fell a prey to indigestion, which was cured only after
it ate up the Khāṇḍava forest. (See Khāṇḍava dahana).
(M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 235).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Mudgala granted salvation.%} Once Durvāsas went to
sage Mudgala who was doing tapas in Kurukṣetra
taking food only rarely and demanded some food with
the object of testing his dharmavṛtti (righteousness).
The sage gave Durvāsas all the food he had with him,
himself starving, and Durvāsas left the āśrama after
eating a part of the food and smearing his body with
the rest of it. This process was repeated by Durvāsas
for six days, but Mudgala never felt or showed any
offence. Greatly pleased at the firm righteousness of
the King. Durvāsas blessed him to bodily ascend to
heaven. Immediately a vimāna (aeroplane) descended
from Viṣṇuloka and carried Mudgala in it to heaven.
(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 260).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Other information.%} (1) Durvāsas ran away in fear of
the Pāṇḍavas. (See under Duryodhana, Para 12).
