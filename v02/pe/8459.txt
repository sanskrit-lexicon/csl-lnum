VIRŪPĀKṢA II¦. A Rākṣasa (giant) who fought on the
side of Rāvaṇa against Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa. It is
mentioned in Uttara Rāmāyaṇa that this giant was
born to Mālyavān by a Gandharva damsel called Sun-
darī. Seven sons named Vajramuṣṭi, Virūpākṣa, Durmu-
kha, Suptaghna, Yajñakośa, Matta and Unmatta and a
daughter named Nalā were born to Mālyavān by Sun-
darī.
<div n="NI"/>All these sons held prominent places in the army of
Rāvaṇa. It is mentioned in Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 10,
that in the battle between Rāma and Rāvaṇa, when
Kumbhakarṇa was killed, the army was commanded by
Kumbha, Nikumbha, Makarākṣa, Mahodara, Mahā-
pārśva, Matta, Unmatta, Praghasa, Bhāsakarṇa, Virūpā-
kṣa, Devāntaka, Narāntaka, Triśiras and Atikāya.
<div n="NI"/>When Sugrīva devastated the army of Rāvaṇa and
caused havoc among the giants, Virūpākṣa, who was
an archer got on an elephant and entered the battle-
field. He confronted Sugrīva first. He thwarted the stone
flung at him by Sugrīva, and struck him. For a time
Sugrīva found it difficult to withstand him. But in the
battle which followed, Sugrīva struck Virūpākṣa down
and killed him. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa,
Sarga 97).
