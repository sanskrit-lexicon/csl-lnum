VEDA¦ (S).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Introduction.%} The root ‘Vid’ in Sanskrit means ‘to
know’. The books composed of the knowledge of the
[Page842-a+ 65]
Āryans, collected and compiled were called the Vedas.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The origin and importance of the Vedas.%} It is said that
Brahmā was the creator of the Vedas. Many say that,
for the performance of sacrifices Brahmā created from
Agni (fire), Vāyu (Wind) and Ravi (the Sun), the
three Vedas Ṛg, Yajus and Sāman which are eternal and
in accordance with regulations.
<div n="NI"/>The Vedas have two sides, the spiritual and the mun-
dane. Moreover all the explanations of the Vedas
from the Brāhmaṇas to the Bhāṣya of Sāyaṇa, pertain
to sacrifices. The literary meaning of Veda is mundane.
Considering these two points and the facts that they are
religious books and that they reveal the mental and
social outlooks of the early Āryans, and as the origin of
all the thoughts of Indians, all the Vedas, especially
Ṛgveda, hold a lofty place.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Parts of the Vedas.%} Mahāviṣṇu incarnated as Vyāsa
in Dvāpara Yuga and divided the Vedas. The first
Veda consisted of four pādas and a hundred thousand
granthas. Vyāsa divided it into four parts known as,
Ṛgveda, Yajurveda, Sāmaveda and Atharvaveda.
The sage and seer Vyāsa thus created by Ṛg, “Hautra”
(a collection of lyrics in praise of different Gods, to be
recited by the priest styled the ‘hotṛ’), by Yajus
“Ādhvaryava”, (a book of sacrificial prayer, of prose
formulas to be uttered by the ‘Adhvaryu’ priest, who
performed the manual work involved in a sacrifice), by
Sāman, “Audgātra”, (Songs meant to be sung at the
Soma sacrifice by a special class of priests ‘Udgātṛ’) and
by Atharva “Brahmatva”, (a collection of songs, spells
and incantations, for the healing of disease, the restora-
tion of harmony, the exorcism of evil spirits and to
celebrate the power and omniscience of God) and
established them separately. Paila, a scholar in Ṛg-
veda, and a disciple of Vyāsa, gave the original Veda
to Indrapramiti and its Saṃhitā (collections) to Bāṣkala
as gifts. Bāṣkala divided the Saṃhitā into four, and
gave each of them to Baudhya and others. Yajurveda
was divided into twentyfour branches. They were com-
posed by Vaiśampāyana of extraordinary intelligence,
a disciple of Vyāsa. Kāṇḍas (Chapters) such as Vāja-
saneya etc. were composed later by hermits such as
Yājñavalkya and others in the form of Smṛtis (tradition,
as handing down only the tradition derived from an-
cient sages, to whom the Vedas were ‘revealed’).
Jaimini the disciple of Vyāsa, divided Sāmaveda into
different branches. Sumantu and Sukarmā compiled
separate Saṃhitās (collections) from them. Sukarmā
composed thousand Saṃhitās. Sumantu the disciple
of Vyāsa took the Atharvaveda and taught it to
thousands of Paippalāda disciples. By the blessings of
Vyāsa, Sūta made the Purāṇa Saṃhitā (the collection
of Purāṇas). (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 150).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Branches af the Vedas.%} It has already been mentioned
that the Vedas are four in number called Ṛg, Yajus,
Sāma and Atharva. Each of these Vedas has branches
called Saṃhitās (collections) and Brāhmaṇas (treatises
relating to prayer and sacrificial ceremony). Āraṇyakas
are appendices to the Brāhmaṇas. Upaniṣads (secret
or esoteric doctrines) are appendices of the Āraṇyakas.
Thus each of the Vedas has Saṃhitās, Brāhmaṇas,
Āraṇyakas and Upaniṣads. All these are, in a way, ex-
positions of the Vedas. In all these expositions there
are numberless Sūktas. All these taken together are
called Vedic literature.
[Page842-b+ 65]
In the Saṃhitās there are lyrics in praise of different gods.
All these are spells and incantations (mantras) in the
form of songs. The under-currents of all these spells are
Vedas and stories from the Vedas. Generally speaking
the Brāhmaṇas contain prose texts giving practical
observations on sacrifice which are mentioned in the
songs of praise. Here and there stories from Purāṇas
and epics occur. The Āraṇyakas (forest-texts) got that
name, because they are books of instruction to be given
in the forest or writings meant for wood-dwelling her-
mits. As they contained esoteric spells and incanta-
tions which might cause injury even to those who were
not concerned with them instruction in them was not
given in towns or villages. The contents of the Āraṇy-
akas are the allegorical signification of the rites and
sacrifices and the mystic meaning of the Vedas.
<div n="NI"/>It has been mentioned that the Upaniṣads are append-
ices of the Āraṇyakas. Still there is not much differ-
ence between the two and hence they cannot be separat-
ed from one another so easily. The Upaniṣads are
called Vedāntas, (The aim and completion of the
Vedas), because they are the end of the Vedas. The
Vedāntas belong to the later period of the Vedic age.
Instruction in Vedāntas was given only after completing
the study of the mantras (Vedas) and the Brāhmaṇas.
The Upaniṣads contain philosophical speculations about
the conception of Brahman and the Vedas. The word
Veda includes the Vedāṅgas also. Vedāṅgas (Ancillaries
of the Vedas) are Śikṣā (phonetics), Vyākaraṇa
(grammar), Chandas (metrics), Nirukta (etymology),
Joytiṣa (astronomy), and Kalpa (ritual). At first
instruction is given in the study of Brahman and the
study of Vedas. When more discussions and expositions
on them are needed, the study of Brāhmaṇas and
Āraṇyakas are resorted to. In course of time the
Brāhmaṇas and Āraṇyakas, which contain discussions
and expositions of the Vedas became independent
branches of study under these names. That is why they
contain mainly prose texts.
<div n="NI"/>There are one lakh of mantras or spells and incanta-
tions in all the four Vedas taken together. They are
for blessing everybody and to make the four objects of
life easily attainable. Sāṅkhyāyana and Āśvalāyana
sorted and grouped the mantras. Accordingly there
are two thousand one hundred and ten mantras known
as Brāhmaṇas. Dvaipāyana and other hermits have
stated the number of granthas (verses) in Ṛgveda. It
is said that there are one thousand nine hundred and
ninety nine mantras in Yajurveda. There are one
thousand eighty-six branches also. The branches in
Yajus are known by the names Kāṇvī, Mādhyandinī,
Kaṭhī, Madhyakaṭhī, Maitrāyaṇī, Taittirīya, Vaiśam-
pāyanikā and so on.
<div n="NI"/>In Sāma Veda there are branches such as Kauthumī,
Ātharvaṇāyinī and so on; and songs such as Āraṇyakam,
Uktham, Ūham and son on. The number of Sāmavedic
verses are nine thousand four hundred and twenty-
five.
<div n="NI"/>Sumantu, Jañjali, Ślokāyani, Śaunaka, Pippalāda,
Muñjakeśa and such others were responsible for the
sorting and grouping of the mantras in the Atharva-
veda. Altogether there are one thousand six hundred
Upaniṣads. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 271).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Expositions of the Vedas.%} The religion of the Āryans
became an established one when Vyāsa had created the
[Page843-a+ 65]
Vedasaṃhitās. The aim of Vyāsa was to bring about
uniformity in the religious observances by performing
rites and rituals, religious ceremonies such as sacrifices
etc. without any flaw. Following this a very wide
Vedic literature grew up. The study of the Vedas,
critical review of meaning, the connection between
mantras and tantras (Chants and rituals), Grammar,
etymology, all these became inevitable. As the Vedas
could be looked at from different points of view, from
very early days, various types of expositions of the
Vedas came out. Seven types of commentaries,
Nairukta, Yājñika, Vaiyākaraṇa Jyautiṣa, Sāmpradāyika
Ādhyātmika, Aitihāsika (pertaining to etymology,
sacrifice, grammar astronomy, customs of a tribe,
Brāhma or Spiritual legends and ancient lore) were
the prominent among them. When the westerners
began research work in the Vedas, another branch of
literature also took form, known as the Āgamikas
(the historical). Even in the time of Yāska, who
was an authority on Nirukta (etymology) the Vedas
were expounded on the basis of legends and ancient
lore. Hints to this effect are seen in Yāska's works.
Mention is made about other types of expositions also,
in them. The last book of importance in the Sāmpra-
dāyika type of exposition, was Vedārthaprakāśa, of
Sāyaṇa. But the commentary of Skandasvāmī, the
books Ṛgarthadipikā and Udgīthabhāṣya of Mādhavā-
cārya etc. have spread the sāmpradāyika type of
speculations in India. There is another cult in India
which believes that everything seen in the Vedas is
spiritual and that the spells and incantations are
esoteric.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%The gods of the Vedas.%} All the gods known today
are not found in the Vedas. Even those who are found
do not have the prominence that is given to them now.
For example, the deity Viṣṇu, worshipped as one of
the three godheads today, is not as omnipotent as the
Indra of the Vedas. Though Viṣṇu is praised in five
spells in Ṛgveda, when compared with other deities,
he was not of much prominence. In the Vedas the
incarnation of Vāmana is not given much importance.
Even though Rudra is a recognized deity and mention
occurs about Kapardī, in the Vedas, there is not a song
of praise of Śiva in the Ṛgveda. There is no mention
at all, about the worship of the Phallus, Devī and so
on in the Vedas. The Vedas celebrate the Omniscience
of Varuṇa, Indra, Agni, Mitra, the Maruts and so on.
The lustre of Indra was gradually dimmed with the
efflux of time and he became a mere libertine in the
Purāṇas. The importance of many deities such as
Varuṇa, Agni, Mitra, Aśvin and so on was greatly dimi-
nished in the Purāṇas. Thirtythree deities pertaining
to Earth, Ether and Sky are praised in the Vedas.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%The rites concerning instruction in Vedas.%} Manu has
given certain instructions as to how the teaching of
Vedas should be conducted.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%The teachers of Veda.%} See under Guruparamparā.
<div n="NI"/>9) {%The period of the Vedas.%} The Indians believe that the
spells and incantations and the Brāhmaṇas are not man-
made, but are revelations by God. So they are con-
sidered to be beginningless and endless. The hermits
are considered to be seers of the spells. It is mentioned
“Mantradraṣṭāraḥ na tu Kartāraḥ”. (They are seers
of Mantra, not makers). In the opinion of one party,
according to this maxim, it is not necessary to search
[Page843-b+ 64]
for the creators or the period of creation, of mantras.
They hold that only the Sūtras (thread, clue, guide,
rule, aphorism) are made by man.
<div n="NI"/>The westerners and the modern thinkers of India do
not agree completely with this view. They believe
that the early Āryans who entered India, first settled
down in the Punjab and that the local civilization which
they had assumed, broke out as songs of praise. In
course of time, these songs of Praise took the form of
Ṛgveda mantras (saying, song, formula). In the begin-
ning there was only one Veda. Many believe that this
state continued up to B.C. 1500. It is a fact universally
acknowledged, that this Vedic literature is the most
ancient literature of the world. There is difference of
opinion as to the period of origin of this Vedic literature.
Prof. Macdonell and Prof. Jacobi are foremost among
those who have made their opinions. In the opinion
of Prof. Macdonell, the Vedic literature originated in
the period between B.C. 1500 and 1200. But Jacobi's
opinion is that all the Vedas were made before B.C.
4000.
