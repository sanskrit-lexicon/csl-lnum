AJAGAVA¦. Ajagava is a bow made of the horns of a
goat and a cow. Brahmins tormented the right hand of
the King Vena. From it the brilliant Pṛthu who shone
brightly like the God Agni, appeared as the son of Vena.
At that time the very first Ajagava bow, divine arrows
and armours dropped from the sky. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa,
Part I, Chapter 13).
