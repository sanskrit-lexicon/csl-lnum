KĀLINDĪ¦ (YAMUNĀ).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Kālindī alias Yamunā is one of the holy
rivers in India. The presiding deity of the river is
Kālindīdevī. Kālindī, the daughter of the sun has her
source in Kalinda mountaiṇ, and hence the name
Kālindī for the river. Kālindī joins the Gaṅgā at
Prayāga, and this confluence of the two rivers is called
Saṅgama, which is a sacred place.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Gave way for Śrī Kṛṣṇa.%} As soon as Kṛṣṇa was born
Vasudeva stealthily removed the child to Ambāḍi. Due
to heavy rains the Kālindī was overflowing, and Vasu-
deva begged Kālindī for a passage, and the river gave
way for Vasudeva to take Kṛṣṇa to Ambāḍi. (Bhāga-
vata 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Balabhadra dragged Kālindī.%} Balabhadrarāma once
stayed in Ambāḍi for two months. One day he was
picnicking on the banks of Kālindī with the Gopīs.
Under the influence of liquor he desired to play with
his companions in the waters of Kālindī. He called
Kālindī to his side, but the chaste Kālindī refused to
oblige him. So he dragged her by his plough hooking
her to it. In great fear Kālindī saluted him, and he
enjoyed with the gopīs for some time on its waters.
(Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Kālindī, Śrī Kṛṣṇa's wife.%} After Maya had built
Indraprastha for the Pāṇḍavas, Śrī Kṛṣṇa spent a few
days there with them. And, one day while Kṛṣṇa and
Arjuna were strolling on the banks of Kālindī the latter
saw there a beautiful woman performing penance and
he approached her. She told Arjuna that the object
of her penance was to get Kṛṣṇa as husband, and when
[Page375-b+ 64]
Arjuna passed on the information to Kṛṣṇa he took her
in his chariot to Dvārakā and duly married her.
(Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Soṅs of Kālindī.%} Ten sons, were born to Kālindī by
Kṛṣṇa. (Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Haṃsa and his son in Kālindī.%} Once Kṛṣṇa attacked
Jarāsandha and the son of his minister, Haṃsa, being
told that his father had been killed, committed suicide
by jumping into Kālindī. But, Haṃsa had not been
killed, and when he returned from the battlefield and
knew about the death of his son, he too jumped into
Kālindī and committed suicide. (Sabhā Parva,
Chapter 14).
