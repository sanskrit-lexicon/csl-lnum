AURVA I¦. (Ūrva, Ūrūja). A fierce saint of the line
of Bhṛgu Maharṣi.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Viṣṇu, Brahmā,
Bhṛgu, Cyavana, Aurva.
<div n="NI"/>Cyavana Maharṣi married Āruṣī, daughter of Manu.
Aurva was her child who was the grandfather of Jamad-
agni and the great grandfather of Paraśurāma.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} The Preceptors of the Bhṛgu dynasty were the
hereditary gurus of the Kings of Hehaya. Kṛtavīrya a
famous King of the Hehaya dynasty and father of Kār-
tavīryārjuna had his education from a Bhṛgu ṛṣi living
in his āśrama. On competing his education the king
paid lavishly and the Bhṛgus became rich thereafter.
Kṛtavīrya died and his sons did not very much like the
Bhārgavas (Bhṛgus) becoming rich by the wealth of
their ancestors. Knowing this the Bhṛgus started bury-
ing their wealth under the earth. Once a Kṣatriya
[Page076-b+ 65]
king forcibly dug out from the house of a Bhṛgu the
wealth he had safely buried and from that day onwards
the Kṣatriyas and the Bhārgavas became enemies. The
Bhṛgus were hunted down by the Kṣatriya kings and the
Bhārgavas frightened by this move left their abode and
went and hid in Caves in mountains far away. Among
those who thus fled was Āruṣī, wife of Cyavana. Āruṣī
was pregnant at that time and she hid her ‘Garbha’ in
her thighs while fleeing. A brahmin woman who saw
this went and informed the Kṣatriyas and they imme-
diately went and caught hold of her. Then the thigh
broke and a boy came out of it. Because he was born
from the thighs the boy was named Aurva. (Ūrū=
Thigh and so, born of a thigh). (Chapter 179, Ādi
Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The effulgence of Aurva.%} Aurva was born with fiery
radiance and the sudden effulgence made the Kṣatriya
Kings blind. Frightened they craved for pardon and
praised him. They got back their eyesight then.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Aurva and Baḍavāgni.%} Aurva bore a deep grudge
against the Kṣatriyas who had massacred his fore-
fathers. Aurva started doing rigorous penance and by
the force of his austerities the world started to burn. At
that stage the Pitṛs appeared before him and persuaded
him to withdraw from his penance. Aurva then told
them thus: “Pitṛs, while I was lying in the thigh-womb
of my mother I heard hideous groans from outside and
they were of our mothers when they saw the heads of
our fathers being cut off by the swords of the Kṣatriyas.
Even from the womb itself I nurtured a fierce hatred
towards the Kṣatriyas. No helping hand was raised
before the pitiable wails of our mothers”.
<div n="NI"/>The Pitṛs were astounded at the firmness of the vow of
Aurva and horrified at the thought of what would
happen if the penance was continued. They pleaded
again to cease his austerities and then submitting to
their request Aurva withdrew the fire of his penance
and forced it down into the sea. It is now believed
that this fire taking the shape of a horse-head is still
living underneath the sea vomiting heat at all times.
This fire is called Baḍavāgni. More about this can be
had under the head Baḍavāgni. (Chapter 180, Ādi
Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Aurva and the birth of Sagara.%} Ayodhyā was once
ruled by a celebrated King of Ikṣvāku dynasty named
Subāhu. He had as his wife Yādavī a good natured and
well behaved woman who was a gem among queens.
One day Tālajaṃgha a King of the Hehaya line of
rulers who was then the King of Māhiṣmatī defeated
Subāhu in a battle. Yādavī was then pregnant. Jealous
co-wives poisoned her; Yādavī did not die but the
poison affected the child in the womb.
<div n="NI"/>After the defeat, Subāhu and Yādavī went and stayed
with Aurva in his āśrama. For seven years they lived
there and then Subāhu died. Grief-stricken Yādavī was
about to jump into the funeral pyre and end her life
when Aurva stopped her from the act pointing out that
she was soon to deliver a child. After a few months she
delivered a son and Aurva called him ‘Sagara’ meaning
one with ‘gara’ (poison) in him. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa,
Chapters 16, 17).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Aurva and the sister of Garuḍa.%} Garuḍa, son of
Vinatā, had a sister named Sumati. Upamanyu, a sage,
wanted to marry her but neither she nor her relatives
liked it. Enraged at this the sage cursed Sumati saying
[Page077-a+ 65]
that the brahmin who married her would have his head
burst. The marriage of Sumati thus remained a prob-
lem for her parents. There was a friend of Vinatā, a
sannyāsinī, living in a forest and to find a way to escape
from the curse Vinatā sent Garuḍa to her. The sannyā-
sinī advised Garuḍa to approach Aurva to find a solution
for the problem and Aurva was therefore approached
for advice.
<div n="NI"/>It was at this time that the people of Ayodhyā came in
search of Subāhu and Yādavī who had left them years
before. When they knew of Subāhu's death they were
plunged in sorrow but were glad to know a son of
Subāhu, Sagara, had grown up to be a successor to
Subāhu. When Garuḍa made Aurva acquainted with
the pitiable tale of his sister Aurva decreed that Sumati
should marry a Kṣatriya instead of a brahmin and thus
tide over the curse. He then asked Sagara to marry
Sumati and blessed them saying that Sagara would one
day become an emperor and perform an Aśvamedha
yāga. Aurva then sent Sagara along with the people
to Ayodhyā where Sagara after defeating all his enemies
became the emperor of Bhāratavarṣa. (Brahmāṇḍa
Purāṇa, Chapters 18-21).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Sagara's sons and how Aurva helped in getting them.%}
Sagara ruled the land for three thousand years. He had
besides Sumati another wife, Keśinī. Both of them bore
no sons for Sagara. Dejected he entrusted the adminis-
tration of the state with his ministers and left for the
āśrama of Aurva. Aurva blessed them and prophesied
that Keśinī would deliver a son to continue the dynasty
and that Sumati would deliver sixty thousand sons of
no great use at all. Sagara and his wives, returned to
the palace and very soon both his wives became preg-
nant. In due time Keśinī delivered a son who was
named Asamañjas. But Sumati gave birth to a lump of
flesh. Greatly pained the King was about to throw it
away when Aurva appeared there and stopped him from
doing that. He directed him to cut the piece of flesh
into sixty thousand pieces and put one piece each in a
jar of ghee. Every year one prince would be born from
one of them. Thus Sumati got sixty thousand sons.
(Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 92).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Teaching of Aurva.%} In the evening of his life Sagara
went and stayed in the āśrama of Aurva. Aurva gave
him instructions on many a divine subject. He taught
him about the importance of the four āśramas, the
rituals to be practised by the different castes of Brāh-
maṇa, Kṣatriya, Vaiśya and Śūdra and many such
other things. Finally Aurva gave Sagara Brahmajñāna.
(Chapter 8, Aṃśam 3, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Aurvāśrama.%} All the Bhārgava ṛṣis together once
stayed in the āśrama of Aurva. Paraśurāma visited the
āśrama one day during that time and paid respects to
Bhṛgu, Khyāti, wife of Bhṛgu, Cyavana, son of Bhṛgu
and Aurva, son of Cyavana. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa,
Chaptre 63).
