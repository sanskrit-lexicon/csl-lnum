[Page663-b+ 64]
Only those facts, which have not been so related are
given hereunder.)
<div n="NI"/>1) {%A brief biographical sketch.%} Sahadeva was the son of
Pāṇḍu by his wife Mādrī. Two sons, Nakula and
Sahadeva were born to Mādrī by the Aśvinīdevas.
Along with Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīma and Arjuna, sons of
Kuntī, Nakula and Sahadeva spent their childhood in
the company of Sages at Śataśṛṅga mountain. Pāṇḍu
died and Mādrī followed him in the funeral pyre. After
that the Pāṇḍavas lived at Hastināpura under the care
of Kuntī. When the ‘lac-palace’ was burnt down, they
took themselves to the forest and ruled the kingdom
with Indraprastha as capital. The Pāṇḍavas, who
were defeated in the game of dice went again into
the forest. Their going into the forest has been des-
cribed as follows by Vidura.
<div n="NI"/>Yudhiṣṭhira, covering his face with cloth and Bhīma
stretching out his powerful hands moved into the
forest. Arjuna followed them throwing up sand par-
ticles. Sahadeva went rubbing his face with earth,
Nakula, the most handsome of men, followed them,
his body smeared with dust. Pāñcālī, her face con-
cealed in hair and weeping went behind the king. Sage
Dhaumya with Kuśa grass in his hands, accompanied
them chanting Vedic hymns. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter
80).
<div n="NI"/>Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Vidura why the Pāṇḍavas assumed
these different poses and attitudes and Vidura answered
him thus: Yudhiṣṭhira covered his face to show that
he would not retaliate in anger though he had lost the
kingdom due to cheating. Bhīma stretched out his
hands to show that he was unrivalled in manual power.
Arjuna threw out sand to say that he would shoot his
arrows into the enemy camp like particles of sand.
Sahadeva rubbed earth on his face as he did not want
anybody to distinguish his face. Nakula, the most
handsome of men, smeared his face with dust so that,
on the way, women should not desire him.
<div n="NI"/>When the Pāṇḍavas returned after twelve years' stay in
exile in the forest and one year's stay incognito
Duryodhana refused to allot them even a single house,
and war for eighteen days between the Kauravas and
the Pāṇḍavas was fought in the field of Kurukṣetra.
The Kauravas were wiped out. Yudhiṣṭhira became
king and performed the Rajasūyayajña after which the
Pāṇḍavas went out on the great journey and gave up
their lives.
