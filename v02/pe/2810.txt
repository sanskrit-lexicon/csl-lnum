JAGANNĀTHA¦ PAṆḌITA. A very powerful and ruthless
literary critic in Sanskrit. He lived between 1590 and
1665. He is also known as Paṇḍitarāja (King of scho-
lars). His most important and well-known work is
Rasagaṅgādhara. To this day it remains as an invalu-
able treasure in rhetorics. (Alaṅkāra Śāstra).
<div n="NI"/>His poetic theory is “Ramaṇīyārthapratipādakaḥ Śabdaḥ
Kāvyam”. (Words which convey beautiful meanings
constitute poetry). He vehemently opposed the dhvani
vāda (suggestive words and phrases conveying more
meanings produce more rasa than they literally
and apparently appear to carry). Citramīmāṃsā-
Khaṇḍana is another work of the Paṇḍitarāja. In
this work another rhetorician named Appayadīkṣita is
strongly criticised. The allegoric poem, “Bhāminīvilā-
sam”, is supposed to have been written by this great
rhetorician based on the untimely death of his wife,
Bhāminī. He has also written five other works, the five
Laharīs [Gaṅgālaharī etc].
