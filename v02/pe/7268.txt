SŪRYAKETU¦. A daitya (demon). Once this daitya
conquered the world of the gods and expelled Indra.
At that time Purañjaya was the King of Ayodhyā, who
was born in the Solar dynasty. Indra requested for his
help. Purañjaya agreed to help Indra, on condition that
Indra should stand as an ox and that he would sit on
the hump of that ox and fight. Accordingly he sat on
the ‘Kakud’ (hump) of the ox and fought in the battle,
killed Sūryaketu, and reinstated Indra in his former
position. Because he sat on the ‘Kakud’, Purañjaya got
the name Kakutstha. The dynasty of the King came to
be called by the name Kākutstha. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa,
Yuddhakāṇḍa).
