a nearby hillock the sage Tṛṇabindu was also doing
penance. Celestial maidens, Nāga maidens and their
lovers came to the āśrama and by their erotic sports
and dances vitiated the precincts of the āśrama. Pulastya
got angry and cursed all the maidens to become preg-
nant if they entered the āśrama area. Without know-
ing this curse Māninī, daughter of Tṛṇabindu came to
that spot and got pregnant of Pulastya. Pulastya then
married her and the celebrated Maharṣi Viśravas was
born to her.
