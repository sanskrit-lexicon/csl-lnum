ATRI I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%The son of Brahmā.%} Atri Maharṣi was one of the
mānasaputras of Brahmā. The mānasaputras were:
Marīci, Aṅgiras, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, and Kratu
(M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 65, Verse 10).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%One of the Saptarṣis.%} Brahma's sons, Marīci, Aṅgiras,
Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu and Vasiṣṭha are known
as the Saptarṣis (seven sages). (M.B., Śānti Parva,
Chapter 208).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Creator of the pracetases.%} The sage Prācīnabarhis was
born in the family of Atri Maharṣi. Ten Pracetases
(Prajāpatis) were born as the sons of this Muni. (M.B.,
Śakti Parva, Chapter 208).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Citra Śikhaṇḍī.%} Among the seven Munis known as
Citra Śikhaṇḍīs, we see Atri Maharṣi as one of the
Aṣṭaprakṛtis which form the basis of the Universe.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Important events.%} (1) {%How Mahāviṣṇu became Atri's son.%}
Kaśyapa had a son named Kaśipu. He was a very mighty
ruler and carried on his reign in an ungodly manner.
In a terrible battle which took place at that time between
the Devas and Asuras Kaśipu was killed. Prahlāda be-
[Page074-b+ 65]
came the Asura King. Then there was a battle between
Indra and Prahlāda. After six years' war, Prahlāda with-
drew, defeated. Later Mahābali, the son of Virocana
(grandson of Prahlāda) became emperor of Asuras. War
broke out again between Mahābali and Indra. In this
war, Mahāviṣṇu helped Indra. The Asuras were utterly
defeated. They sought refuge with Śukra, the Asura guru.
Śukra promised to help them. He set out to the Himā-
layas to receive a powerful mantra from Śiva. The
Asuras kept waiting for Śukra's return.
<div n="NI"/>At this stage, Mahāviṣṇu who was the protector of Indra,
came to Śukra's āśrama and killed Śukra's mother,
Kāvyamātā. Seeing this impudence of Mahāviṣṇu, Bhṛgu
Maharṣi was enraged and cursed him that he should be
born many times in human wombs. It is on account of
this that Mahāviṣṇu had to take many avatāras (incar-
nations). It was in this way that Mahāviṣṇu incarnated
as Dattātreya, the son of Atri. (Devī Bhāgavata, 4th
Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Atri and Parāśara.%} It was a time when Vasiṣṭha and
Viśvāmitra were in a state of mutual ill-will. Once King
Kalmāṣapāda was going about in the forest on a hunting
expedition. He met Śakti, the eldest son of Vasiṣṭha in
the forest. The King did not respect him properly. Śakti
transformed Kalmāṣapāda into a Rākṣasa by his curse.
The Rākṣasa who was also a cannibal, first swallowed
Śakti himself. Viśvāmitra offered whatever help he
could, to destroy Vasiṣṭha's family. Kalmāṣapāda ate
successively all the 100 sons of Vasiṣṭha. Vasiṣṭha, in great
sorrow and Sakti's wife, Adṛśyantī lived in an āśrama.
Adṛśyantī was pregnant at the time of Śakti's death.
In due course she gave birth to a boy who was called
Parāśara and who later on became the father of Vyāsa.
when Parāśara grew up, he came to know that his father
Śakti was eaten by the Rākṣasa. Enraged at this, he
started a yajña to annihilate the whole race of Rākṣasas.
As the yajña gained intensity and force Atri Muni arrived
there with certain other Maharṣis and dissuaded Parā-
śara from the yajña. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 181).
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%Atri's dispute with Vainya.%} Atri Maharṣi and his
wife once got ready to go for Vanavāsa. At that time the
poor Maharṣi's wife was in great distress because they
had no money to be distributed to their disciples and
children. She requested her husband to go to King
Vainya and to beg for some money. Accordingly the
Maharṣi visited King Vainya at his yāgaśālā (The shed
where a yāga is held). He began to flatter Vainya by say-
ing that he was the first among kings and so on. Vainya
did not like it. He began to dispute with Atri. Vainya
remarked that Indra was the first King. To settle the
dispute they went together to Sanatkumāra Muni.
Sanatkumāra sent them away reconciled. After that
Vainya gave Atri much wealth. After distributing all this
wealth among their sons and disciples Atri and his wife
set out to the forest to perform penance.
<div n="NI"/>(4) {%How Atri became Sun and Moon.%} Once there was
a fierce battle between Devas and Asuras. Owing to the
shower of arrows from the Asuras, the Sun and Moon
became dim. Darkness spread everywhere. The Devas
began to grope in the dark. They requested Atri Maha-
rṣi to find a remedy for this. Moved by their distress,
Atri suddenly transformed himself into the Sun and
Moon. The Moon gave light to the Devas. The Sun
burnt up the Asuras by his intense heat. Thus the
Devas were saved. This story was told by Vāyu Bhaga-
[Page075-a+ 65]
vana, to Arjuna. (M.B., Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 156).
<div n="NI"/>(5) {%Atri and King Vṛṣādarbhi.%} In the Mahābhārata we
find a story about a difference of opinion between
King Vṛṣādarbhi and some Maharṣis. This story was
told by Bhīṣma to Yudhiṣṭhira about the kind of per-
sons from whom Brahmins may accept gifts. Once the
Munis, Kaśyapa, Atri, Vasiṣṭha, Bharadvāja, Gautama,
Viśvāmitra, Jamadagni, and Paśusakhā, with Arun-
dhatī and Gaṇḍā, who were the wives of two Munis,
travelled round the world. Their object was to go to
Brahmaloka. At that time there was drought in the
world. King Vṛṣādarbhi, the son of Śibi, suggested that
the above-mentioned Munis should be called and given
wealth. They refused to accept it. Vṛṣādarbhi became
angry. He performed Homa in Āhavanīyāgni and from
the agnikuṇḍa, the Rākṣasī Yātudhānī (Kṛtyā) arose.
Vṛṣādarbhi sent Yātudhānī to destroy Atri and all
other Munis. As Yātudhānī was guarding a lotus pond
in the forest, the munis led by Atri happened to come
that way. The Maharṣis were able to recognize
Yātudhānī. They beat her with their tridaṇḍu (Trident
or a kind of magic wand) and reduced her to ashes.
After satisfying their hunger by eating the lotus flowers
the Maharṣis went to Brahmaloka. (M.B., Anuśāsana
Parva, Chapter 93).
<div n="NI"/>(6) {%Atri and Śrāddha.%} There is a passage in the Mahā-
bhārata in which Atri gives advice to the emperor Nimi
who belonged to Atri's family. The story of how Śrāddha
originated in the world which Bhīṣma had told Dharma-
putra was retold by Atri. A son named Dattātreya
was born to Atri, the son of Brahmā. Dattātreya be-
came King. Nimi was his son. Nimi's son died after
one thousand years. Nimi who was in deep grief at the
death of his son, ordained a Śrāddha in memory of his
son. On that occasion Atri Maharṣi came there and
explained to Nimi the importance of Śrāddha. (M.B.,
Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 91, Verses 20-44)
<div n="NI"/>(7) {%How Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśvara (Śiva) were born%}
{%as sons of Atri.%} There is no other woman in the Purāṇas
who surpasses Śīlāvatī in her fidelity to her husband. In
order to enable Ugraśravas, her husband, to satisfy his
passion, she once carried him on her own shoulders to
a prostitute's house. On the way, Māṇḍavya Muni
pronounced a curse that Ugraśravas should die before
sunrise. The grief-stricken Śīlāvatī pronounced a
counter-curse that the sun should not rise on the next
day. As the sun failed to rise, the Trimūrtis (Brahmā,
Viṣṇu and Śiva), accompanied by Anasūyā, Atri's wife,
went to Śīlāvatī. Anasūyā persuaded Śīlāvatī to with-
draw her curse. The Trimūrtis who were happy at the
success of their mission (of bringing about the Sunrise)
asked Anasūyā to demand any boon she wanted. Ana-
sūyā expressed her wish that the Trimūrtis (Brahmā,
Viṣṇu and Śiva) should be born as her sons and they
agreed.
<div n="NI"/>Mahāviṣṇu, under the name of Dattātreya, was born
as the son of Anasūyā. Śiva was born to her under the
name of Durvāsas. There is a story about it in the Brah-
māṇḍa Purāṇa. Once Śiva got angry with the Devas.
They began to flee for life. But Brahmā alone did not
run away. Śiva who became more furious at this,
pinched off one of the heads of Brahmā. Still he was
not pacified. Pārvatī who was alarmed, approached Śiva
and begged him to suppress his anger. At her request,
Śiva's fury was transferred and deposited in Anasūyā,
[Page075-b+ 64]
Atri's wife. Durvāsas is the embodiment of that element
of Śiva's fury.
<div n="NI"/>According to the promise, Brahmā also took his birth
as the moon from Anasūyā, the wife of Atri. (For that
story, see PURŪRAVAS). There is a story about that
also in the Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa. Once when Brahmā
was performing the task of creation, he experienced
carnal passion. Sarasvatī was the offspring of that
passion. When Brahmā saw her, he fell in love with her
also. This made him feel angry towards Kāmadeva. He
pronounced a curse that Kāmadeva should be burnt up
in the fire from Śiva's eye. (This is why Kāmadeva was
later burnt to death by Śiva). Although Kāma had
retreated from Brahmā his passion had not been sup-
pressed. Brahmā transferred his passion to Atri Maharṣi.
The Maharṣi gave it to Anasūyā, his wife. Since she
was unable to bear such a violent passion, she gave it
back to her husband. That passion emerged from Atri's
eye in the form of the Moon. This is why lovers experi-
ence strong passion for each other at the time of the
rising of the moon. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapters
39-43).
<div n="NI"/>(8) {%Atri and Gaṅgā Devī.%} Once, while Atri Maharṣi
was performing penance in Kāmada forest, there was
a terrible drought in the country. At that time, his wife
Anasūyā made a Śivaliṅga of sand and offered worship
to it. Then Atri asked her to give him a little water.
There was no water anywhere. Suddenly Gaṅgā Devī
appeared there and said to Anasūyā: “There will be
a hole here. Water will come out of it in a torrent.”
<div n="NI"/>Pure water began to flow from the place pointed out
by Gaṅgā Devī. Anasūyā begged Gaṅgā Devī to stay
there for a month. Gaṅgā Devī agreed to do so on con-
dition that Anasūyā would transfer her Tapaśśakti to
her for one month.
<div n="NI"/>Atri was pleased by drinking the water. He asked Ana-
sūyā where she got such nice fresh water. She explain-
ed to him all matters. Atri expressed his desire to see
Gaṅgā Devī. She appeared before him at once. Ana-
sūyā prayed to her that Gaṅgā should continue to exist
in the world always. Gaṅgā Devī answered that she
would do so if Anasūyā was prepared to give her the
fruit of one year's Tapaśśakti and of devoted service to
her husband. Anasūyā agreed to that condition. Sud-
denly Śiva appeared there in the shape of a Liṅga. At
the request of Atri and Anasūyā Śiva took his seat
there permanently assuming the name of “Atrīśvara”.
(Śiva Purāṇa).

(M.B., Droṇa Parva, Chapter 190, Verse 35).
<div n="NI"/>4. On another occasion, a King named Soma performed
