MAṄGALA¦. A deity in the form of Kuja or Planet Mars.
There are different versions in the Purāṇas regarding
the birth of Maṅgala.
<div n="NI"/>(1) Satī committed suicide at the Dakṣayāga and Śiva
greatly griefstricken at the loss of his wife started
penance. A sweat drop fell from the forehead of Śiva
doing severe penance and Maṅgala was the son born
of that drop. Śiva then installed Maṅgala among the
Navagrahas and according to the science of astrology
this Graha is considered the protector of the landed
property and the wife of a person. (Śiva Purāṇa, Rudra
Saṃhitā 1-10 and Skanda Purāṇa 4-1-17).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Śiva married Vikeśī daughter of Hiraṇyākṣa. One
day while they were engaged in sexual plays Agni
came to their presence. Enraged at this the eyes of Śiva
blazed with anger and a drop of hot water from his
eyes fell on the face of Vikeśī and she became pregnant.
After some days Vikeśī found it impossible to bear the
embryo of Śiva thus formed and she aborted it. A
child was born and the goddess of earth took it and
[Page477-b+ 64]
fed it with breast milk. It was that child who later on
became Maṅgala. (Skanda Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Maṅgala was born of the blood drops of Śiva.
(Bhaviṣya Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(4) Maṅgala was the son of Bharadvāja. (Gaṇeśa
Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Maṅgala was the son of Bhūmidevī. Devas, sages,
Brāhmaṇas, Manus and Gandharvas all worshipped
Bhūmi at the time of Varāhakalpa. It is also said in
the Vedas that Bhūmidevī is the wife of Mahāviṣṇu's
incarnation as Varāha. Maṅgala alias the planet Mars
was born to Bhūmidevī of Mahāviṣṇu as Varāha. (9th
Skandha. Devī Bhāgavata).
