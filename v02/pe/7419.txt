SVAYAṂVARA II¦. A Kṣatriya custom of princesses
selecting their husbands themselves. There are three
kinds of Svayaṃvara. These three types are stipulated
for Kings only. The first type is Icchāsvayamvara, the
second one is Savyavasthāsvayaṃvara and the third is
Śauryaśulkasvayaṃvara. No condition is attached to
Icchāsvayaṃvara. Anybody may be chosen as husband
according to the wish of the bride. Damayantī Svayaṃ-
vara is an example of this. In the second it will be
stipulated that the bridegroom will have to possess
certain qualifications. In Sītā-Svayaṃvara Śrī Rāma
drew the bow of Tryambaka, and married Sītā. This is
an example of the second type of Svayaṃvara. The
third type is meant for adventurous heroes. Arjuna's
marrying Subhadrā is an example of the third type of
Svayaṃvara. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 3).
