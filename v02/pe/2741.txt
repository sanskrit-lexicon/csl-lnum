ILLAKA¦. A person who led a very ideal family life.
Son of a Vaiśya in the city of Mathurā, Illaka had a
very beautiful wife. Illaka had one day to go to ano-
ther place and his wife wanted to accompany him. But,
Illaka did not allow that and went alone. Then she
waited at the gates looking towards the husband moving
fast away. And, when he completely disappeared from
sight she, who could not bear the separation, fell down
on the spot and expired. Illaka heard about the death
and without delay, he hurried back home. He placed
the dead body of his wife on his lap and wept. Weeping
thus he also expired. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Lāvāṇakalaṃ-
baka, Taraṅga I).
