AGASTYA¦-ĀŚRAMA. The Purāṇas make mention of
several āśramas connected with sage Agastya. The
Pāṇḍavas during their exile visited an āśrama of this
name. This is situated near Pañcavaṭī twentyfour miles
to the south-east of Nāsik. It is known as Agastya-giri
now. (Śloka 20, Chapter 80; and Śloka 1, Chapter 96
of Vana Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>The Mahābhārata mentions another Agastya-Āśrama
near Prayāga. Dharmaputra along with Saint Lomaśa
stayed here for some time. Vālmīki describes an āśrama
of this name which Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa visited during
their exile in the forests. (Chapter 11, Āraṇya Kāṇḍa
of the Rāmāyaṇa).
