SUDARŚANA¦ IX. A brahmin sinner who lived in the
Tretāyuga. The moment he touched the water in which
Viṣṇu washed his feet, he obtained remission of his
sins and entered Vaikuṇṭha. This story which is given
under, occurs in Padma Purāṇa, Brahma Khaṇḍa,
Chapter 17.
<div n="NI"/>There lived a brahmin sinner in Tretāyuga. He used
to commit sins such as eating food on the eleventh lunar
day, ridiculing conventional fast and vow, etc. When he
died, the men of Yama took his soul to the world of
Yama. At his order Sudarśana was laid in horrible
excrements for the period of hundred Manvantaras.
When he was released he was born on earth as a hog.
Because he ate food on Harivāsara (a fast-day) he
suffered hell for a long time. His next birth was that
of a crow and lived on excrements. Once the crow
drank the water which fell on the steps while washing
the feet of Viṣṇu. The crow obtained remission of all
its sins. On the same day it was caught in the net of
a forest man and died. Then a divine chariot drawn by
swans came and took the crow to the world of Viṣṇu.
