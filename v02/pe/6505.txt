SAUBHARI III¦. A hermit famous in the Purāṇas. A
Purāṇic story about this hermit's marrying the fifty
daughters of Māndhātā is given below.
<div n="NI"/>Saubhari saw two fishes engaged in coition, while he
was doing penance on the banks of the Yamunā. This
sight aroused matrimonial thoughts in the hermit's
mind. He instantly approached Māndhātā and in-
formed him of his desire to marry a princess.
<div n="NI"/>Māndhātā did not like to give his daughter in marriage
to the old hermit. Concealing his thought, he told the
hermit as follows:—“Out of my fifty daughters, she
who wishes to be your wife, shall be given to you.”
Saubhari, who had already read the thought of
Māndhātā entered the harem in the shape of a hand-
some fine youth, and all the fifty damsels liked him.
Thus Saubhari married all of them, and begot hundred
sons of each of them.
<div n="NI"/>This matrimonial life lasted for some time. At last the
hermit grew weary of this life. Discarding everything,
Saubhari went to the forest. His wives, who also had
become disinterested in worldly enjoyment, followed
him. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 9; Viṣṇu Purāṇa, 4, 2, 3;
