KARAÑJANILAYĀ¦. Analā, the mother of all trees.
She was the daughter of Dakṣa and the wife of
Kaśyapa. She is known as Vīrudhā also. That was how
Vīrut became a synonym of tree. It is believed that
Analā stays in the tree Karañja. To obtain blessings
from Analā people worship the Karañja tree. (Ślokas
35 to 36, Chapter 230, Vana Parva).
