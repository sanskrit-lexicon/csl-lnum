BĀLĀVATĪ¦. The daughter of hermit Kaṇva. She did
penance to please the Sun to obtain a husband of a
very good nature. The Sun appeared before her and gave
her some dates and asked her to prepare food with them
and bring them back. Bālāvatī began to cook the dates.
Though all the faggots she had gathered were consumed
it was not properly boiled. As there was no more fire-
wood she put her leg into the oven. Seeing this the Sun-
God was pleased and said “All your wishes will be
realized”. From that day onwards that place was called
by the name ‘Bālāpa’. (Padma Purāṇa, Uttara Khaṇḍa,
Chapter 152).
