GAṄGĀ¦. The famous and holy river of India.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin and general information.%} Gaṅgā had its origin
during the incarnation of Viṣṇu as Vāmana. When
Vāmana measured the three worlds in three steps the
nails on his left feet were raised high. They caused a
pore on the upper side of the universe. Gaṅgā, starting
from the finger of Viṣṇu's feet fell in heaven (Bhāga-
vata).
<div n="NI"/>The famous Viṣṇupadī, the flowing water (tīrtha) of
which washes away the sins of the people in the universe
is the very same Gaṅgā under discussion. For many
yugas (eras) this river confined itself to the heights of
the sky, otherwise called Viṣṇupada. This particular
spot is known as Dhruvamaṇḍala as it is here that
Dhruva, son of King Uttānapāda, does, his penance.
The seven sages who constantly go round and round
the Dhruvamaṇḍala take their bath in this holy river.
The course of the river is thus: starting from Viṣṇupada
it falls on devayāna glittering with crores of vimānas
and therefrom it descends on Candramaṇḍala which it
submerges. It follows its course again from there divid-
ing itself into four tributaries called Sītā, Cakṣus,
Alakanandā and Bhadrā and then falls in Brahmaloka
wherefrom it flows in all directions. Of the four tributa-
ries Sītā falls on the head of Mount Meru, flows down
to Gandhamādana, then circling through Bhadrāśva
varṣa falls into the eastern sea. Cakṣus falls on the
peaks of mount Mālyavān, flows through Ketumāla
and falls into the western sea. Alakanandā falls on
mount Hemakūṭa, flows through Bhārata Varṣa and falls
into the southern sea. And Bhadrā falls on the head
of mount Śṛṅgavān flows through Uttarakuru and falls
into the northern sea. Alakanandā flows through
Bhārata Varṣa and is regarded as the most sacred of the
four tributaries.
<div n="NI"/>Gaṅgā which flowed through heaven fell on the earth
after thousands of years of its origin. (Bhāgavata,
Pañcama, Skandha, Chapter 17).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Why Gaṅgā became Śiva's consort.%} Mahāviṣṇu was
once engaged at Vaikuṇṭha in a pleasant talk with his
wives, Lakṣmī, Sarasvatī and Gaṅgā when Gaṅgā cast
lustful eyes on Viṣṇu, who, behind the backs of the
other two wives returned the lustful glances. Sarasvatī
could not put up with that situation for a long time.
Therefore, she got up from her seat and beat Gaṅgā.
Lakṣmī tried to restrain Sarasvatī lest the quarrel should
become fiercer. Angered at this intervention Sarasvatī
cursed that Lakṣmī be born on earth. Gaṅgā got angry
that innocent Lakṣmī was thus cursed, and she in her
[Page277-a+ 65]
turn cursed that Sarasvatī be born as a river on earth.
Sarasvatī did not take the curse lying down, but cursed
that Gaṅgā also be born as a river on earth and take
upon herself the sins of the whole world. When all the
three wives of Viṣṇu got themselves thus into trouble
he told them as follows: “Everything has happened as
it should have happened. Lakṣmī may go to the earth
and be born in the home of Dharmadhvaja and grow
up as his daughter, but not from the womb of his
women. There you will purify the three worlds after
which you will be born as the plant called tulasī, and
be married by an asura called Śaṅkhacūḍa, who will be
born as a part of me. And, after that you will be turned
into a sacred river called Padmāvatī, and leaving the
river on earth your divine form will return to Vaikuṇ-
ṭha.” And, to Gaṅgā Viṣṇu said as follows: “You will
go to earth as a holy river to wash off the sins of people
there. A king called Bhagīratha will be leading you to
earth, and you will, therefore, be known as Bhāgīrathī
also. And, you remain there on earth as the wife of the
ocean of King Śantanu. Your divine form will return
to mount Kailāsa as the consort of Śiva.” As for Sara-
svatī, Viṣṇu asked her to be born as a river on earth,
her divine form ultimately returning to Satyaloka and
then becoming the consort of Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>And, thus it was that Lakṣmī became the consort of
Mahāvīṣṇu, Gaṅgā of Śiva and Sarasvatī of Brahmā.
(Devī Bhāgavata, Navama Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Gaṅgā born on earth due to the curse of Brahmā.%} Mahā-
bhiṣak, an emperor of the Ikṣvāku dynasty, went
to Satyaloka after he had attained heaven, to worship
Brahmā. Gaṅgā too happened to be there. In the
devotional atmosphere at Satyaloka a casual breeze
removed Gaṅgā's clothes slightly from position, and
Mahābhiṣak then cast a lustful glance at her which she
also returned. Brahmā, who was observing this exchange
of love got angry and cursed that Mahābhīṣak be born
as a King on earth and Gaṅgā as his wife. Gaṅgā
prayed for redemption from the curse, and Brahmā
told her that she would regain her old status after she
had delivered the Aṣṭavasus. As the consequence of
Brahmā's cure Mahābhiṣak was born as King Śantanu
in the solar dynasty on earth and he married Gaṅgā.
(Ādi Parva, Chapters 96 and 97).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Bhagīratha brought down Gaṅgā on earth.%} King Sagara
of the solar dynasty had two wives called Sumati (Vai-
darbhī) and Keśinī (Śaibyā). A son called Asamañjasa
was born to Keśinī, and 60,000 princes were born to
Sumati. Sagara drove out of the country Asamajñasaa,
who turned out to be an enemy of the people. The
60,000 sons of Sagara also proved to be a menace to the
world, and the Devas approached Brahmā for protection
from the menace. He assured the Devas that a sage
called Kapila will destroy the 60,000 evil fellows.
<div n="NI"/>During the above period of time Sagara performed an
Aśvamedha Yajña, and his sons went round the earth
with the sacrificial horse. But, when they reached the
sea-shore the horse disappeared. When the sons comp-
lained about it to their father, Sagara, he asked them
to look out for the horse in every part of the world and
bring it back. Not finding it anywhere on earth they
dug a hole and entered Pātāla, where they saw Sage
Kapila absorbed in meditation and the missing horse
tied to a pole near the sage. (It was Indra who had
carried away the horse and tied it there). The sons of
[Page277-b+ 64]
Sagara, believing that it was Kapila who had stolen
the horse were about to attack the sage when he opened
his eyes, and they were reduced to ashes in the fire of
Kapila's eyes.
<div n="NI"/>His sons having not returned even after a long time
Sagara asked his grandson Aṃśumān to seek them out,
and after an extensive search he saw Kapila at Pātāla.
Aṃśumān pleased Kapila with laudatory phrases and
the latter returned to him the sacrificial horse. Kapila
also pronounced the blessing that the grandson of Aṃ-
śumān would perform the purificatory rites of Sagara's
sons by bringing down Gaṅgā to earth from heaven.
Aṃśumān returned to the palace with the horse and
the aśvamedha was duly concluded.
<div n="NI"/>From Aṃśumān was born Dilīpa and from him Bhagī-
ratha. On becoming King, Bhagīratha handed over the
reins of government to his ministers and began efforts
to bring down Gaṅgā to earth. He did tapas for thou-
sand years on the slopes of the Himālayas when Gaṅgā
asked him to please Śiva first as he alone could face her
(Gaṅgā) fall on the earth. Accordingly he pleased Śiva
by his penance and Śiva agreed to receive Gaṅgā on
his head. With a terrific noise Gaṅgā came down on
Śiva's head. The haughty Gaṅgā wanted to carry down
Śiva also to Pātāla. Realising this ambition of her
Śiva blocked her passage with the result that she wan-
dered about in Śiva's matted hair for many years
without finding an outlet. Bhagīratha again did tapas
and pleased Śiva who shook his matted head and made
fall some water therefrom on earth. The water fell into
Bindusaras, and flowed in seven tributaries, the first
three, Hlādinī, Pāvanī and Nalinī towards the east, the
next three, Sucakṣus, Sītā and Sindhu towards the west
and the seventh tributary followed Bhagīratha. In this
manner they progressed a great distance till they reach-
ed the āśrama of the sage Jahnu, and the haughty
Gaṅgā flooded the āśrama. The sage got enraged at
this and drank up Gaṅgā. But Bhagīratha pleased the
sage who then let out Gaṅgā through his ears. Thence-
forth Gaṅgā came to be called Jāhnavī also. Gaṅgā
again followed Bhagīratha to Pātāla and made the sons
of Sagara attain salvation by purifying them with her
waters. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Cantos 43
and 44; Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 97; Devī Purāṇa,
Dvitīya Skandha; Droṇa Parva, Chapter 60; Anuśāsana
Parva, Chapter 4 and Vana Parva, Chapter 109).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Gaṅgā flowed into the sea.%} After the purificatory rites
of the sons of Sagara were over, Bhagīratha conducted
Gaṅgā to the sea and with its waters the sea became
full. (Vana Parva, Chapter 109, Verses 18-21).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Gaṅgā set on the thighs of Pratīpa.%} Gaṅgā once fell
in love with Pratīpa, father of Śantanu, and set on his
right thigh when he (Pratīpa) was doing penance on
the banks of the Gaṅgā for a son. Pratīpa did not agree
to Gaṅgā's proposal that he should marry her and told
her thus: “the right thigh is for the children and
daughters-in-law to sit on and the left thigh for the
wife; therefore, you be my son's wife.”
<div n="NI"/>Then Pratīpa called his son Śantanu and told him:
“Sometime back a divine woman came to me and I
promised to wed her to you. Therefore, if any divine
woman approaches you for a son you must accept her,
and whatever she may do you must not object to
that...”. Not long after this Pratīpa crowned Śantanu
[Page278-a+ 65]
King and left for the forest, (Ādi Parva, Chapter 97).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Aṣṭavasus and Gaṅgā.%} While the wife of Dyau, one
of the Aṣṭavasus (eight Vasus) was roaming about in
the forest she saw Nandinī (the divine cow) grazing
with her calf near the āśrama of Vasiṣṭha, and she
desired to have the cow to be presented to her intimate
friend Jitavatī, the daughter of King Uśīnara. She
informed her husband, Dyau about this desire of hers,
and Dyau told his relations about it. Next day the
Aṣṭavasus, in the absence of Vasiṣṭha at the āśrama,
stole off Nandinī and her calf. When Vasiṣṭha returned
to the āśrama the cow and calf were missing, and he
divined the reason for it with his divine eyes. He cursed
that the Aṣṭavasus be born as men on earth, and when
they prayed for redemption from the curse Vasiṣṭha
told them that they would be born as men within one
year from that day, die at once and return to heaven
At the same time the sage said that Dyau alone, who
took the leading part in stealing the cow, would live on
earth for a longer period before he returned to heaven.
(The reputed Bhīṣma was this Dyau). The Aṣṭavasus
set out for the earth to be born as men and on their
way they met Gaṅgā and told her about their curse
etc. Gaṅgā also told them about her curse, and permitt-
ed them to be born in her womb. (Ādi Parva, Chapter
99).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Gaṅgā became the wife of Śantanu and the Aṣṭavasus were%}
{%born.%} Once while hunting on the banks of the Gaṅgā
Śantanu saw a beautiful maiden and they fell in love
with each other. She agreed to become his wife on the
condition that he would not oppose whatever she said.
Śantanu agreed to it and married her. Soon after a
child was born to them and in the very presence of
Śantanu, she threw the child into the Gaṅgā. As per
previous condition Śantanu kept mum at this. She
threw into the river the seven Aṣṭavasus, who were
born to her in succession. When she was about to
throw the last eighth of the Aṣṭavasus (Dyau) into
the river Śantanu prevented her. She got angry at
this and disappeared with the child. (Ādi Parva, Chap-
ter 98).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Śantanu got back the son.%} Thirtytwo years after,
Śantanu went hunting again on the banks of the Gaṅgā
where he saw the river obstructed in its course with
arrows by a handsome boy. Śantanu did not recognise
that the boy was his son, who had been named Deva-
vrata by Gaṅgā. Devavrata disappeared after throwing
Śantanu into an illusion by his magic power. All of a
sudden a doubt dawned in his mind whether the boy
was his own son, and he called out to Gaṅgā to show
him the boy. Gaṅgā appeared with her son with beau-
tiful ornaments on him and spoke to Śantanu thus:
“This is Devavrata, the eighth son whom you entrusted
to me. He has mastered everything in archery from
Vasiṣṭha, and he is Dyau (the vasu) son of Aṅgi-
ras reborn. You may please take charge of him.” After
saying this she returned to heaven. (Ādi Parva, Chap-
ter 100).
<div n="NI"/>10) Gaṅgā and Subrahmaṇya. (See under Subrahma-
ṇya).
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Gaṅgā and Bhīṣma. (See under Bhīṣma).%}
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Greatness (divine nature) of Gaṅgā.%} Mahābhārata has
(Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 26), the following on the
greatness of Gaṇgā.—
<div n="NI"/>If, after death, the bones of the dead are deposited
[Page278-b+ 64]
in Gaṅgā the departed will attain heaven. Even if one
had sinned throughout his life he would attain Viṣṇu-
pāda (heaven) if he worshipped Gaṅgā. Bathing in the
Gaṅgā is as beneficial as performing hundred yajñas.
As long as the bones of one remain in the waters of the
Gaṅgā so long will he occupy an honourable seat in
heaven. He who has come in contact with its water will
shine forth as the sun devoid of all darkness. Places
which are not favoured by its waters will become barren
like night without the moon and trees without flowers.
Gaṅgā water is more than enough to satisfy living
things in all the three worlds. He who does penance
standing on one leg for thousand years, and he who
gives up his body in the waters of the Gaṅgā are on
a par with each other. God attaches more importance
to him who has fallen into the Gaṅgā than to him, who
has performed tapas hanging by his head for a thousand
years. He who smears the sand on the banks of the Gaṅgā
on his body will get the lustre and glow of the devas,
and he, who smears the sand on his head will shine
forth like the Sun. All the sins of those on whom has
blown the air which had come in contact with Gaṅgā
water will be swept away. It should be known that
Gaṅgā water can wash off all sins and purify mortals.
The Agni Purāṇa (Chapter 110) has the following on
this subject.
<div n="NI"/>Through whatever places the Gaṅgā flows those places
become sublime and sacred. Gaṅgā is the refuge of all
created beings who aspire for the final good. If Gaṅgā
is worshipped daily it will save families both on the
mother's and the father's side from evil fate. To drink
Gaṅgā water is better than the observance of a thou-
sand lunar months. If one worships Gaṅgā for a month
one will derive all the benefits of having performed all
the yajñas. Even the blind (the ignorant) who worship
Gaṅgā, will attain equal status with the devas. The
sight of Gaṅgā, contact with its waters and drinking
Gaṅgā water will purify people in thousands and lakhs.
<div n="NI"/>13) {%Gaṅgā and Rādhā.%} Gaṅgā is Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa li-
quidified into water. Once in goloka Rādhādevī attempt-
ed to drink Gaṅgā dry, who, terror-stricken, hid
herself at the feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and the whole
world experienced difficulties due to non-availability
of water. Śrī Kṛṣṇa came to know of the situation and
made Gaṅgā appear again on earth. (Devībhāgavata,
Navama Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>14) {%Symbols and vehicle of Gaṅgā.%} Gaṅgā, white in colour
rests on makaramatsya (a variety of fish) holding in
her hands a pot and lotus flowers. (Agni Purāṇa, Chap-
ter 50).
