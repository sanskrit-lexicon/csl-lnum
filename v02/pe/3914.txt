KUŚANĀBHA¦. A son born to Kuśa of Vaidarbhī. (For
Genealogy see under Viśvāmitra). Sage Kuśa had four
sons, namely Kuśāmba, Kuśanābha, Asūrtarajasa and
Vasu, and Kuśanābha built Mahodayapura and lived
there. One hundred daughters were born to him of his
wife Ghṛtācī. Vāyubhagavān once asked the girls to
marry him at which proposal they laughed at him in
derision. He cursed them and made them hunch-backed
ugly women, and Kuśanābha felt very sorry about
this cruel fate of his daughters.
<div n="NI"/>To Somadā, daughter of a Gandharva woman called
Ūrmilā, had been born a son, Brahmadatta, due to the
mental power of the sage Cūli Kuśanābha gave in
marriage his hundred daughters to Brahmadatta, and
they were cured of their hunch at the touch of Brahma-
datta and became their previous beautiful selves.
<div n="NI"/>Kuśanābha conducted the yajña called Putrakāmeṣṭi,
and Kuśa, who was so pleased by the yajña blessed him
to have a son called Gādhi. Viśvāmitra was the son
of this Gādhi. Viśvāmitra had also a sister Satyavatī,
whom Ṛcīka wedded. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa,
Cantos 32-35).
