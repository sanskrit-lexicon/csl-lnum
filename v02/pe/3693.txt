KṚTAVARMĀ¦. A King of the Vṛṣṇi dynasty. In the
previous generation of Vṛṣṇi also a Kṛtavarman is notic-
ed. The genealogy of both is given below.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus: Brahmā
Atri—Candra—Budha—Purūravas—Āyus—Nahuṣa—
Yayāti—Yadu—Sahasrajit—Śatajit—Hehaya—Dharma
Kunti—Sadājit—Dhanaka.
<div n="NI"/>Dhanaka had four sons called Kṛtavīrya, Kṛtāgni, Kṛta-
varman and Kṛtaujas, and one of the four was the first
Kṛtavarman.
<div n="NI"/>The dynasty continues again from Kṛtavīrya—Kṛtavīrya-
Kārtavīryārjuna—Madhu—Vṛṣṇi—Yudhājit—
Śini—Satyaka—Sātyaki (Yuyudhāna)—Jaya—Kaṇi—
Anamitra—Pṛśni—Citraratha—Viḍūratha—Śūra—Śini
-Bhoja—Hṛdīka—Kṛtavarman.
<div n="NI"/>Hṛdīka had four sons, viz. Devavāha, Gadādhanvan,
Kṛtavarman and Śūra. And, Sūra begot of his wife,
Māriṣā ten sons, i.e. Vasu, Devabhāga, Devaśravas,
Ānaka, Sṛñjaya, Kākānīka, Śyāmaka, Vatsa, Kavūka
and Vasudeva. Śrī Kṛṣṇa was the son of Vasudeva. The
Kṛtavarman referred to below was the brother of Kṛṣ-
ṇa's grand-father.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Kṛtavarman and Syamantaka.%} King Satrājit had in his
possession the famous gem called Syamantaka. The
King's brother Prasena, went for hunting with this jewel
on him. A lion killed Prasena, and Jāmbavān killed
the lion and got the gem. A scandal was circulated to the
effect that Śrī Kṛṣṇa had stolen the gem. But, Kṛṣṇa
got back the gem from Jāmbavān and handed it over
[Page431-a+ 64]
to Satrājit, who in turn, gave his daughter Satyabhāmā
in marriage to Kṛṣṇa. Though Satrājit wanted to give
the gem—Syamantaka—to Kṛṣṇa as dowry, the latter
did not accept it.
<div n="NI"/>Akrūra and Kṛtavarman were bosom friends, and they
incited another Yādava King Śatadhanvā, to grab the
Syamantaka. Śatadhanvā killed Satrājit and took poss-
ession of the gem. Hearing about this murder Śrī
Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadrarāma set out to kill Śatadhanvā,
who, in great alarm, started for north after entrusting
the gem to Akrūra and Kṛtavarman. His horse died
at Mithilāpurī and he began running. Balabhadra and
Kṛṣṇa ran after him, caught and killed him. But, they
did not get the Syamantaka.
<div n="NI"/>Now Akrūra and Kṛtavarman began their penance at
Kāśī. Seven years passed thus when famine broke out
in Dvārakā. When once upon a time famine stalked
Kāśī the king had brought Śvaphalka, father of Akrūra,
over to Kāśī, and there was no more famine in the
country. Therefore, when famine broke out in Dvārakā
the Yadavas thought the presence of Śvaphalka's son,
Akrūra would dispel the famine. Accordingly Akrūra
was recalled to Dvārakā, and along with him returned
Kṛtavarman also. Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadra decided
that Syamantaka should be kept by Akrūra himself.
