AMARAKAṆṬAKA¦. A mountain. It was on this
mountain that some parts of Tripura, which was burnt
by Śiva fell. From that time it became a holy place. In
Padma Purāṇa, Ādi Khaṇḍa, Chapter 15, we see the
following passage about the benefits obtained by visit-
ing this holy place. “One who goes to Amarakaṇṭaka
mountain will enjoy the fourteen worlds for thirtyseven
thousand crores of years. Afterwards he will be born on
earth as King and reign as supreme emperor. A visit to
Amarakaṇṭaka has ten times the value of an Aśvamedha.
If one has Śiva's darśana there, one will attain Svarga.
At the time of eclipse, all kinds of holy things converge
towards Amarakaṇṭaka. Those who take their bath in
Jvāleśvara in Amarakaṇṭaka will enter Svarga. The
dead will have no rebirth. Those who renounce their
lives at Jvāleśvara will live in Rudraloka till the time of
great Deluge. In the valley of Amarakaṇṭaka and in the
Tirtha live Devas known as Amaras and numerous Ṛṣis.
Amarakaṇṭaka Kṣetra has a circumference of one yojana.
(about eight miles).
