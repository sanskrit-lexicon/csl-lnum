DEVĪ¦. (Mahāmāyā). Though Devī is without a beginn-
ing it is told how she became first visible to living beings.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Beginning:%} While Mahāviṣṇu was resting on a fig
leaf in the assumed form of a child he began thinking
as to who he was, who created him and how he should
act. And then a celestial voice announced as follows:
<div n="NI"/>Sarvaṃ khalvidamevāham
<div n="NI"/>Nānyadasti sanātanam.
<div n="NI"/>(All that is, I am. There is nothing eternal but me.).
This declaration astonished Viṣṇu, but he could not
understand who made it. While he was meditating
upon it, Devī appeared to him in the following manner.
Devī

Kṣudhā (thirst), Nidrā (sleep), Dayā (compassion), Gati,

of shame), Jṛmbhā and Tandrā (laziness).
<div n="NI"/>And, the Devī spoke to Mahāviṣṇu as follows:—After
all, what is there to be wondered at. Whenever the
world faced the phenomenon of Sṛṣṭisthitilaya (crea-
tion, existence and absorption into the primordial force)
you too have come up due to the power of Mahāśakti.
As for Parāśakti (the ultimate, universal force) it is
above and beyond all attributes. We, all of us, possess
attributes. From the nābhi (navel) of yourself in whom
sattvaguṇa (gentle attributes) predominates will be
born Brahmā in whom rajoguṇa (active attributes)
will predominate, and from the centre of his brows
will be born Rudra with tamoguṇa (black, destructive
attributes). Brahmā, by the force of his tapas will earn
powers of creation and will with his rajoguṇa create
the world blood-red in colour, and you will be the
sustainer and guardian of that world. The very same
world will be annihilated by Rudra at the end of the
Kalpa era. You please do know that I am the sāttvic
force which depend on you for the purpose of creation.
All creations of worlds have been made according to
the suggestions of Devī.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Origin of Devī.%} Once King Janamejaya questioned
Vyāsa about the birth of Devī to which he replied as
follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Even Brahmāviṣṇumaheśvaras (Brahmā, Viṣṇu and
Śiva—the Hindu trinity) are not capable of thinking
about the origin of Devī. Then, what about me? Yet
let me make an attempt. All the forces—everything—
which appear in various names and forms are in fact
Devī herself, her different manifestations. Just as a
master actor appears on the stage in different roles for
the delectation of the audience the formless Devī, on
behalf of the Devas, assumes many forms and imposes
upon herself attributes though in fact she is without any
attribute whatsoever. Thus, depending on her various
forms, actions etc. she is addressed by different names.
(Devī Bhāgavata, Pañcama Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Five forms of Devī.%} When primordial nature (Mūla-
prakṛti) incarnated or manifested in the form of Viṣṇu
the desire for creation raised its head in him. And, at
once the Devī—female—aspects in Viṣṇu manifested
in five forms like Durgā, Lakṣmī, Sarasvatī, Sāvitrī and
Rādhā. These five forms are designated as the
Pañcadevīs. Brief notes on the five Devīs are given
below.
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Durgādevī.%} Mother of Gaṇeśa bhagavān. (God with
the elephant's head). She is the consort of Śiva.
Nārāyaṇī, the Viṣṇumāyā, is none else than Durgā.
She is also perfect Brahma, the one and the only one
with no second to it. She is worshipped by Devas like
Brahmā and by sages and maharṣis. She is the basis,
the root and root cause of everything. She is eternal,
upholder of dharma, truth itself and the giver and
promoter of happiness, reputation, welfare, salvation
etc. as also of sorrow, grief, pain etc. She takes great
[Page217-a+ 64]
pleasure in removing the worries and sorrows of devo-
tees who seek refuge in her. She is all-power, achieve-
ments and assets personified. All imaginable permuta-
tions and combinations of every attribute comprise in
her and she it is who activates the universal soul.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Lakṣmī.%} This Devī is the most sublime form of the
universal soul, nay, the universal soul itself. She is all
wealth and riches personified, and she is the very seat of
beauty, compassion, welfare, peace, all goodness etc.
Evil traits like anger, avarice, haughtiness etc. are miles
away from her. She is all sympathy and kindness
towards her devotees. In Vaikuṇṭha, as Mahālakṣmī she
is ever engaged in the service of her husband, Viṣṇu.
In heaven she is the very glory of it. In houses she
appears as the welfare and prosperity of the inmates.
She is in fact beauty itself and is the essence of beauty
everywhere. She is all-merciful, and worshipped by
all.
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%Sarasvatī.%} She is very base and fountain head of and
the presiding deity of the word, intellect, knowledge,
the arts etc. She also is of the form of the universal
soul and liberally grants intellect, poetical skill, reason
and logic, understanding capacity etc. to her devotees.
The finest music with all its beauties originates from
her. Yes, she is the goddess of all learning, fine arts and
every branch of knowledge. Like the ice piece, the
Jasmine flower etc. she is beautiful in her white cover.
She recited the holy names of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. She is of the
form of tapas and blesses those who perform it. In fact,
she it is who grants all gifts and powers of understand-
ing. She is the goddess of language and learning (Vāṇī-
mātā) and without her human beings would lose their
capacity to speak.
<div n="NI"/>(4) {%Sāvitrīdevī.%} She is mother of the four varṇas (castes,
classes) Vedāṅgas, the tāntric science etc. She is of
the form of Japa (chanting of holy names and mantras),
tapas, the effulgence of Brahman, the very essence of
truth and existence and supreme bliss. She is eternal
and grants salvation. She forms the very basis and pith
and core of the glowing presence of the universal soul.
This world is pure, and has been purified by the touch
of the sacred feet of this Devī.
<div n="NI"/>(5) {%Rādhādevī.%} Rādhikādevī, fifth of the pañcaprakṛtis is
the presiding deity over the five prāṇas and She is of
the form of those prāṇas. She is exceptionally beautiful
endowed with all fortunes and happiness, sublime and
serious, and the consort of Śrī Kṛṣṇa and as eternal
and equally endowed with divine attributes as the lord.
She is formless also, above and beyond attributes,
unattached and detached, and not visible even to the
great Devas and munis by the naked eye. Her clothes
even Agni would not burn. She was born, in Vārāha
Kalpa as the daughter of Vṛṣabhānu, and because her
sacred feet trod over this land, Bhārata (India) became
holy. Once Brahmā did tapas for 60,000 years to have
a glimpse of the Devī's lotus feet, but could not. People
were able to see her only after she, in unbounded com-
passion for the world, incarnated herself in Vṛndāvana
(See Prakṛti).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Aṃśarūpa(s)—partial manifestations of Devī.%} The
above discussion was concerned with the five forms of the
Devī in her full and complete forms. Now, there are
six other Devīs, who are partial manifestations or born
from certain parts of the Devī.
[Page217-b+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Gaṅgādevī.%} This Devī who flows in the form of
water and washes off men's sins takes her origin from
the body of Mahāviṣṇu. (There is another story which
traces Gaṅgā's origin to the Aṇḍa (egg or seed) of
Brahmā). (See Gaṅgā).
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Tulasī.%} She is the lover and also the servant at
the feet of Viṣṇu. She also washes off men's sins and
promotes their welfare. (See Tulasī).
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%Manasādevī%} Manasādevī, who was born as a dau-
ghter of Kaśyapa is another partial incarnation of
Mahāmāyā. She is a great tapasvinī, a favourite dis-
ciple of Śaṅkara, unique in learning and erudition,
sister of Ananta (the king of Serpents), the presiding
deity of Mantras, wife of Jaratkāru muni and mother
of Āstīka muni. (See Manasādevī).
<div n="NI"/>(4) {%Devasenādevī.%} Since this Devī has been born out of a
sixth part of Mahāmāyā she is called Ṣaṣṭhīdevī also. It
is this Devī, who gives children to living beings and also
protects them. For one year from the birth of a child
this Devī should be worshipped. Those who cannot
afford it should worship Devī on the 6th or 21st day
after a child is born. (See Devasenā).
<div n="NI"/>(5) {%Maṅgalacaṇḍikā.%} She is born from the face of
Mūlaprakṛti. Anybody who propitiates and pleases
her will be the recipient of all good things like sons and
grandsons, wealth, reputation, welfare etc. (See Maṅ-
galacaṇḍikā).
<div n="NI"/>(6) {%Bhūmidevī.%} She is the basis for all things, soil for
the origin of the vegetable kingdom, the treasure
house of all gems and the very incarnation of compas-
sion and sympathy. (See Bhūmidevī).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Aṃśakalādevī(s).%} Another class of devīs who are
also partial manifestations of the Supreme Devī. They
are born out of the parts of Mahādevī. The following
are the Aṃśakalādevīs.
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Svāhādevī.%} Consort of Agni Bhagavān (Fire God).
Svāhā is worshipped in all the worlds. If havis (obla-
tion) is offered without repeating her name the Devas
will not accept it.
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Dakṣiṇādevī.%} Wife of Yajñadeva, this Devī is wor-
shipped by all. Without this Devī all Karmans (actions)
in the world will become futile.
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%Dīkṣādevī.%} Wife of Yajñadeva, this Devī is worshipp-
ed by all.
<Poem>Dīyate vimalaṃ jñānam
Kṣīyate karmavāsanā /
Tena dīkṣeti sā proktā.</Poem>
The Devī grants pure knowledge.
<div n="NI"/>(4) {%Svadhādevī.%} Wife of the Pitṛs, worshipped by manes
and men. Offerings made to the Pitṛs without honour-
ing this Devī will prove to be futile.
<div n="NI"/>(5) {%Svastidevī.%} Consort of the Vāyu. When offering Dakṣiṇā
and making divya-dāna (divine gifts) if ‘Svasti’ (may
good happen) is not uttered the gifts will be of no use.
<div n="NI"/>(6) {%Puṣṭidevī.%} Wife of Gaṇapati. If this Devī ceased to
exist men and women would become feeble, because
she is the source of all strength.
<div n="NI"/>(7) {%Tuṣṭidevī.%} Consort of Ananta worshipped by every-
body. If the Devī ceased to exist there would be no
happiness in the world.
<div n="NI"/>(8) {%Sampatti devī.%} Wife of Īśāna. Worshipped by Devas
and men. If the Devī ceased to exist the whole world
would become poor and indigent.
<div n="NI"/>(9) {%Dhṛti.%} Consort of Kapila. Everybody worships her
[Page218-a+ 64]
all the time. If the Devī ceased to exist the whole world
would become timid and cowardly.
<div n="NI"/>(10) {%Satīdevī.%} Wife of Satya. Well-wisher of all, this
Devī is worshipped by muktas. (people released from
worldly attachments). If the Devī ceased to exist there
would be no friendship and amity between people.
<div n="NI"/>(11) {%Dayādevī.%} Wife of Moha. If the Devī ceased to
exist the world would become hellish and a fierce battle
field.
<div n="NI"/>(12) {%Pratiṣṭhādevī.%} Wife of Puṇya. In the absence of
this Devī, who grants good and happy results to people's
actions the whole world would become as though it
were dead.
<div n="NI"/>(13) {%Siddhadevī.%}
<div n="NI"/>(14) {%Kīrtidevī.%} Both the Devīs, Siddhā and Kīrti are
wives of Sukarmā. If they ceased to exist the whole
world would be bereft of reputation and become lifeless
like a dead body.
<div n="NI"/>(15) {%Kriyādevī.%} Wife of Udyoga. If she ceased to exist
the whole world would become inactive and cease to
function.
<div n="NI"/>(16) {%Mithyāḍevī.%} Wife of Adharma. Wayward and
characterless people worship this Devī. If the Devī
ceased to exist the whole world as evolved by Brahmā
would cease to exist. This Devī was not seen anywhere
in the world during Kṛtayuga. She began to appear
in a subtle form here and there during Tretāyuga. In
dvāparayuga she attained more growth and then her
limbs and organs became doubly strong. In Kaliyuga
she developed to her full stature and growth and goes
about everywhere with her brother, Cheat (Kapaṭa).
<div n="NI"/>(17) {%Śāntidevī.%} (see below).
<div n="NI"/>(18) {%Lajjādevī.%} Both the Devīs, Śānti and Lajjā are good-
natured wives. If they ceased to exist the world would
become dull and sleepy.
<div n="NI"/>(19-20-21) {%Buddhidevī, Medhādevī%} and {%Dhṛtidevī.%} These
three Devīs are wives of Jñāna. If they ceased to exist
the world would become steeped in ignorance and
foolishness.
<div n="NI"/>(22) {%Mūrti.%} Wife of Dharma. She is very beautiful and
effulgent. In her absence the universal soul would be-
come devoid of vitality, helpless and meaningless.
<div n="NI"/>(23) {%Śrīdevī.%} Wife of Mālī. Her absence will make the
world lifeless.
<div n="NI"/>(24) {%Nidrādevī.%} Wife of Kālāgni. The Devī, a sage
who has attained realisation, affects everybody in the
world during night and makes them lose consciousness
and plunges them in sleep. In the absence of this Devī
the world will become a lunatic asylum.
<div n="NI"/>(25-26-27) {%Rātrī, Sandhyā%} and {%Divasā.%} These three are the
wives of Time (Kāla). In their absence nobody would
have any sense of time and none would be able to cal-
culate and fix time.
<div n="NI"/>(28-29) {%Viśappu%} and {%Dāham.%} Viśappu = hunger.
Dāham = thirst. These two Devīs are the wives of
greed (Lobha). They go about the world affecting
people and thus making them worried and miserable.
<div n="NI"/>(30-31) {%Prabhādevī%} and {%Dāhikā devī%} are the wives of
Tejas (Vitality). Without them Īśvara will find it im-
possible to continue the function of creation.
<div n="NI"/>(32-33) {%Mṛtyu%} and {%Jarā%} are the consorts of Prakṛṣṭa-
jvara and daughters of Kāla. And, if they cease to exist,
Brahmā's creation would also cease. (For Brahmā's
creation individual souls with the will for action are
[Page218-b+ 65]
necessary. He cannot create a soul of his own. So
death is a pre-condition of creation, birth. If there is
no death there is no birth also. There is a school of
thought which maintains that if there is no death but
only birth there will not be space on earth for the living,
and therefore birth will stop if there is no death.).
<div n="NI"/>(34-35) {%Tandrā%} and {%Prīti%} are the daughters of Nidrā and
consorts of Sukha (pleasure, happiness). These Devīs go
around the world on the orders of Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>(36-37) {%Śraddhā%} and {%Bhakti%} are the consorts of Vairāgya
(aversion to wordly comforts, renunciation) and they
give salvation to the souls of the people in the world.
<div n="NI"/>Aditi, mother of the Devas, Diti, mother of the Asuras,
Surabhi, mother of cows, Kadrū, mother of serpents
and Vinatā, mother of Garuḍas are also involved in the
process of creation, and they are born out of parts of
Devī.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Idol of Devī.%} There are special injunctions for mak-
ing idols of the Devī for installation in temples. Caṇḍi-
kādevī should have twenty hands. The hands on the
right side should hold Śūla, sword, disc, cord,
ḍamaru, śakti etc. and the hands on the left side should
hold nāgapāśa, flag, club, mirror etc. (There are also
idols with slight differences from the above).
<div n="NI"/>Lakṣmīdevī would hold in her right hand the lotus
flower and a Kūvala fruit in the left. Sarasvatīdevī will
have in her hands books, akṣamālā and vīṇā. Gaṅgādevī
rides on a makaramatsya (fish) holding in her hands
a pot and lotus flowers. Yamunādevī rides the turtle
with a pot in hand and she is blue in colour.
<div n="NI"/>Now, about the saptamātṛs. Tumburu, white in colour,
and mounted on an ox rests on a śūla with vīṇā in hand
before the Mātṛs. Among the Mātṛs Brāhmī has four
faces, wears the akṣamālā and holds the akṣapātra etc.
in her left hand. She is seated on a swan. Śāṅkarī
(Māheśvarī) is white in colour. She has in her right
hand bow and arrows, and the disc and bow in her left
hand. The ox is her vehicle. Kaumārī is seated on the
peacock. She has two hands in one of which is held
Śakti (Vel). Lakṣmī has in her right hand the conch
and disc, and the club and the lotus flower in her left
hand. Vārāhī rides the buffalo with staff, sword, club
and conch in her hands. Indrāṇī is seated on the club,
holding diamond in her hands. She has a thousand
eyes. Cāmuṇḍī has three eyes and is without flesh in the
body. Her hairs are raised above. She holds in her left
hand elephant's skin and śūla in the right hand. At
times she is seated on a corpse also.
<div n="NI"/>Now, about the idols of the eight Aṃbās. Rudra Carc-
cikā holds a skull, Śūla and cord in her hands. She
wears elephant's skin, her legs slightly held up. She
becomes Rudracāmuṇḍā when she assumes eight hands,
and holds the skull and the ḍamaru. And in dancing
pose she is called Naṭeśvarī, and with four faces Mahāl-
akṣmī. She is called Siddhacāmuṇḍā when she assumes
the form with ten hands and three eyes, and when she
eats men, horses and buffaloes. In this form she holds
in her right hand the sword, ḍamaru etc. and in her
left hand the Triśūla, bell etc. Since the Devī is sarva-
siddhipradāyikā (giver of all divine attainments or
assets) she is Siddhayogeśvarī also. There is also an-
other Devī in this very form who holds the pāśa and
Aṃkuśa in her hand and who is slightly red in colour.
She is called Bhairavī. When Bhairavī assumes the
form with twelve hands she is called Rūpavidyā. All the
[Page219-a+ 64]
above eight Devīs were born in burial grounds and are
Raudramūrtis. They are known as the Aṣṭāmbās.
