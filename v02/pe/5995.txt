SĀLAGRĀMA¦. A stone emblem of Viṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin of the name.%} Sālagrāma is the kind of
ammonite, used for making the image of Viṣṇu.
Mahāviṣṇu is known by the name Sālagrāma also.
This name originated from the name Sālagrāma,
which is the name of the place from where the river
Gaṇḍakī, which flows through Nepal, starts. This
Sālagrāma is considered to be a holy place. Mahāviṣṇu
and other gods always dwell in this place. Sālagrāma
is the name of Viṣṇu who dwells in Sālagrāma. (M.B.
Vana Parva, Chapter 84, Stanzas 123 to 125).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The importance of Sālagrāma.%} The place Sālagrāma
is at the origin of river Gaṇḍakī. There are various
kinds of stone figures which are called Sālagrāmas.
These Sālagrāmas themselves have originated from
portions of Viṣṇu. That is why those stones are used
for making images of Viṣṇu. There is a story in the
Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 9, stating that the derivation
of these stones is from a portion of Viṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>During the early days, Sarasvatī, Lakṣmī and Gaṅgā
were wives of Mahāviṣṇu. One day there arose a family
quarrel among them. (See under Tulasī). As a result
of this quarrel, the Devīs cursed each other. Sarasvatī
cursed Lakṣmī and changed her to holy basil plant
(Tulasī) on the earth. When Lakṣmī was about to
depart as Tulasī, Mahāviṣṇu blessed her thus. “Look!
Lakṣmī! you will live in the world as a holy basil and
when the curse has been completed you will come back
to me. On that day, a river named Gaṇḍakī, will start
from your body which will be in the shape of the holy
basil plant. (It is also said that the river Gaṇḍakī
has taken birth from the sweat of Śiva and Viṣṇu.
Refer to the word Gaṇḍakī). On the bank of that
river, I will remain as a stone image. There will be so
many worms with strong tusks and teeth, which will pierce
the stone into the shape of Sudarśana cakra (the weapon
of Viṣṇu) and will create numberless Sālagrāmas. The
Sālagrāmas thus made, will be of various sizes and
shapes.”
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Different classes of Sālagrāmas.%} Mention is made in
the Purāṇas about nineteen classes of Sālagrāmas. They
are given below:
[Page673-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Lakṣmīnārāyaṇa.%} With one hole, four cakras
(wheels) and Vanamālā (a line like the garland) and
of the colour of clouds.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Lakṣmījanārdana.%} This is the same as Lakṣmīnārā-
yaṇa, with the difference that there will be no
Vanamālā.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%Raghunātha.%} With two holes and four wheels and
mark of the hoof of a calf. This also will have no
Vanamālā.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%Vāmana.%} With two very small wheels and
the colour of the cloud. This too will have no
Vanamālā.
<div n="NI"/>(v) {%Śrīdhara.%} This is the same as Vāmana with the
exception that it will be having Vanamālā. The house
in which this is placed will have a prosperity and well
being of its own.
<div n="NI"/>(vi) {%Dāmodara.%} Will be large and round with two
cakras (wheels) and with no Vanamālā.
<div n="NI"/>(vii) {%Raṇarāma.%} Neither too large nor too small, but of
medium size and round, with two wheels and the
marks of child's kick, bow and quiver.
<div n="NI"/>(viii) {%Rājarājeśvara.%} Of the size of Raṇarāma with
seven cakras, (wheels), ornamented with the mark of
umbrella. This will earn for the possessor kingly
wealth.
<div n="NI"/>(ix) {%Ananta.%} Somewhat thick with fourteen wheels,
and as black as a cloud. This Sālagrāma will give men
the four Puruṣārthas (objects of life) ‘Dharmārtha-
kārnamokṣa’ (Duty, wealth, desire and salvation).
<div n="NI"/>(x) {%Madhusūdana.%} A sālagrāma in the shape of a wheel
with two wheels, and impression of cow's hoof,
having the shade of cloud, of ordinary size. This will
be very bright.
<div n="NI"/>(xi) {%Sudarśana.%} Sudarśana will have only one cakra
(wheel).
<div n="NI"/>(xii) {%Gadādhara.%} This also will be having only one
wheel which will not be bright.
<div n="NI"/>(xiii) {%Hayagrīva.%} This will have two wheels and the face
of a horse.
<div n="NI"/>(xiv) {%Nārasiṃha.%} With a very wide mouth, two wheels,
and awful shape. This Sālagrāma will cause instant
self-renunciation.
<div n="NI"/>(xv) {%Lakṣmīnarasiṃha.%} This also will be having a wide
mouth and two wheels. Besides these, there will be the
Vanamālā also. This will make house-holders cosy
and comfortable.
<div n="NI"/>(xvi) {%Vāsudeva.%} The Sālagrāma with two wheels at
the region of the hole and with round shape having
vividness and brightness, is Vāsudeva. This will grant
all desires.
<div n="NI"/>(xvii) {%Pradyumna.%} This will have only a minute wheel.
The colour will be that of clouds. But on the outer
side, there will be a hole in the inside of which there
will be a number of cuts or dents. This will give house-
holders comfort always.
<div n="NI"/>(xviii) {%Saṅkarṣaṇa.%} In the Saṅkarṣaṇa two wheels
will be joined face to face. The fore-part will be thin-
ner than the hind-part. This also will do good to
house-holders.
<div n="NI"/>(xix) {%Aniruddha.%} The colour of this is yellow. This
will be quite round and bright. This also will give
comfort to the house-holder. (Devī Bhāgavata,
Skandha 9; Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 46).
<div n="NI"/>4). {%The greatness of Sālagrāma.%} Of these, the stones
with cakras (the weapon Discus), are Bhagavān Viṣṇu
[Page673-b+ 64]
in reality. Those who worship this stone with mark of
cakra, need not have to take another birth. He who
habitually worships Sālagrāma, should avoid arro-
gance and should be charitable. He who worships
Sālagrāma with the mark of wheel should not covet
others' wealth and women. The cakra from Dvārakā
and the stone from Gaṇḍakī will bring atonement in
a moment for sins incurred in a hundred births. Even
if one has incurred thousands of sins, one will get remis-
sion for all of them by drinking the water of Sālagrāma.
Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya, Vaiśya and Śūdra will attain
heaven if they become house-holders according to
Vedic convention and worship Sālagrāma. On no
account should women worship Sālagrāma. If by
ignorance, a woman, whether she is good-natured or of
a higher status, happens to touch Sālagrāma, all her
merits earned by good deeds will be lost and she will
go to hell. Brahmin sages say that women throwing
flowers as oblation on Sālagrāma, commit the greatest
sin. If a woman touches a Sālagrāma, the offering of
Sandal-wood will be like poisoned rice, flowers like
diamond, and meals presented to god before being
eaten by the servants in the temple, will be like Kāla-
kūṭa (the poison of Vāsuki), to Bhagavān Viṣṇu. If
a woman touches Sālagrāma, she will have to remain
in hell for the duration of fourteen Indras. Even the
sin of Brahmahatyā (killing a brahmin) will be remit-
ted by drinking the water of Sālagrāma and he will
attain heaven. Basil (tulasī) sandalwood, water, conch
tinkling bell, wheel, stone, copper pot, and name of
Viṣṇu comprise ‘Padāmṛta’ (the celestial nectar of
words) which is said to have the power of remit-
ting sins. The merits obtained by bathing in all
the tīrthas and the performing of all the yāgas (sacri-
fices) dwell in each drop of water of Sālagrāma.
(Padma Purāṇa, Pātāla Khaṇḍa, Chapter 20).
