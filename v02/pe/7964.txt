VĀLMĪKI I¦. A hermit who was the first among poets
and the author of Rāmāyaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Knowledge about this hermit
who was the first among the poets of Bhārata, is scanty.
So we have to depend mainly on some hearsay for the
life history of this sage.
<div n="NI"/>It is said that Vālmīki was the tenth son of Varuṇa. But
in his younger age he fell into the hands of wicked
people and became a wicked man, like his friends. Then
his name was not Vālmīki. Being a father, he had to
support his family. For this purpose he used to plunder
travellers. Once he happened to catch the Saptarṣis
(the seven hermits) who passed by that way. The
hermits asked him whether his wife and children would
share the sins he had incurred by plundering. The
plunderer could not answer that unexpected question.
He ran home and asked his wife and children if they
would share the sins incurred by him. They were not
prepared to do so. In a moment his life underwent a
thorough change. He ran to the Saptarṣis and knelt
before them. They imparted to the forester, knowledge
of the Vedas. The forester sat under a tree and began
to sing ‘Rāma Rāma.’ Days and months and years
passed, unknown to him. He did not know that white
ants had built a shelter above him. After several years
the Saptarṣis returned by that way. They broke the
[Page823-a+ 65]
ant-hill and took the hermit out. Because he came out
of Valmīka or white-ant-hill he came to be known as
Vālmīki. He built his hermitage on the bank of the
river Tamasā and lived there with his disciples. It was
at this place that he composed the famous poem Rāmā-
yaṇa. (For further details see under Rāmāyaṇa).
