ABHAYAM¦. King Idhmajihva divided his kingdom
Plakṣadvīpa into seven parts and gave them to his
seven sons. Abhayam is one of the parts. The other six
parts are:—Śivaṃ, Yamasaṃ, Subhadraṃ, Śāntaṃ,
Kṣemaṃ and Amṛtaṃ. See “Idhmajihva”. (Bhāgavata,
5th Skandha, Chapter 20, Verse 2). It is seen (from
M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 30, Verse 9) that the
territory known as Abhayam was conquered by
Bhīmasena. (See Foot-note)
