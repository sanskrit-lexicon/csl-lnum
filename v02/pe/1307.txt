BṚHADDHVAJA¦. A Rākṣasa (giant). This giant wan-
dered about stealing the wealth and women of others.
One day Bṛhaddhvaja happened to meet with Keśinī,
the beautiful wife of king Bhīmakeśa. The lustful giant
was about to take her away, when she told him
thus:—“I hate my husband very much. So I am
ready to come with you, of my own accord.”
<div n="NI"/>Taking her in his chariot the giant went to Gaṅgā-
sāgara saṅgama. When she learned that this place was
under the rule of her husband, she died of fear. Being
unable to bear separation from Keśinī, the giant also
died. As these two had died at the holy place of Gaṅgā-
sāgara saṅgama, both attained the world of Viṣṇu.
(Skanda Purāṇa, Kriyākāṇḍa).
