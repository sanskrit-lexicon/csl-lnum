HIRAṆYAPURAM¦. A city of the Daityas. The Daitya
woman, Pulomā got the city for her children by tapas.
Pulomā is called Kālakā also. (Certain Purāṇas aver
that Kālakā was the sister of Pulomā). The children of
Pulomā are known as Kālakeyas for whose safety and
security she did tapas for 1000 years. And, when
Brahmā asked her to choose any boon she desired,
Pulomā said as follows:- “There should arise no reason
or cause for my sons to feel sorrow in their life; Devas,
snakes or Rākṣasas should not kill them and they must
have a beautiful city to live in. Brahmā granted her all
the boons. Hiraṇyapura was built by Brahmā for the
Kālakeyas to live in. It was full of gems and it could
easily travel in the sky.
<div n="NI"/>When life became impossible for the Devas due to the
depredations of the Kālakeyas, Indra brought
Arjuna to Devaloka. As the Kālakeyas were granted the
boon that they would not be killed by the Devas,
Arjuna's help had thus to be sought by Indra. Arjuna
killed the Kālakeyas and destroyed Hiraṇyapura. (Vana
Parva, Chapter 173). On one occasion Nārada gave
a correct description of Hiraṇyapura to Mātali, the
charioteer of Indra. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 100).
