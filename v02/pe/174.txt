ALARKA II¦. A king of the states of Kāśī and Karūṣa.
He was a very honest man. Forsaking all riches and his
kingdom he accepted Dharmamārga. (Śloka 64, Chap-
ter 115, Anuśāsana Parva, M.B.). He was a member of
[Page027-a+ 65]
the council of yama. He attained salvation by yoga and
meditation. (18th Śloka, Chapter 8, Sabhā Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>Once Alarka decided to overcome the five senses. To
control them he sent arrows at the mind, nose, tongue,
ear, eye, skin and intelligence. But the senses never
surrendered to them. Then Alarka by sheer dhyāna
and yoga brought them under control. (M.B., Anu-
śāsana Parva, Chapter 30).
<div n="NI"/>Alarka once told a blind brahmin boy to ask for any boon
from him. The boy demanded the eyes of Alarka. To
keep his promise Alarka scooped out his eyes and gave
them to the blind boy. (Rāmāyaṇa, Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa,
Sarga 12, Śloka 43).
