PHALGUTANTRA¦. The father of Sagara. During the
old age of Phalgutantra the Haihayas led by Tāla-
jaṅghas attacked Ayodhyā and drove out the royal
family from the palace. Phalgutantra fled from the
palace with his wife and stayed in the āśrama of Aurva.
The King died before long. The queen who was preg-
nant then delivered a son in due course and he became
the celebrated Sagara. (Chapter 3, Brahmāṇḍa
Purāṇa).
