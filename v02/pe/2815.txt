Ṛkṣa was born from Dhūminī, Duṣyanta and Para-
meṣṭhi from Nīlī and Jahnu from Keśinī. The descen-
dants of Jahnu are called the Kuśikas. Jahnu handed
over his kingdom to his son Balākāśva and went to
perform penance. Kuśika was the son of Balākāśva.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Drank up the river Ganges.%} The river Gaṅgā, which
flowed through the earth in accordance with the
request of Bhagīratha, submerged the hermitage of
Jahnu. Jahnu became angry at this haughtiness of
Gaṅgā and drank up the river, but at the entreaty of
Bhagīratha pushed Gaṅgādevī out through his ear.
(See under Gaṅgā). From that day onwards Gaṅgā
got the name Jāhnavī.
