SUVARṆATĪRTHA¦. A very ancient holy spot in
India. Before creation Mahāviṣṇu once did penance
here to please Rudra who appeared before him and
granted him boons. That is the great importance of
the place. He who worships Śiva here will derive
benefits equal to those of conducting an Aśvamedha
yajña and also will attain the status of Gaṇapati.
(Vana Parva, Chapter 84, Verse 18).
