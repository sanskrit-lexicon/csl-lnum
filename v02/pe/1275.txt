BRAHMASARAS¦. A holy place in Dharmāraṇya. If a
man fasts in this holy place for one night, he would
reach the world of Brahmā. In this holy place there is
a peg driven down by Brahmā himself. One who walks
round this peg will attain the fruits of performing a
Vājapeya yajña (a drinking sacrifice). There is another
holy bath of the name Brahmasaras in Gayā. (M.B.
Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 25, Stanza 89).
