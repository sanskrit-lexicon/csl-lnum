<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} There is a story about his birth in the Rāmā-
yaṇa. Once there was a king called Sagara in Ayodhyā.
He married two women named Keśinī and Sumati. For
[Page057-b+ 64]
a long time they had no sons and so they went to the
Himālayas and started penance there in the mount of
Bhṛguprasravaṇa. After a hundred years Bhṛgumaha-
rṣi appeared before them and pleased them thus: “Your
elder wife Keśinī will give birth to a son who will
continue your dynasty and your second wife will give
birth to sixty thousand children”. After a few years
Keśinī gave birth to Asamañjas and Sumati to a big
ball of flesh. That ball broke and sixty thousand babes
came out from it. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa,
Sarga 83).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Character of Asamañjas.%} He was a very cruel man
always tormenting people. He used to throw little child-
ren into the Sarayū river and stand on the banks of the
river enjoying the sight of the children dying drowning.
People hated him. His father, therefore, drove him out
of his palace. To this bad man was born Aṃśumān, a
King who became the favourite of the people. (Vāl-
mīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, Sarga 38).
