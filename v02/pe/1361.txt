BUDHA IV¦. A Brāhmaṇa who lived in Gauḍadeśa.
Budha who was the incarnation of all vices drank too
much and spent a whole night lying unconscious on
the veranda of the house of a harlot. His father became
anxious about him as he had not returned though the
night had advanced much. He searched everywhere
and finally came to the place where he was lying un-
conscious. He reviled the son, who getting angry
killed his father then and there.
<div n="NI"/>After that he returned home. His mother advised him
to leave off his vices. His wife shed tears before him.
Seeing that his mother and wife were impediments
on his way, he put an end to their lives.
<div n="NI"/>Once this Brāhmaṇa carried away Sulabhā the beauti-
ful wife of hermit Kālabhūti and ravished her. Sulabhā
cursed him and made him a leper.
<div n="NI"/>Budha wandered about and reached the city of King
Śūrasena. On that day the King was about to go to
Heaven with the entire city by aeroplane. However
hard the pilots might try the plane would not move an
inch. Then the devas told the King: “Drive away
the leper there. The vices of that sinful murderer
have made the plane stationary.”
<div n="NI"/>Śūrasena who was kind and righteous, neared the leper
and cured him with caturākṣarīmantra (a spell of four
letters) and got ready to take him also to heaven.
(Gaṇeśa Purāṇa 1:76).
