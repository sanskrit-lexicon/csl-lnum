PURĀṆA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} The Amarakośa describes a
Purāṇa thus:
<Poem>Sargaśca pratisargaśca
Vaṃśo manvantarāṇi ca /
Vaṃśānucaritaṃ cāpi
Purāṇam pañcalakṣaṇam //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>According to this definition, Purāṇa is one which des-
cribes Sarga, Pratisarga, Vaṃśa, Manvantara and
Vaṃśānucarita. Among these Sarga and Pratisarga
are natural creation and renovation (Cosmogony).
Vaṃśa means history of sages and patriarchs. By Man-
vantara is meant the period of different Manus. Vaṃśā-
nucarita means Genealogy of kings. In the Purāṇas
which are current now some of these five divisions are
wanting.
<div n="NI"/>Statements about Purāṇas are found even in the
Brāhmaṇas. Therefore it is to be surmised that Purāṇas
existed even before historic times. Mahābhārata has
used the term Purāṇa to mean stories about devas and
siddhas. The Upaniṣads say that Purāṇas are itihāsas
and as such constitute the fifth Veda. Smṛti says
that Purāṇas are commentaries on Vedas. From all
these statements it can be gathered that Purāṇas have
a hoary past. The great Sanskrit scholar Raṅgācārya
has defined Purāṇa as Purā nava (Purā=old; nava
=new) meaning things which are as good as new
though existing from olden times. Though there are
large portions of wide imagination dealing with the
human side in the Purāṇas many truths about the
universe can be grasped from them. All the Purāṇas
contain praises of Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśvara. In
most of the Purāṇas of old, new additions and interpo-
lations are seen. The Purāṇas in original were in exis-
tence before Christ.
<Poem>Ākhyānaiścāpyupākhyānair
Gāthābhiḥ Kalpaśuddhibhiḥ /
Purāṇasaṃhitāṃ cakre
Purāṇārthaviśāradaḥ //</Poem>
(Śloka 15, Chapter 6, Aṃśa 3, Viṣṇu Purāṇa)
<Poem>Aṣṭādaśa Purāṇāni
Kṛtvā Satyavatīsutaḥ /
Bhāratākhyānamakhilaṃ
Cakre tadupabṛṃhaṇam //</Poem>
(Śloka 70, Chapter 53, Matsya Purāṇa)
<div n="NI"/>From the above it can be gathered that it was Vyāsa
who composed all the Purāṇas. Bāṇa who lived in the
seventh century A.D. speaks about Vāyu Purāṇa. Kumā-
rila Bhaṭṭa who lived in the eighth century and Śaṅkarā-
cārya who lived in the ninth century speak about the
Purāṇas. Purāṇas must have therefore taken their pre-
sent forms before the sixth or seventh century A.D.
<div n="NI"/>There are eighteen major Purāṇas and another eighteen
minor ones. The major Purāṇas contain over four lakhs
of Ślokas. All the Purāṇas are in verses like Mahā-
bhārata. But none of them is as good as Mahābhārata
as a piece of literature. Still the Purāṇas splendidly
reflect the culture of Bhārata. The Purāṇas are the
basis of the bulk of Indian thinking on matters
social, cultural, religious and political. Even the Indian
art has taken form from the Purāṇas. The Purāṇas are
classified into three, those pertaining to Brahmā, those
pertaining to Viṣṇu and those to Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%A. Viṣṇu-based Purānas.%}
[Page617-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Viṣṇu Purāṇa.%} This is one of the most important of
all the Purāṇas. This contains the five technical
divisions of the Purāṇas. This is divided into six aṃśas.
This deals with the events of Vārāhakalpa and contains
twentythree thousand ślokas. The theme is the ten
incarnations of Mahāviṣṇu. Viṣṇu Purāṇa is the most
ancient of all the Purāṇas and has got the name
Purāṇaratna (gem of Purāṇas).
<div n="NI"/>The method of narration is in the form of teaching
his disciple Maitreya by sage Parāśara. Since
there is a reference in it to the Maurya dynasty it is to
be surmised that this was composed in the first or second
century A.D. The narrator himself states thus:—
“Vyāsa an adept in the composition of Purāṇas composed
this Purāṇasaṃhitā with ākhyānas, Upākhyānas, gāthās
and Kalpanirṇayas. A Sūta named Romaharṣaṇa was
Vyāsa's chief disciple. The broad-minded Vyāsa gave
that saṃhitā to that sūta. Romaharṣaṇa had six dis-
ciples named Sumati, Agnivarcas, Mitrāyus. Śāṃśapā-
yana, Akṛtavraṇa, and Sāvarṇi. Of these Akṛtavraṇa,
Sāvarṇi and Śāṃśapāyana born in the Kaśyapagotra
have composed Purāṇasaṃhitās. There is yet another
saṃhitā composed by Romaharṣaṇa which was the basis
of the saṃhitās of his three disciples. I have composed
Viṣṇupurāṇa basing on the above four saṃhitās.”
<div n="NI"/>If a man gives as gift a book of Viṣṇu Purāṇa on
the full moon day in the month of āṣāḍha (July) with
Jaladhenu he will attain Viṣṇupāda.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Bhāgavata Purāṇa.%} This is the most popular and
widely circulated of all the Purāṇas. It is dear to
Viṣṇu-devotees. Divided into twelve Skandhas this con-
tains eighteen thousand ślokas. All the incarnations of
Viṣṇu are described in this. The most interesting
Skandha is the tenth Skandha in which the author has
described the life and activities of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. There
was once a belief that it was Baladeva who lived in the
thirteenth century A.D. that had composed this Purāṇa.
But this belief was smashed when it was found that Vallā-
lasena of Bengal who lived in the eleventh century A.D.
had made references to this Purāṇa in some of his works.
Bhāgavata accepts Kapila and Buddha as incarnations
of Viṣṇu. This has been translated into all Indian
languages. This book has to be given as gift on the full-
moon day in the month of Proṣṭhapada (September).
Agni Purāṇa instructs that this book is to be given
along with a golden image of a lion.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%Nāradīya Purāṇa.%} This is in the form of a
narration by Nārada to Sanatkumāra. In this book of
twentyfive thousand verses Nārada teaches the dharmas
of Bṛhatkalpa. If this is given as gift on the full-moon
day in the month of Āśvina there will be great pros-
perity.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%Garuḍa Purāṇa.%} This is in the form of instructions
to Garuḍa by Viṣṇu. This deals with astronomy,
medicine, grammar, and with the structure and qualities
of diamonds. This Purāṇa is dear to Vaiṣṇavites. The
latter half of this Purāṇa deals with life after death.
The Hindus of north-India generally read this Purāṇa
while cremating the bodies of the dead. This has given
great importance to the origin of Garuḍa. There are
eight thousand verses in this book. This book should be
given as gift along with an image in gold of a swan to
get prosperity.
<div n="NI"/>(v) {%Padma Purāṇa (Pādma Purāṇa).%} This book is
divided into six Khaṇḍas comprising fiftyfive thousand
[Page618-a+ 64]
verses. The six Khaṇḍas are Sṛṣṭikhaṇḍa, Bhūmi-
khaṇḍa, Svargakhaṇḍa, Pātālakhaṇḍa, Uttarakhaṇḍa
and Kriyāyogasāra. The Uttarakhaṇḍa describes
the importance of all months and also the lotus, the
seat of Brahmā. This contains the stories of Śakuntalā
and Śrī Rāma as described by Kālidāsa in his works
Śākuntala and Raghuvaṃśa which has made some
believe that this Purāṇa was written after Kālidāsa.
If this Purāṇa is given as gift with a cow in the month
of Jyeṣṭha (June) it brings prosperity.
<div n="NI"/>(vi) {%Varāha Purāṇa.%} The mode of narration is in the
form of narrating the story by Varāha, the third incar-
nation of Viṣṇu. The theme is about holy places and
mantras. It states that the goddess of earth prayed to
Mahāviṣṇu and that prayer took the form of a goddess.
This book contains fourteen thousand verses. If one
copies down this Purāṇa and gives it as gift along with
a golden image of Garuḍa on the full-moon day in the
month of Caitra (April) one will attain Viṣṇuloka.
<div n="NI"/>{%B. Purāṇas relating to Brahmā.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Brahma Purāṇa.%} This is in the form of teachings by
Brahmā to Dakṣa. This contains twentyfive thousand
verses. This is called Ādi Purāṇa also. There is a special
treatise in this book on Orissa, an ancient holy region
of Bhārata. There is in this a special annexure explain-
ing the intimacy between Śiva and Sūrya which is a
deviation from other Purāṇas. Brahma Purāṇa states
about a sūryakṣetra (sun-temple) situated at a place
called Koṇārka near the holy place of Purī, installed
there in the year 1241 A.D. If this Purāṇa along with
Jaladhenu is given as a gift on the full-moon day in the
month of Vaiśākha (May) the donor will attain heaven.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa.%} This deals with the origin of
the universe as told by Brahmā. In the beginning
there was a golden egg and the prapañca (universe with
its activities) was formed out of it. Portions of Adh-
yātma Rāmāyaṇa, references to Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa and
the incarnation of Paraśurāma are included in this.
This book contains twelve thousand verses and it is
believed to be uttama (best) to give this book as a gift
to a brahmin.
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%Brahmavaivarta Purāṇa.%} This was instructed to
Sāvarṇika by Nārada. The theme is the story of
Rathantara. There are four kāṇḍas in this Purāṇa called
Brahmakāṇḍa, Prakṛtikāṇḍa, Gaṇeśakāṇḍa and Kṛṣṇa-
janmakāṇḍa. This deals with Prapañcasṛṣṭi (creation
of the universe). It says that Prapañca is nothing
but the Vaivartta (transformation) of Brahman. It is
considered to be holy to give this book containing eighteen
thousand verses as a gift on the full-moon day in the
month of Māgha (February).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa.%} This is one of the ancient
Purāṇas. There are many stories regarding Indra,
Sūrya and Agni in this. This includes a division called
Devīmāhātmya containing praises about the goddess
Durgā. This contains nine thousand verses and it is
considered as uttama (best) to give this book as a gift
to a brahmin on a full-moon day in the month of
Kārttika (November).
<div n="NI"/>(v) {%Bhaviṣya Purāṇa.%} This is what is told to Manu by
Sūrya (Sun). This contains statements about future
events. The book praises the worship of Sūrya (Sun),
Agni (fire) and Nāga (serpent). There is an annexure
dealing with the several holy places of Bhārata and the
[Page618-b+ 65]
rights of pilgrims. The book contains fourteen thousand
verses and it is considered to be uttama (best) to give
this book along with treacle as a gift to a brahmin on
the full-moon day in the month of Pauṣa (January).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) {%Vāmana Purāṇa.%} There is a great similarity between
the contents of this Purāṇa and that of Varāha Purāṇa.
All the incarnations of Viṣṇu from Vāmana downwards
are described in this Purāṇa. The scene of Śiva marry-
ing Pārvatī is vividly described in this book. This
Purāṇa contains ten thousand verses and it is considered
to be uttama (best) to give this book as a gift in the
autumn season or at the time of Viṣuva to a brahmin.
<div n="NI"/>{%C. Purāṇas relating to Śiva.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Vāyu Purāṇa.%} This Purāṇa is told by Vāyu. Bāṇa-
bhaṭṭa who lived in the seventh century A.D. makes
references to this Purāṇa in his works. There are many
references in this Purāṇa about the Gupta Kings who
ruled Bhārata in the 4th century A.D. So it is believed
that this Purāṇa must have been written in the fifth or
sixth century A.D The book contains plenty of verses
in praise of Śiva. There are fourteen thousand verses in
the Vāyu Purāṇa and it is considered to be best to give
this book as a gift to a brahmin on the full-moon day
in the month of Śrāvaṇa (August).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) {%Liṅga Purāṇa.%} This contains instructions of Śiva on
Dharma sitting in the form of liṅga (Phallus). The

<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%Skānda Purāṇa.%} This Purāṇa is narrated by
Skanda. The theme is the slaughter of the demon
Tārakāsura by Skanda (Subrahmaṇya). There is a
great similarity between this Purāṇa and the Kumāra-
sambhava of Kālidāsa. There are eightyfour thousand
verses in this Purāṇa and giving this book as a gift is
thought to be good.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) {%Agni Purāṇa.%} This Purāṇa was instructed to the
sage Vasiṣṭha by Agnideva. There are several refer-
ences in this to Śivaliṅga and Durgādevī. The incarna-

Distinct from other Purāṇas this book deals with arts
and science like Kavyālaṅkāranāṭakas (Poems, dramas,
figures of speech), Jyotiśsāstra (Astronomy) and Śilpa-
kalā (architecture). This Purāṇa contains twelve
thousand verses and is capable of imparting knowledge
on all arts and sciences.
