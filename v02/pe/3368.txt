KĀRTAVĪRYĀRJUNA¦ (KĀRTAVĪRYA). A renowned
King of the Hehaya dynasty.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} From Mahāviṣṇu were descended in the
following order: Brahmā—Atri—Candra—Budha—Purū-
ravas—Āyus—Yayāti—Yadu—Sahasrajit—Śatajit—
Ekavīra—(Hehaya)—Dharma—Kaṇi—Bhadrasena—
Dhanaka—Kṛtavīrya—Kārtavīryārjuna.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Hehaya Dynasty and Bhārgava Dynasty.%} The Hehayas
were Kṣatriyas and the Bhārgavas were Brāhmaṇas.
The Bhārgava sages were the family preceptors of the
Hehaya Kings. The Hehayas who were generous and
charitable, used to give plenty of wealth to the Bhārga-
vas. Consequently in course of time, the Bhārgavas
grew wealthy while the Hehayas gradually declined. In
order to tide over their difficulty, the Hehayas decided
to borrow some money from the Bhārgavas. But the
Bhārgavas refused to oblige, on the plea that they had
no money. The enraged Kṣatriyas (Hehayas) began to
persecute the Bhṛgus (Bhārgavas). The Bhṛgus left for
the Himālayas after burying all their treasures under
the floor of their Āśramas. The Kṣatriyas pursued
them and hunted them even there. At last a Brāhmaṇī
who belonged to the Bhārgava race, gave birth to a
sage named Aurva through her thigh. With his birth
the Hehayas began to lead a less aggressive life. After
the lapse of many years, the mighty Kārtavīryārjuna
was born in the Hehaya dynasty and the mighty sage
Jamadagni was born in the Bhṛgu dynasty. Both of
them nourished their hereditary feud. With his capital
in the city of Māhiṣmatī on the banks of the river
Narmadā, Kārtavīryārjuna began his reign. (See
under Aurva I).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Thousand Hands of Kārtavīryārjuna.%} Once when
Kārtavīryārjuna was living in his capital Māhiṣmatī,
the sage Nārada happened to come there. The King
greeted him with due reverence and asked him what
course of action was to be followed for attaining
mokṣa (salvation) and at the same time for enjoying
worldly pleasures. Nārada replied that by performing
the rite known as “Bhadradīpa Pratiṣṭhā”, both these
objects could be achieved. Accordingly, Kārtavīrya
went to the banks of the river Narmadā with his wife
[Page394-a+ 65]
and began the observance of Bhadradīpa Pratiṣṭhā.
Kārtavīrya's guru was Dattātreya, the son of Atri. At
the conclusion of the Yāga rites, Dattātreya who was
pleased, asked Kārtavīryārjuna what boons he wished
to have. Kārtavīrya with joined palms asked him many
boons one of which was that he should have a thousand
arms. Dattātreya granted him the boons, and Kārta-
vīrya who became proud of his new possession, ruled at
Māhiṣmatī for 86, 000 years. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa,
Chapter 44).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Vāyu's Warning.%} Kārtavīryārjuna who returned
triumphant after receiving the boon from Dattātreya
heard a mysterious voice warning him in the following
words:—“You fool! Don't you know that a Brāhmaṇa
is superior to a Kṣatriya? A Kṣatriya governs his
subjects in alliance with the Brāhmaṇa”. On hearing
this, Kārtavīrya became angry. He understood that
Vāyu, the divine messenger was behind the mysterious
voice. He despised Vāyu and argued that a Kṣatriya
was superior to a Brāhmaṇa. Vāyu gave him a warn-
ing that a Brāhmaṇa would curse Kārtavīrya. (M.B.
Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 152).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Kārtavīrya cursed by the sage.%} Once Agni (fire-god)
approached Kārtavīrya and begged for food. The King
allowed him to feed upon mountains and trees from any
part of his Kingdom. So Agni began to devour the
woods and hills. This led to the burning down of an
Āśrama owned by a sage called Āpava. The enraged
Sage came to know that Kārtavīryārjuna was respon-
sible for the havoc and pronounced a curse that Paraśu-
rāma would chop off all the thousand hands of Kārta-
vīryārjuna.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Kārtavīryārjuna and Rāvaṇa.%} In the course of his
triumphal march, after conquering the whole world,
Rāvaṇa once arrived with his forces on the bank of the
river Narmadā. Enjoying the smooth flow of the crystal
clear stream of the Narmadā and the pleasant sand
banks in the river-bed, he spent a night there with his
followers. Early next morning he took his bath in the
river and setting up the idol of Śiva on the sand bank,
began to worship it.
<div n="NI"/>Just then Kārtavīryārjuna and his wives came to the
place and began their water sports, a few yards down
the river from the place where Rāvaṇa was sitting. As
part of his amusements, Kārtavīrya stopped the flow of
the river by making a dam with his thousand arms.
This caused the level of the water to rise and Rāvaṇa
with his materials of worship was submerged in the
flood. Enraged at this disturbance to his worship, he
sent two of his men down the river bank to find out
what was happening. They traced the source of the
trouble to Kārtavīryārjuna and his water-sports and
reported the matter to their master. At once Rāvaṇa
armed himself with his bow rushed to Kārtavīryārjuna
and began a fierce fight. At last Rāvaṇa fell down under
the heavy stroke of Kārtavīrya's mace and was bound
in chains and imprisoned. He lay there for one year.
Rāvaṇa's father sage Pulastya came to know of this and
he went to Kārtavīrya's palace. He was received with
due respect and at his request, Kārtavīrya released
Rāvaṇa and after that they remained friends for life.
(Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Kārtavīrya and Reṇukā's Death.%} One day when
Paraśurāma was fourteen years old, his father sage
Jamadagni went to the forest to fetch some Samits
[Page394-b+ 65]
(sacrificial twigs). Jamadagni's wife, Reṇukā swept and
cleaned the Āśrama and went to the river Revā to fetch
water and Paraśurāma was left behind in the Āśrama.
When she reached the river bank, she saw Kārtavīryārjuna
indulging in amorous pleasures with his wives in the
water. She waited unobserved on the bank for some
time and after they had left the place, she stepped into
the river. But since the water was muddy, she had to
go to another place in the river to get clear water.
There also she lingered for a few minutes, looking at
the amorous amusements of Citraratha, King of Sālva,
with his wives. It was only after they had departed
that she was able to return to the Āśrama with water.
Meanwhile Jamadagni who had returned to the Āśrama
earlier was angry at her delay and was waiting impatient-
ly for her arrival. As soon as she reached the Āśrama,
the sage, in a fit of fury, ordered Paraśurāma to cut
off her head and the latter obeyed him. (Brahmāṇḍa
Purāṇa, Chapter 58).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%The Triumphal March of Kārtavīrya.%} All the Kings in
the world acknowledged the supremacy of Kārtavīrya.
In Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 16, we find that Kings
of the Solar dynasty like Trayyāruṇa, Hariścandra,
Rohitāśva and Cuñcu were defeated by Kārtavīryā-
rjuna. In his golden chariot he went about defeating
Devas, Yakṣas, Ṛṣis and others. He challenged even
Viṣṇu. He insulted Indra in the company of Indrāṇī.
(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 115).
<div n="NI"/>Intoxicated by his successes, Kārtavīrya went to the
sea-shore and challenged the ocean and began to des-
troy the animals in the sea by shooting them with his
arrows. God Varuṇa appeared before him and asked
him what he wanted. Kārtavīrya asked the god to
name a man who had the capacity to fight with him.
Varuṇa answered that Jamadagni's son Paraśurāma
was the person who satisfied that condition. Kārta-
vīrya accepted the challenge and went in search of
Paraśurāma. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 29).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Killing of Jamadagni.%} Once Kārtavīrya went to
hunt in the forest with his followers. They were roam-
ing in the Vindhya forests in search of game. At noon
after a refreshing bath in the clear waters of the river
Narmadā when they were preparing to return, they
saw Jamadagni's Āśrama. After asking his men to wait
at the river-bank, Kārtavīrya went alone to the
Āśrama. He paid his respects to the sage and after
their usual greetings, Jamadagni asked him to call his
followers also to the Āśrama. When all of them arrived
the sage gave them a sumptuous feast. Kārtavīrya
wondered how the sage managed to do it. They spent
the night there and when they returned home next
morning Kārtavīrya's minister Candragupta told him
that he saw a cow in Jamadagni's Āśrama and that it
was from that divine cow that the sage was able to get
all the rare articles of food which he supplied to the
guests. He also offered to get the cow from the sage.
So the King sent Candragupta to the Āśrama to beg
the cow from the sage for him. Candragupta accordingly
went with a few followers to the Āśrama and begged
for the cow. At that time Paraśurāma was not in the
Āśrama. Jamadagni told them that the cow was
Kāmadhenu's sister, Suśīlā and that it was not possible
to give her. Candragupta tried to seize the cow by
force but she suddenly vanished into the sky. The
King's men tried to capture her calf. Jamadagni who
[Page395-a+ 64]
came forward to prevent them, was beaten to death by
Candragupta. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapters 67 to
70).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Jamadagni's Restoration to Life.%} Paraśurāma
returned soon to the Āśrama with the disciple Akṛta-
vraṇa. At the sight of his father lying dead on the floor,
Paraśurāma cried aloud. Reṇukā beat her breast
twentyone times. Seeing this, Paraśurāma took a
solemn vow that he would go round the world twenty-
one times and extirpate the Kṣatriya Kings. The sage
Śukra appeared there with Suśīlā who had vanished.
After restoring Jamadagni to life Śukra went back.
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Death of Kārtavīryārjuna.%} Paraśu Rāma who had
turned himself into the very embodiment of Revenge,
accompanied by Akṛtavraṇa, took his stand at the gates
of the city of Māhiṣmatī and challenged Kārtavīr-
yārjuna to a fight. Kārtavīrya came out with a huge
army. In the terrible fight that followed, Paraśurāma
himself with his axe (paraśu) chopped off all the
thousand arms of Kārtavīryārjuna. All his sons were
killed. Kārtavīrya himself fell down beheaded. This
was the end of the pillar of Hehaya dynasty. (Brahmā-
ṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 81).
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Kārtavīrya's sons.%} Kārtavirya had one hundred
sons. All of them were killed in the battle by Paraśu-
rāma. Their names, as given in Chapter 76 of
