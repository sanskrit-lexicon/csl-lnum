CŪṬU¦. (Dice). It is an imaginative paurāṇic assump-
tion that there is a satanic force latent in dice, hunting,
wine and women. There is a story to support the pre-
sence of this evil power within the above four. Indra
once turned the Aśvinīdevas out of his court labelling
them as outcastes and banned wine to them. Discon-
tented at this the Aśvinīdevas approached Cyavana and
the latter performing a yāga invited the Aśvinīdevas and
gave them the yāga wine, ‘Soma’. Infuriated at this
Indra raised his celebrated Vajrāyudha (Weapon of
thunder) to kill Cyavana. But the sage by his yogic
powers paralysed the hands of Indra and instantly from
the sacrificial fire there arose Mada a genie to kill Indra.
Frightened by this sight Indra fell at the feet of Cyavana
and craved for pardon. The sage then tore the genie into
four pieces and threw one each into dice, hunting, wine
and women. That is why all the four are as alluring as
destructive. (Saptama Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
