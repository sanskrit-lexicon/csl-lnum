CERIPPU¦. (FOOTWEAR). There is a story in
Mahābhārata of how Cerippu and Kuṭa (footwear and
umbrella) were born. Once the heat of the Sun be-
came unbearable to Jamadagni and enraged at this
the sage started sending arrows against the Sun. His
wife Reṇukā was supplying him with arrows. When a
set of arrows was finished Reṇukā brought another set.
This continued without break and the Sun began to
feel the attack. Unable to do anything against the sage
the Sun heated the head and foot of Reṇukā on her way
to supply the arrows so fiercely that Reṇukā fell down
under a banyan tree exhausted. When she became well
enough to walk she took the arrows to her husband who
was very angry for her being late. She then explained
to him how because of the extreme heat of the sun she
fell down on the way. Jamadagni then started with
increased fury his shower of arrows and the Sun in the
disguise of a Brahmin approached and advised him that it
was not possible to strike down the Sun because he was
a swift-mover in the sky and so it was better to withdraw
from that attempt. But Jamadagni said the Sun would
[Page182-a+ 65]
be stationary for some time at midday and then he would
hit the Sun down. When the Sun found that Jamadagni
would never drop his attempt he accepted defeat and
presented Jamadagni with a pair of sandals and an
umbrella to protect against the heat from below and
above. From that day onwards footwear and umbrella
came into vogue.
<div n="NI"/>The practice of presenting sandals and umbrella is
being carried down from generation to generation and
even today it is being followed; these two are given as
gifts on the ‘Śrāddha’ day. (Chapters 95 and 96, Anuśā-
sana Parva, M.B.)
