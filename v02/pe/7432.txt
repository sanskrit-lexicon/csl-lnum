ŚVETAKI¦. A King. He was mostly occupied in perform-
[Page781-a+ 65]
ing Yajñas. Mahābhārata gives the following details
about this yajña lover:
<div n="NI"/>(i) Śvetaki performed numerous Yajñas. He was a
King who was deeply absorbed in Yajñas. (M.B. Ādi
Parva, Chapter 222).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Once the Yajña he performed was so prolonged
that the Ṛtviks were utterly tired and left the Yajña in
the middle. After that the King had to bring in other
Ṛtviks to complete it. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 225,
Verse 21).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) He worshipped Śiva and propitiated him to get a
blessing to enable him to perform many Yajñas. Śiva
advised him that he should do “āhuti” (homa or sacri-
fice) in Agni continuously for twelve years. Accepting
this advice, the king invited Durvāsas to make arrange-
ments for the Yajña. Appointing Durvāsas as Ṛtvik,
Śvetaki continued the Yajña for a hundred years. (For
more information see under Khāṇḍavadāha).
