MADANAMAÑCUKĀ¦. A heroine of ‘Vatsarājacarita’.
Her mother was a nymph in her previous birth. By a
curse of Devendra she was born on earth as Kaliṅgasenā
and lived serving in the palace of Udayana, King of
Vatsa. She desired to make Udayana her husband. In
the meantime a Gandharva named Madanavega fell in
love with Kaliṅgasenā. Knowing that Kaliṅgasenā was
in love with Udayana the Gandharva followed her in
the garb of the King Udayana and at last they were
married. Kaliṅgasenā soon delivered Madanamañ-
cukā, an incarnation of Ratidevi. When she grew up
she married Naravāhanadatta, son of Udayana.
