ANDHAKŪPA¦(M). In the Devī Bhāgavata Mahāviṣṇu
describes 28 hells to Nārada, and Andhakūpam is one
of them. (see Naraka). Andhakūpa is reserved for those
who kill either Brahmins or devotees of God or Sannyā-
sins (holy people). This hell abounds in cruel beasts
like the bear and leopard, evil birds like the eagle,
reptiles like the snake and scorpion and dirty insects
like bugs and mosquitos. The sinner will have to put
up with all these sufferings in hell till the period of his
punishment expires. (Devī Bhāgavata, Aṣṭama
Skandha).
