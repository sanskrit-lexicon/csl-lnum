MEPPATTŪR¦ NĀRĀYAṆA BHAṬṬATIRI. A Sans-
krit poet who lived in Kerala.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information%} It is believed that this poet
lived during the period from 1560 to 1648 A.D. He was
born in the village of Kurumāttūr in Malabar district
The illam (house of nambūtiris) which became famous
by his birth was a mile to the east of the Bhagavatī
temple, Candanakkāvu, which itself is situated just
two furlongs to the north of the well known Tirunāvāya
temple. Meppattūr illam became impoverished and was
merged with another illam of name Maravañceri
Tekkeṭattu.
<div n="NI"/>Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭatiri had a brother named Mātṛdatta.
He was younger to Nārāyaṇa and his work was to take
[Page502-a+ 64]
down the verses which Nārāyaṇa composed. Meppattūr
(Nārāyaṇa is more well-known under the name of his
illam) studied under different preceptors. His father
taught him Mīmāṃsā and such other subjects. He
studied Veda under Mādhavācārya and Tarka under
Dāmodarācārya. Acyuta Piṣāroṭi taught him Vyākaraṇa.
The poet became a rheumatic patient in his old age
and he stayed in the Guruvāyūr temple worshipping
the deity there. His famous work Nārāyaṇīyam was
written sitting in the temple of Guruvāyūr and the
maṇḍapa (raised dais) where he sat and wrote is even
now preserved for pilgrims to see. He took hundred
days to write the Nārāyaṇīyam.
