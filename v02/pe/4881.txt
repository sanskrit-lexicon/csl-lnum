NṚGA¦. A king born in the dynasty of Vaivasvata Manu.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus: Brahmā—
Marīci—Kaśyapa—Vivasvān—Vaivasvata Manu—
Mahābāhu—Prasandhi—Kṣupa—Nṛga.
<div n="NI"/>Nṛga was the younger brother of Ikṣvāku. From Nṛga
was born Sumati, from him the king called Jyotis, from
Jyotis Vasu and from Vasu Pratīka.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Nṛga became chameleon.%} Nṛga was an extremely
righteous and generous King. Once, at Puṣkara he
gifted away thousands of cows to brahmins. There was
a brahmin called Parvata living near Puṣkara. He too
was given a cow and it was after that the brahmin
named Anārata came. By then there remained no cow
to be gifted. Anārata came after Parvata had gone
into the forest after leaving the cow at the pond (Puṣk-
ara). Nṛga had forgotten the fact that the cow had
already been gifted away to Parvata and finding it there
owner-less he gave it to Anārata, who went away with
the cow very much pleased. The King and his minis-
ters also returned to the palace.
<div n="NI"/>A very short time afterwards Parvata returned to the
pond and felt very sorry to miss his cow. He searched
for it here and there and at last found it at Anārata's
house. Quarrel ensued between the two, Parvata
alleging that Anārata had stolen his cow while the
latter contended that it had been given to him by the
King. Now, it was decided that the question should
be submitted for arbitration to the King, and the
contending parties went to the capital to see the King.
At the palace they asked the gate-keepers to tell the
King about their arrival. But, they did not tell the
King, nor did he come.
<div n="NI"/>Angered at this the brahmins cursed that Nṛga be
converted into a chameleon and live as such for a
thousand years. The King heard about the curse and
ran up to the brahmins and requested for absolution
from it. The brahmins then said that after one thou-
sand years Mahāviṣṇu would incarnate as Śrī Kṛṣṇa
and that at his touch Nṛga, the chameleon would
resume his former form as King. According to this
curse Nṛga was born as a chameleon in a neglected
well at Dvārakā. One day Sāmba and others who
happened to go near the well tried their best to take
the chameleon out of it, to no purpose. At last Kṛṣṇa
with his attendants came and took it out of the well.
At Kṛṣṇa's touch it resumed its form as King Nṛga,
and related the story of his curse to the onlookers,
who stood there wondering.
