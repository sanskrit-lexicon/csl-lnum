NAKULA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} The fourth of the Pāṇḍavas. Mādrī, the
second of the two wives of Pāṇḍu meditated on the twin
gods Aśvinīdevas, and recited one of the Mantras given
to Kuntī by the hermit Durvāsas and the two sons
Nakula and Sahadeva were born to her from those
gods. It is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva,
Chapter 67, Stanza 111 that Nakula and Sahadeva
were immensely handsome.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Story of Nakula till the Bhārata battle.%} Naming and
such other rituals after birth were performed for Nakula
also as in the case of the other Pāṇḍava children, by the
hermits who lived in Śataśṛṅga. The ceremony of in-
vestiture with the Brahmā string was conducted by
Kaśyapa the priest of Vasudeva. The royal hermit Śuka
taught Nakula archery and swordsplay, in his
boyhood. When Pāṇḍu died, Mādrī jumped into the
[Page518-b+ 64]
funeral pyre and died leaving her two sons with Kuntī.
After this the hermits of Śataśṛṅga took Kuntī and her
five sons to Bhīṣma at Hastināpura.
<div n="NI"/>At Hastināpura, Nakula learned archery under the great
teacher Droṇa. According to the instruction of the
teacher, Arjuna had to fight with him (teacher) on the
completion of the teaching and during that fight Nakula
and Sahadeva were the guards of Arjuna's chariot-
wheels. As Nakula was such an expert in wielding the
weapons, he got the name ‘Atirathi’. (M.B. Ādi Parva,
Chapter 138, Stanza 30). When the lac-palace was
completed at Vāraṇāvata, the Pāṇḍavas shifted to that
mansion by the instruction of Dhṛtarāṣṭra. When the
lac-palace was set fire to, the Pāṇḍavas escaped by way
of an underground passage and reached the banks of
the Gaṅgā. There Nakula and Sahadeva fell down
weary and exhausted. Bhīma carried them on his
shoulders. After Baka had been killed, they proceeded
to Pāñcālapura, where at the Svayaṃvara (marriage)
Pāñcālī became the wife of the Pāṇḍavas. They returned
to Hastināpura. A son named Śatānīka was born to
Nakula by Pāñcālī. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 95,
Stanza 75).
<div n="NI"/>After that Nakula married Kareṇumatī, the daughter
of the King of Cedi. A son named Niramitra was born
to the couple. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 95, Stanza
70).
<div n="NI"/>Nakula was then sent to the kingdoms of the west for
regional conquest, by Dharmaputra. The wealth of the
kingdoms he had conquered, was carried on ten
thousand camels to the capital Hastināpura. (M.B.
Sabhā Parva, Chapter 32). After the Rājasūya
(imperial consecration) of Yudhiṣṭhira, Nakula went
to Gāndhāra to escort Subala and his sons. After the
defeat of Yudhiṣṭhira in the game of dice, the Pāṇḍa-
vas went to live in the forest. At that time Nakula put
soil all over his body and sat on the ground because of
his profound grief. In the forest, once Jaṭāsura carried
away Nakula. (See under Jaṭāsura). Nakula killed
Kṣemaṅkara, Mahāmaha and Suratha in the forest
At Dvaitavana (a forest) Nakula went to a lake to
fetch water and was killed by Dharmadeva who appear-
ed in the form of a crane. At the request of Dharma-
putra, who came afterwards, all the Pāṇḍavas includ-
ing Nakula were brought to life again, by Dharma.
<div n="NI"/>During the pseudonymity of the Pāṇḍavas at the city of
Virāṭa, Nakula assumed the name Granthika. When
the period of pseudonymity expired, Nakula fought
with the Trigartas on behalf of the King Virāṭa. On
the return of the Pāṇḍavas after the expiry of their
forest-life and pseudonymity, when Duryodhana
announced that he would give not even a single dot of
land to them, Nakula was very eager to decide the
matter by a battle. He proposed that the King Dru-
pada should be made the chief captain of the army.
