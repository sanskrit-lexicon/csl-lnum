BRAHMAPURĪ¦. The abode of Brahmā. Brahmapurī is
on the summit of Mahāmeru, with an area of fourteen
thousand yojanas (leagues). Around this city, at the
four sides, (East etc.) and at the four corners (South-
East etc.) there are eight towns, very big and beautiful,
kept by eight protectors such as Indra and others. The
river Gaṅgā which springs from the feet of Mahāviṣṇu
wets the whole of Candramaṇḍala (Lunar region),
falls down on the Brahmapurī, and dividing itself into
four rivers called Sītā, Alakanandā, Cakṣus and Bhadrā
flows in four directions. The river Sītā flows through
the top of the mountains and passing through the
mountain in the east called Bhadrāśva, falls in the
Eastern Ocean. The river Alakanandā flows to the
south and reaches Bhārata. Then it divides into seven
rivers which unite in the ocean. The river Cakṣus pas-
ses through the mountains in the west and enters the
country called Ketumālavarṣa and then flows into the
ocean. The river Bhadrā passes through all the moun-
tains in the north and flows through the north country
of the Kurūṣa and falls in the North Ocean. The moun-
tain of Mālyavān in the west and the mountain of
Gandhamādana in the east are as long as the moun-
tain of Nīlagiri in the north and the mountain of
Niṣadha in the south. Mount Meru shaped like an ear-
ring stands in the middle of these four mountains.
