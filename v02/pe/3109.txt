KĀLAMĀNA¦. (Calculating time). In ancient days
in India time was calculated in the following
manner.
<div n="NI"/>Time taken (needed) to
pierce a leaf with a
needle—Alpakāla
30 Alpakālas—1 Truṭi
30 Truṭis—1 Kalā
30 Kalās—1 Kāṣṭhā
30 Kāṣṭhās—1 Nimiṣa (mātrā)
4 Nimiṣas—1 Gaṇita
10 Gaṇitas—1 Neṭuvīrpu (time for a
deep sigh)
6 Neṭuvīrpus—1 Vināzhikā
6 Vināzhikās—1 Ghaṭikā
60 Ghaṭikās—1 Day (Ahorātra)
15 Ahorātras—1 Pakṣa (Fortnight)
2 Pakṣas—1 Cāndramāsa (A day for
the Pitṛs)
2 Māsas (months)—1 Ṛtu.
6 Ṛtus—1 year for men (A day for
the Devas)
300 Years (Men's)—1 Divyavarṣa (Divine year)
4800 Divyavarṣas—1 Kṛtayuga
3600 Divyavarṣas—1 Tretāyuga
2400 Divyavarṣas—1 Dvāparayuga
1200 Divyavarṣas—1 Kaliyuga
12000 Divyavarṣas—1 Caturyuga
71 Caturyugas—1 Manvantara
14 Manvantaras—1 Pralaya (Kalpa)
1 Pralaya—Brahmā's one day.
(Bhāgavata Tṛtīya
skandha)
7(1/2) Nāzhikās (Ghaṭikās)—1 Yāma
4 Yāmas—1 day time
8 Yāmas—1 day (day and night).
(Devī Bhāgavata, 9th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>The ‘Kālamāna’ according to the Viṣṇu Purāṇa
differs in certain respects from the calculations given
above. Chapter 3, Part 1 of Viṣṇu Purāṇa says:—
[Page372-b+ 65]
Fifteen Nimiṣas make one Kāṣṭhā. Thirty Kāṣṭhās
make one Kalā and thirty Kalās make one Muhūrta.
Thirty Muhūrtas make one day (man's) and thirty
such days, divided into two fortnights form a Māsa
(month). Six months form an Ayana; there are two
ayanas called Dakṣiṇa and Uttara. Dakṣiṇāyana is
night, and Uttarāyaṇa is day for the Devas. 12,000
Divyavarṣas—Deva varṣas—form a Caturyuga consisting
of the Kṛta—Tretā—Dvāpara and Kali yugas, con-
sisting respectively of 4000, 3000, 2000 and 1000
Divyavarṣas. Before the commencement and after the
end of every one of the above four yugas there is an
interval respectively of 400, 300, 200, and 100 years.
The interval before the commencement is called
Sandhyā and that at the end is called Sandhyāṃśa. The
period between Sandhyā and Sandhhyāṃśa is called Kṛta
yuga etc. One thousand Caturyugas form one day for
Brahmā, and it (Brahmā's one day) has 14 Manus.
<div n="NI"/>Again, Chapter 8, Part 2 of the Viṣṇu Purāṇa has the
following to say about Kālamāna.
<div n="NI"/>Fifteen Nimiṣas make one Kāṣṭhā, thirty Kāṣṭhās one
Kalā, thirty Kalās one muhūrta and thirty muhūrtas
one day and night. Day is long or short according to
the length or shortness of parts of the day, like morning,
noon and evening. Despite the above variation evening
or dusk time is always (2 nāzhikās) the same. The
three muhūrtas from the sun's ardhodaya (when half
of the sun has arisen) is called Prātaḥkāla, (morning)
and it is (1/5)th of day time. The three muhūrtas
following are known as saṃgava. Madhyāhna (noon)
is the three muhūrtas after saṃgava. The time after
madhyāhna is aparāhna (afternoon). Aparāhna lasts
for three muhūrtas. The time after this is dusk. Thus,
a day-time of fifteen muhūrtas is divided into five parts
of three muhūrtas each. On Viṣuvat day the day will
have full fifteen muhūrtas. Then during Uttarāyaṇa
and Dakṣiṇāyana the day will be longer or shorter.
During Uttarāyaṇa the day will be longer than night,
and during Dakṣiṇāyana vice versa. Viṣuvat occurs
when the sun enters the Tulā (Libra) and Meṣa (Aries)
houses. Dakṣiṇāyana is when the sun enters Cancer,
and Uttarāyana when it enters Capricorn.
<div n="NI"/>Fifteen days and nights constitute a Pakṣa (fortnight)
and two Pakṣas one month. Two solar months consti-
tute a Ṛtu (season), three ṛtus one ayana and two
ayanas one year. Since there are four kinds of months,
i.e. Saura, Sāvana, Cāndra and Nākṣatra, years are
considered to be of five different kinds. The first is called
Saṃvatsara; the second parivatsara; the third iḍvatsara;
the fourth, anuvatsara and the fifth, vatsara. This
period of five years is called a yuga. In a yuga of five
years there are 60 saura months, 61 sāvana months,
62 Cāndra months and 67 nākṣatra months. At the
beginning of the sixth year the sun and moon meet in
the same house and that period of five years also is
called yuga. (Śrīdharīyam).
