VIDURA II¦. A Kṣatriya who lived in Pāñcāla. The
story of this Vidura, who had killed a Brahmin because
of his want, is given in Padma Purāṇa, Bhūmikhanḍa,
Chapter 91. The story is given below:
<div n="NI"/>Long ago there lived a Kṣatriya, named Vidura, in
Pāñcāla. Because of penury he killed a Brahmin. After
that the Kṣatriya discarded his lock of hair and Brahma-
[Page850-a+ 64]
string and went to every house saying “Look, here am
I, a slayer of Brahmin. Please, give alms to the drunk-
ard and killer of a Brahmin.” Saying thus he walked
from house to house and took alms. But he did not get
remission of Brahmahatyā (killing of a Brahmin).
<div n="NI"/>Filled with grief and sorrow and mental worry the
sinner Vidura sat in the shade of a tree. At that time
Candraśarmā, a Brahmin of Magadha came there. He
was a wicked man who had killed his teacher because
of inordinate lust in consequence of which he had been
forsaken by his own people. Vidura asked Candraśarmā
who wore no sign of a Brāhmaṇa, what he was. Candra-
śarmā told his story to Vidura who in return told him
his sinful acts.
<div n="NI"/>At this time another Brahmin named Vedaśarmā came
there. He also was a sinner. The three of them told each
other about their sinful acts. At this time Vallāla, a
Vaiśya came there. He was a drunkard who had killed
cows. These four desperate sinners travelled together
and visited several tīrthas (holy baths). But they did not
get remission of their sins. At last they started for
Kālañjaragiri.
<div n="NI"/>While these desperate sinners were living in Kālañjara
a poor Brahmin came there. He asked them why they
were so sad. They told him everything. When he heard
their stories he felt pity for them. The old Brahmin said
“You sinners should go to Prayāga, Puṣkara, Sarvatīrtha
and Vārāṇasī and bathe in the Gaṅgā on New Moon days
and you will become free from sin.” They obeyed the
old Brahmin and went to the holy places told by him.
Thus Vidura and his friends became sinless.
