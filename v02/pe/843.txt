BAHUBHĀRYĀTVA¦. (Polygamy). Polygamy was a
custom in vogue in ancient India. It was not prohibit-
ed for a man to have more than one wife. It was
customary to give dowry also. It is said in the Ṛgveda,
Maṇḍala 10, Anuvāka 3, Sūkta 11 that the bride should
proceed to the house of the husband, after the marriage.
A spell (mantra) meant for keeping down one's co-wife,
is seen in the Ṛgveda, Maṇḍala 10, Anuvāka 11, Sūkta
17. It is a prayer to destroy the love of husband for a
co-wife and to direct that love towards oneself. The
deity of this spell is Indrāṇī the wife of Indra who was
a polygamist. In those days marriage was an essential
duty. Widow marriage was not forbidden.
