ATHARVĀ III¦. In Ṛgveda another Atharvā may be
seen. It is said that he was the author of the Atharva-
veda. After learning Brahmavidyā from Brahmā, it
was this Atharvā who first brought fire to the earth
from heaven. Atharvā had two wives named Śānti and
Citti. This Atharvā was the same person as Atharvaṇa,
the son of Vasiṣṭha. (Bhāgavata, 4th Skandha, Chap-
ter 1).
