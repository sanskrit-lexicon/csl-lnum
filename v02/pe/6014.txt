SĀLVA IV¦. In Uttara Rāmāyaṇa a Sālva, who was a
contemporary of Kuśadhvaja, is mentioned. Kuśadhvaja
once approached this king Sālva and requested for some
financial help. But the covetous Sālva did not give any
help. So Kuśadhvaja performed a sacrifice to obtain
wealth and prosperity. Sītā was born from that sacri-
ficial fire. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
