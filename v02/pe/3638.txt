KRODHA II¦. It is stated in Bhāgavata that Krodha was
born from the eye-brow of Brahmā. There is a story
about this Krodha in the ‘Jaimini-Aśvamedha Parva’.
<div n="NI"/>Once, while the hermit Jamadagni was performing
sacrificial offerings to the Manes, Krodha came there
and secretly put poison in the pudding prepared from
the milk of the sacrificial cow. Even though the hermit
knew this he did not get angry. Seeing this, Krodha
became afraid of the hermit and approaching him said
“Oh, hermit! I thought that the Bhārgavas (those
born of the family of Bhṛgu) would get angry quickly.
Now I understand that it is wrong.” Jamadagni pardon-
ed him and said: “But you have to appease the anger
of the Manes”. The Manes cursed him that he would
have to take birth as a mongoose. But he was given
remission that he would be liberated from the curse,
when he narrated the story of the Brahmin Uñcchavṛtti
at the palace of Dharma in the presence of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
Thus Krodha regained his former form.
