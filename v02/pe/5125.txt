PAURAVA I¦. An ancient Rājarṣi. He became Parvatarāja
when he grew up after being born of the species of the
daitya, Śarabha. Once Arjuna defeated this king. The
Pāṇḍavas invited him for the Mahābhārata battle. But
he did not accept it but joined sides with the Kauravas
against the Pāṇḍavas. Paurava was considered a promi-
nent commander in the Kaurava army. In the Kuru-
kṣetra battle he at first fought against Dhṛṣṭaketu and
then was wounded when he fought against Abhimanyu.
It was Arjuna who killed him in the end. (Chapter 67,
Ādi Parva; Chapter 27, Sabhā Parva; Chapters 4, 128,
Udyoga Parva; Chapter 116, Bhīṣma Parva; Chapter
14, Droṇa Parva; Chapter 5, Karṇa Parva).
