ŚABALĀŚVA I¦. The thousand sons born to Dakṣa of
his wife Vīraṇī, are known as Śabalāśvas. To procre-
ate man-kind Dakṣa first created five hundred sons by
his wife Asiknī and named them Haryaśvas.
Dakṣa had to create the Śabalāśvas as the Haryaśvas
were misled by Nārada. But, Nārada approached and
told the Śabalāśvas also that it was not correct on
their part to procreate children before they had studied
the interior, exterior, bottom and top of the earth.
Believing Nārada's advice the Śabalāśvas also set out
to measure the extent of the earth and they have not
yet returned. Because of this Brahmā cursed that
Nārada, instead of living at one place, should always
be on the move. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part 1, Chapter 15).
