CANDRASENA I¦. A king of Siṃhala deśa (Ceylon).
Candrasena had two daughters, Mandodarī and Indu-
matī by his wife Guṇavatī. Kambugrīva, son of Sudh-
anvā, the chief of Mādra desired to marry Mandodarī.
But, since she preferred unmarried life Kambugrīva's
desire did not fructify. Some time later she refused to
marry another suitor also, King Vīrasena of Kosala.
Meanwhile the marriage of her younger sister, Indumatī
was celebrated, herself having selected Sudeṣṇa, the
Mādra prince at the Svayaṃvara as husband. Though a
handsome person Sudeṣṇa was a philanderer, and one
day Indumatī saw him in bed with her maid-servant.
From that day onwards, cutting asunder all marital
relationship with Sudeṣṇa, Indumatī went and stayed

with her father. This story told by Mahiṣāsura to show
that women possess only very little discretion occurs in
the Pañcama Skandha of Devībhāgavata.
