BHĪMA¦. Bhīmasena, one of the five Pāṇḍavas.
<F>1) Since much information about Bhīma is given under the captions Dharmaputra, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva and Pāñcālī only
a brief description of Bhīma is attempted under the present heading.</F>
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} (See genealogy of Arjuna).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth and childhood.%} King Vicitravīrya of Candra
vaṃśa (lunar dynasty) had two sons called Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra and Pāṇḍu. The Kauravas (Duryodhana etc.) were
sons born to Dhṛtarāṣṭra of his wife Gāndhārī, and the
[Page129-a+ 65]
Pāṇḍavas were the sons of Pāṇḍu and his wives Kuntī
and Mādrī. Dharmaputra, Bhīma and Arjuna were
the sons of Kuntī, and Nakula and Sahadeva of
Mādrī.
<F>1) The Pāṇḍavas were not in fact direct issues of Pāṇḍu. For details see Kuntī.</F>
<div n="NI"/>Kuntī directed a mantra gifted to her by Durvāsas to-
wards Vāyubhagavān (the wind-god) and the result
was the birth of Bhīma. Hence he is called Vāyu-putra
(son of the wind-god). At the time of his birth a celestial
voice announced that the boy would grow up to be the
strongest among the strong. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 122,
Verse 14). On the tenth day after birth the child Bhīma
fell from his mother's lap on a rock. Bhīma was not
injured in any manner by that fall, although it crushed
the rock into power. (This story is told in the southern
texts of the Mahābhārata in Chapter 132 of Ādi Parva).
The naming ceremony of the child was performed by
the Maharṣis, who stayed at Śataśṛṅga. Kaśyapa Maha-
rṣi, family priest of Vasudeva performed the ceremonies
like wearing of the sacred thread. Bhīma learned fight-
ing with the gadā (club or mace) from Śuka, the famous
Rājarṣi.
<div n="NI"/>The Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas spent their childhood
in Hastināpura. Droṇācārya taught them fighting
with weapons. The Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas often
engaged themselves in children's games. In all such
games Bhīma used to hurt and defeat the Kauravas,
and to this fact the unending hatred of the Kauravas
towards Bhīma owed its origin. Once they adminis-
tered poison to Bhīma who fell down unconscious, and
then they threw him into the depths of the Gaṅgā
(Ganges). Going deeper and deeper in the waters
Bhīma, at last, reached the Nāgaloka, where the nāgas
(serpents) bit him which neutralized the effects of the
poison in his body. There he got acquainted with a
nāga called Āryaka, who introduced him to Vāsuki,
king of the nāgas, and Vāsuki presented him with much
wealth and other costly gems. But, what use was all
this wealth to Bhīma? Then Vāsuki agreed to give him
a divine drink, which would give the user of it the
strength of thousand elephants. Bhīma drank at one
draught eight pot-fulls of that divine drink, and thus
became tremendously strong. But, he had to wait in
Nāgaloka for eight days so that the drink might be
thoroughly assimilated, and on the ninth day the nāgas
saw him off in all pomp and splendour. Bhīma returned
to his mother and brothers and consoled them, who
were terribly anxious at his absence.
<div n="NI"/>When the training of the princes in the use of weapons
was over a competition or test was conducted. Duryo-
dhana and Bhīma entered into a ‘club-fight’, and when
Karṇa tried to intervene in the fight his nobility was
questioned by Bhīma. Duryodhana then insulted Bhīma.
Arjuna agreed to present King Drupada before Droṇā-
cārya as gurudakṣinā to him. In the fierce war the
Pāṇḍavas fought with Drupada, Bhīma annihilated the
elephant division of the latter's army. And, afterwards
Bhīma underwent higher training in club-war at the
hands of Balabhadrarāma. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 136,
Verse 4).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The Pāṇḍavas left Hastināpura.%} As enmity between
the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas began growing stronger
and stronger, Duryodhana, with his father's permission,
removed the Pāṇḍavas to vāraṇāvata and settled them
there. They were put up there in a palace specially
[Page129-b+ 64]
made of lac. The Pāṇḍavas divined the secret of it and
escaped from the fire, when the palace was set fire to.
Verse 10, Chapter 147 of the Ādi Parva states that it
was Bhīma, who set fire to the palace. Escaping thus
through a tunnel the Pāṇḍavas travelled a great distance
in the forest. Kuntī and four of her sons got tired by the
exertions of the travel and were forced to sit down for
rest on the way. Bhīma, continued the journey carrying
the mother and his four brothers on his shoulders. With
their entry into Hiḍiṃba forest the weakness left them,
and they became their former selves.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Hiḍiṃba killed.%} Kuntī devī and four sons slept under
the shade of a tree at dusk, and Bhīma kept guard over
them. There dwelt in the forest a Rākṣasa called Hiḍiṃba
with his sister, Hiḍiṃbī. Hiḍiṃba looked around that
particular day from the top of a tree, and detecting
Bhīma his mouth watered. He deputed Hiḍimbī to
bring Bhīma over to him. Hiḍiṃbī approached Bhīma,
whose fine figure kindled feelings of love in her. She
desired to have him as husband. Hiḍiṃbī having not
returned even after a long time Hidiṃba went over to
the spot, and there finding Hiḍiṃbī in love-talks with
Bhīma he got terribly angry. He wanted to kill Hiḍiṃbī.
Bhīma, who could not suffer the killing of a woman in
his presence rushed against Hiḍiṃba, The noise of the
fight awakened the other Pāṇḍavas from sleep, and at
the instance of Arjuna, Bhīma killed Hiḍiṃba. Thus
rendered helpless and forlorn Hiḍiṃbī again craved
Bhīma for love. On the suggestion of Kuntī, whose
heart melted at the sight of Hiḍiṃbī's helplessness Bhīma
took her as his wife. But, one condition was stipulated
for their enjoying the honey-moon. The condition was
that they might enjoy honey-moon, from dawn to dusk
in the sky and on mountain tops, Hiḍiṃbī, who was
endowed with magic powers carrying Bhīma with her.
And, after dusk Bhīma was to be returned to Kuntī.
Accordingly Bhīma and Hiḍiṃbī spent one year, and
to them was born a son called Ghaṭotkaca. Promising
that he shall return when wanted, Ghaṭotkaca with his
mother went into the forest. The Pāṇḍavas also left
for the village called Ekacakrā. (Ādi Parva, Chapters
147-154).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Killing of Baka and the wedding of Pāñcālī.%} While at
Ekacakrā Bhīma killed the Rākṣasa called Baka and
freed the people of the village from their distress.
Afterwards the Pāṇḍavas attended the Svayamvara
(free choice of the husband by woman) of Pāñcālī,
who became their wife. There Bhīma defeated Śalya
in fight. And, the Pāṇḍavas duly returned to Hastinā-
pura. (For details see Baka, Pāñcālī and Arjuna).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Again to forest.%} On their return to Hastinapura the
Pāṇḍavas took their residence in the palace built by
Maya. There Maya presented a magnificent club to
Bhīma. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 3, Verse 18). It was
Śrī Kṛṣṇa, lord of Dvārakā who served as the right hand
of the Pāṇḍavas. Jarāsandha, who was then King of
Magadha fought with Kṛṣṇa eighteen times and got
defeated. Yet he did not yield, and at last Kṛṣṇa decided
to do away with him. Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna and Bhīma, in
disguise, set out for Magadha. They entered Jarāsandha's
palace and challenged him to a duel. Bhīma and Jarā-
sandha clashed, and at the instance of Kṛṣṇa Bhīma
rent the latter in two and threw him on the ground.
Though Jarāsandha was alive again, Bhīma rent him
[Page130-a+ 61]
in two and threw away the two parts to two places.
(M.B. Sabhā Parva, Southern Text, Chapter 24).
<div n="NI"/>The main impediments and thorns in their way thus
having been removed, Dharmaputra decided to perform
Rājasūya. Bhīma was deputed to conquer all the king-
doms in the eastern part of India. Bhīma achieved the
object and returned with great wealth to Indraprastha.
Though Bhīma got ready to kill Śiśupāla, who alone
refused to acknowledge the suzerainty of Yudhiṣṭhira,
he also yielded on the tactful advice of Bhīṣma. The
Rājasūya Yajña went off quite successfully. It was
Bhīma, who, after the Yajña was over, took Bhīṣma and
Yudhiṣṭhira to Hastināpura. Afterwards, in the contest
in the game of dice played between Dharmaputra and
Duryodhana, the Pāṇḍavas lost everything. The Kaura-
vas brought Pāñcālī into the assembly hall and attempted
to strip her naked in public. Bhīma who got enraged at
this shouted that the hands of Yudhiṣṭhira who played
dice should be burnt in fire. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 68,
Verse 6). And, Bhīma took then and there the terrible
pledge that he would, with his hands stained by blood
from the chest of Duśśāsana, who tried to rip Pāñcālī
naked, tie up Pāñcālī's hair which got untied in the
scuffle. He also swore that he would break the thigh of
Duryodhana. In uncontrollable rage Bhīma also shouted
that he would turn into ashes all those who took part in
the game of dice. Bhīma took also the vow that all the
Kauravas would be killed.
<div n="NI"/>According to the terms and conditions laid down with
regard to the contest in the game of dice the Pāṇḍavas
went into the Kāmyaka forest to live there for twelve
years and then to live incognito for one year.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Life in forest and life incognito.%} There lived in Kām-
yaka forest a Rākṣasa called Kirmīra, brother of Bala,
whom Bhīma had killed on an earlier occasion. Kirmīra,
who was awaiting an opportunity to avenge the murder
of his brother, now clashed with Bhīma in the forest.
Bhīma did very easily kill him. (For details see Kir-
mīra).
<div n="NI"/>Thus the Pāṇḍavas spent their days once again in the
Kāmyaka forest under the spiritual leadership of sage
Dhaumya. They thought about their lost kingdom.
Should they go to war against the Kauravas or should
they spend the rest of their lives in the exercise of dhārmic
injunctions? At one time Bhīma advised Yudhiṣṭhira
against war; but on another occasion he pleaded vehe-
mently in favour of war. It was during this time that
Arjuna went to the Himālayas to please Śiva by penance
and get from him the Pāśupatāstra. (Arrow called
Pāśupata). The Pāṇḍavas naturally got nervous and
upset at the rather long absence of Arjuna; Bhīma was
more anxious and sorry than the others. Then the
Pāṇḍavas set out in search of Arjuna, and travelled upto
Mount Gandhamādana. Then the party got so tired
that they could not proceed any further. Pāñcālī fell
down fainting. Then Bhīma remembered Ghaṭotkaca,
who appeared before his father (Bhīma) at once. As
directed by Bhīma Ghaṭotkaca mounted the Pāṇdavas
on his shoulders and the journey continued. They
reached the Āśrama of Naranārāyaṇas, and rested there
for six days. One day the wind blowing from the north-
[Page130-b+ 65]
east dropped near Pāñcālī a Saugandhika flower. And,
Bhīma set out in the north-east direction to fetch saugan-
dhika flowers for Pāñcālī, who felt a special liking for
them.
<div n="NI"/>Walking and walking Bhīma entered Kadalīvana.
Hanūmān, his skin wrinkled and hair grey due to old
age, was living in this forest. He obstructed the path of
Bhīma. Hanūmān awoke from sleep and raised his tail
with a terrific sound. Bhīma walked upto the place
whence the sound was heard.
<F>1. When raised, Hanūmān's tail was as high in the sky as the flag of Indra, and produced a thunderous sound. As though the
mountains were vomitting through their mouth, the sound produced by the raising of the tail shook the mountains. Drowning the trumpeting of
excited elephants the sound reverberated all around the mountains. Hearing the sound Bhīma, his whole body horripilated entered the
forest in the direction of the sound. In the middle of Kadalīvana, on a mighty rock, Bhīma saw Hanūmān.</F> (Vanaparva, Chapter
146). In the clash that ensued between Hanūmān and
Bhīma the former came out victorious. Hanūmān,
however, congratulated Bhīma and directed him on the
path to the saugandhika forest.
<div n="NI"/>Bhīmasena reached the saugandhika forest, which was
being guarded by the Rākṣasas called Krodhavaśas.
Bhīma overcame them, collected the flowers and return-
ing with them stayed in the Badarikāśrama with his
brothers and Pāñcālī. Here it was that Bhīma killed
Jaṭāsura. (For details see Jaṭāsura II).
<div n="NI"/>Four years were thus spent; yet Arjuna had not returned.
The Pāṇḍavas continued their journey northward.
On the 17th day they came to the Āśrama of Vṛṣaparvā
in the Himālayas. They were duly received by the
maharṣi, who directed them in their onward journey.
Continuing the journey they reached the Āśrama of
Ārṣṭiṣeṇa whence, after crossing various mountain peaks
and still walking they reached Kubera's Alakāpurī when
a Yakṣa called Maṇimān obstructed their further pro-
gress. Bhīma killed Maṇimān and the other Yakṣas who
rushed to his support. Finally Kubera himself saw
Bhīma and blessed the Pāṇḍavas.
<div n="NI"/>While they were returning from Kubera's palace Bhīma
was caught by a python. But, it was really Nahuṣa
transformed into a python on account of a curse. Bhīma
killed it and it assumed its original form as Nahuṣa.
(See Agastya, Para 8). By this time Arjuna had obtained
Pāśupatāstra from Śiva and he duly returned to his
brothers, and the Pāṇḍavas continued their journey in
the forest.
<div n="NI"/>Meantime, knowing that the Pāṇḍavas were put up in
Dvaitavana, the Kauravas started for their dwelling
place in a procession led by Duryodhana with the army
and camped nearly two furlongs away from a pool in
Dvaitavana. While thus camping Duryodhana clashed
with a Gandharva called Citrasena, who with a number
of his comrades came to the pool for water games,
and in the encounter the latter made Duryodhana
prisoner. Bhīmasena who witnessed the scene very much
laughed at Duryodhana. But, Arjuna intervened and
set free Duryodhana and others.
<div n="NI"/>The Pāṇḍavas again entered the Kāmyaka forest, and
it was at that time that Jayadratha abducted Pāñcālī.
Bhīma killed Koṭikāsya who acted on behalf of Jaya-
dratha. (See Koṭikāsya). Moreover Bhīma captured
Jayadratha, got his head shaved clean and declared that
he was a slave of Dharmaputra. It was here at Dvaita-
vana that Dharmadeva tested the Pāṇḍavas, who had
gone to a nearby pool to fetch water; all the Pāṇḍavas
except Yudhiṣṭhira died at the pool, but were brought
back to life again. (See Dharmaputra, Para 7). The
[Page131-a+ 64]
twelve years’ forest-life of the Pāṇḍavas now came to
an end.
<div n="NI"/>According to the advice of Dharmadeva the Pāṇḍavas
selected the Virāṭa palace for their life incognito, Bhīma-
sena assuming the name Vallava (Valala). And, here
Bhīma killed in a duel Jīmūta, the pugilist. (See Jīmūta
II). It was also here that Bhīma killed Kīcaka and the
Upakīcakas. (See Kīcaka). On another occasion, at
the instance of Yudhiṣṭhira Bhīma took Sudharmā, King
of Daśārṇa to Yudhiṣṭhira captive; but he was later set
free. Next year the Pāṇḍavas defeated Duryodhana in
the fight in connection with the theft of the cows of the
Virāṭa King, and then they declared that their forest
life and life incognito were over.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Bhīma in the great war.%} Even after the return of the
Pāṇḍavas after the forest life and life incognito the
Kauravas refused to give them half of the kingdom. So,
both the parties began preparations for war. Given here-
under is the main incident relating to Bhīma from this
period to the Svargārohaṇa (going to Heaven) of the
Pāṇḍavas after relinquishing the kingdom in favour of
Parīkṣit, including their victory in war and the adminis-
tration of the country.

<div n="NI"/>8) {%Bhīma's conceit put down.%} While, after the great war,
the Pāṇḍavas and Śrī Kṛṣṇa were discussing several
matters all the Pāṇḍavas except Bhīma said they owed
their success in war to Kṛṣṇa. But, Bhīma, in all haughti-
ness claimed the credit for victory to his personal prowess.
With the object of putting down this conceit on the part
of Bhīma, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, with Bhīma seated along with him
on Garuḍa, set out on a journey to the south. After
crossing the sea and Mount Subela Śrī Kṛṣṇa, pointing
out to Bhīma a lake twelve yojanas wide and lying
near Laṅkā, asked him to find out the source of the lake
and return with the information. Though Bhīma walked
some distance he could not find out its source. Not only
that, all the warriors there jointly attacked Bhīma, and
finding himself impotent to counter the attack he ran
back to Śrī Kṛṣṇa for refuge. Then Śrī Kṛṣṇa with his
ring clipped and threw away the lake, and said to Bhīma
as follows:—“This is the skull of Kumbhakarṇa killed
by Śrī Rāma in the Rāma-Rāvaṇa war. The warriors
who attacked you are the asuras called ‘Sarogeyas’.”
These words of the lord put down Bhīma's conceit,
and he apologised to Kṛṣṇa. (Skanda Purāṇa, 1.2.66).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Death.%} After entrusting matters of administration of
the country to Parīkṣit the Pāṇḍavas set out on their
great journey. Yudhiṣṭhira walking in the front, they
started for Kailāsa. During the course of their journey
Pāñcālī, Sahadeva, Nakula and Arjuna one after the
other fell down dead. Bhīma asked Yudhiṣṭhira the
reason for the deaths and he was given suitable answers
by the latter. At last when Bhīma too was about to fall
down and die he asked the reason thereof, and Yudhiṣ-
ṭhira replied that Bhīma's over-eating was the reason.
Afterwards when Dharmaputra entered Heaven he
found his brothers had already their seats there. (See
Arjuna, Para 31).
