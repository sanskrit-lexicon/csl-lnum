GĀNDHĀRA¦. A stretch of land of ancient Bhārata. It
is believed that this land stretched from the shores of
river Sindhu to Kābul. Subala was a mighty ruler of
this country. His daughter Gāndhārī was the wife of
Dhṛtarāṣṭra. (Śloka 11, Chapter 111, Ādi Parva).

Gāndhāras and the Drāviḍas. Descending in order from
