KUBERATĪRTHA¦. A holy place on the banks of the
river Sarasvatī. Once the Devas appeared to Kubera at
this tīrtha and granted him overlordship of wealth,
friendship of Śiva, Deva-hood and rulership of the
world. The Marudgaṇas crowned him King. He got
the son Nalakūbara also there. The place, thus
important in many ways came to be reputed as Kubera-
tīrtha in later years. (Śalya Parva, Chapter 97).
