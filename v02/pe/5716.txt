RĀVAṆA¦. The Rākṣasa King of Laṅkā who had ten
heads.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus:—Brahmā—
Pulastya—Viśravas—Rāvaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Viśravas, grandson of Brahmā and son of
Pulastya married Kaikasī, daughter of Sumālī. While
Viśravas and Kaikasī were living in the forest Śleṣmā-
taka, Kaikasī became pregnant. She delivered four
children in four Yāmas, with an interval of one yāma
between them. The elder three were the famous
Rākṣasas, Rāvaṇa, Kumbhakarṇa and Vibhīṣaṇa; the
fourth one, a girl, was named Śūrpaṇakhā. (Kamba
Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>Kubera was another son of Viśravas born of another
wife called Devavarṇī alias Īlabilā. As soon as he
came of age Kubera captured the Puṣpaka chariot and
began ruling the kingdom with Laṅkā as capital.
(Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Previous lives of Rāvaṇa.%} See under Jaya XI.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Rāvaṇa secured boons.%} Kaikasī (Rāvaṇa's mother)
who became envious of the pomp and prowess of Kubera
advised her son to secure boons from Brahmā by tapas
and become equal to Kubera. Accordingly he went to
Gokarṇa with his brothers and began tapas. Kumbha-
karṇa did tapas for 10,000 years; Vibhīṣaṇa also did
tapas for 10,000 years standing on one foot. Rāvaṇa,
standing in the middle of the five fires, meditated upon
Brahmā. Though 10,000 years passed thus, Brahmā did
not appear yet. Rāvaṇa then cut one of his ten heads
and made an offering of it to Brahmā in the fire. Thus,
within 9000 years he cut nine of his heads and offered
them to Brahmā in the fire. Lastly when he was about
to cut off his tenth head, Brahmā appeared and asked
him to choose whatever boon he wanted. Rāvaṇa
chose the boon that from none but men should he
meet with his death. Kumbhakarṇa desired to secure
the boon of ‘nirdevatva’ (Absence of the devas) but
secured by a slip of the tongue ‘nidrāvatvam’ (sleep).
Vibhīṣaṇa chose devotion to Viṣṇu. On his return
after securing the boons, Rāvaṇa occupied Laṅkā,
drove away Kubera and took his puṣpaka chariot.
Rāvaṇa further declared Mahāviṣṇu to be his eternal
enemy. Hearing about Rāvaṇa's victory the Rākṣasas
from Pātāla came to live in Laṅkā.

<div n="NI"/>5) {%Family life.%} Rāvana married Mandodarī, foster-
daughter of Mayāsura and three sons, Meghanāda,
Atikāya and Akṣakumāra were born to the couple. He
then conquered the whole world with the cooperation
of his sons and other Rākṣasas. The Aṣṭadikpālakas
(protectors of the eight regions) were subjugated. He
attacked Devaloka, but was defeated and imprisoned.
Meghanāda by magical trickery captured Indra and
released Rāvaṇa from custody. Meghanāda came to be
called Indrajit from that day onwards.

ārjuna, Para 6.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Curses heaped on Rāvaṇa.%} As a result of ruling the
land, as a terror to the whole world, for many years
and of his triumphal journey Rāvaṇa had invited on
his head eighteen śāpas (curses) as follows.
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Nalakūbara śāpa.%} Rāvaṇa once insulted Rambhā,

of sage Kuśadhvaja, was doing tapas to secure Śrī
Mādhava as her husband. Rāvaṇa committed rape on

will be ruined by Lord Nārāyaṇa on account of me.”
<div n="NI"/>(iii) {%Brāhmaṇaśāpa.%} He invited a Vedic brahmin to
install the idol of Tripurasundarī given to him by

<div n="NI"/>(xiii) {%Maudgalyaśāpa.%} Once maharṣi Maudgalya was
sitting in the svastika pose resting his neck on the
yogadaṇḍa (a short stick-like piece of wood with a
handle) Rāvaṇa happened to come there and he cut
into two the yogadaṇḍa with his Candrahāsa (sword)
with the result that the maharṣi fell down with face
upwards and broke his back-bone. The maharṣi then
cursed that Rāvaṇa's Candrahāsa would prove in-
effective in future.
<div n="NI"/>(xiv) {%Brāhmaṇajananīśāpa.%} Certain young brahmin

<div n="NI"/>9) {%He threatened Devas.%} Rāvaṇa, during his triumphal
march with the armies, once came to the Uśīravīra
mountain. Then the King called Marutta was per-
forming Maheśvara yajña on the plains of the moun-
tain. Indra and the other devas came to receive their
portion of the offerings. But they ran away in fear on
the arrival of Rāvaṇa. Indra assumed the form of a
peacock, Yama that of a crow, Kubera that of a
chameleon and Varuṇa that of a swan, and the devas,
thus assuming various forms went away in different
directions. Marutta got angry and got ready to fight
Rāvaṇa. But, as the maharṣis prevented him from it no
fighting took place. Rāvaṇa returned with the
glories of victory.
<div n="NI"/>10) {%He defeated Kāla.%} Once Nārada felt the urge to
witness a quarrel. He went to Laṅkā and told Rāvaṇa
tales about Kāla, that Kāla was more powerful than
Rāvaṇa, that Kāla would soon be causing Rāvaṇa's
death etc. These stories awakened the anger in Rāvaṇa
against Kāla, and the former, with a strong army
challenged Kāla, and war between the two started.
[Page647-a+ 65]
Brahmā was in a fix, for he had given Rāvaṇa
the boon that the latter would be killed only by a man.
At the same time he had given the boon to Kāla that
anybody thrashed with his (Kāla's) club would die.
Brahmā, therefore, decided to end the fighting between
Kāla and Rāvaṇa somehow, and he approached Kāla
and requested him to withdraw from fighting. Accord-
ingly Kāla acknowledged defeat and thus the fighting
ended.
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Rāvaṇa attacked Pātāla.%} Afterwards Rāvaṇa march-
ed with his army to Pātāla where he defeated Takṣaka,
the nāga King and exacted tributes from him. Then
he attacked Nivātakavacas. When the fighting became
very fierce Brahmā intervened and brought about a
compromise between the two. Next, Rāvaṇa attacked
Surabhi in Varuṇa's palace, but the Rākṣasas who
emerged from the pores on Surabhi's body drove away
Rāvaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Raped Rambhā.%} See under Nalakūbara.
<div n="NI"/>13) {%His death.%} Rāvaṇa's sister, Śūrpaṇakhā met Śrī
Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa at Pañcavaṭī and wanted first
Rāma and then Lakṣmaṇa to marry her. But,
Lakṣmaṇa cut away her nose, breasts etc. Enraged by
this Rāvaṇa abducted Sītā. Śrī Rāma, with the help of
the monkey-army, killed Rāvaṇa in war. (See under
Rāma.
