MĀNUṢATĪRTHA¦. A sacred pond lying on the
outskirts of Kurukṣetra. There is a legend showing
the origin of this pond. Once a hunter wounded a
deer with his arrow and the deer ran and dropped
itself into the pond. When it rose up from the water
it became a man. From that day onwards the pond
became holy and got the name Mānuṣatīrtha. (Śloka
65, Chapter 86, Vana Parva).
