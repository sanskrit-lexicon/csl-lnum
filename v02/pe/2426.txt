GHOṢĀ¦. A tapasvinī famed in Ṛgveda. She was the
grand-daughter of Dṛgata maharṣi and daughter of sage
Kakṣīvān. As she contracted leprosy in her very child-
hood nobody came forward to marry her. Ultimately
she composed a mantra in praise of Aśvinīdevas. They
cured Ghoṣā of leprosy and she got married. (Ṛgveda,
Maṇḍala 1, Anuvāka 7, Sūkta 117).
