KUŚA II¦. One of the two sons of Śrī Rāma, the other,
being Lava.
<div n="NI"/>1). {%Birth.%} To Sītā forsaken by Rāma a son called Lava
was born while she was living at the āśrama of Vālmīki.
One day Sītā took Lava to the stream to bathe him,
and Vālmīki, who did not know about it was upset not
to see the child in the āśrama. He feared that it might
have been eaten up by some animal, and fearing that
Sītā might die when she missed the child he created a
child with Kuśa grass and laid it where Lava was lying
before. When Sītā returned to the āśrama with Lava
after their bath Vālmīki explained the whole situation
to Sītā. Since the second child was created with Kuśa
grass he was called Kuśa, and he was made the second
son of Sītā (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa and Kathāsaritsāgara,
Alaṅkāravatīlambaka, Taraṅga 1).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Kuśa went to Ayodhyā.%} Śrī Rāma decided to conduct
an Aśvamedha yajña. It was ordained that the emperor,
who conducted a yajña should have his wife. As Sītā
had been abandoned, Rāma had no wife for the pur-
poses of the yajña. It was laid down that in the absence
of the wife a statue of hers may be made with palāśa
wood. But, Vasiṣṭha decreed that a statue of Sītā
might be made with gold. The yajña was to be held
in the Naimiṣa forest. During the triumphal tour of
Śatrughna with the yājñika horse he reached the banks
of the river Tamasā near the āśrama of Vālmīki where
[Page446-a+ 65]
Lava and Kuśa captured the horse. Śatrughna could
not defeat Lava and Kuśa, and they routed the addi-
tional force also which arrived under the leadership of
Lakṣmaṇa to help Śatrughna. Then Vālmīki intervened
and the horse was returned to Śatrughna. Afterwards,
Vālmīki, Sītā and Lavakuśas also attended Śrī Rāma's
yajña where Lava and Kuśa recited the poem Rāmā-
yaṇa composed by Vālmīki. Rāma recognised the boys
and they were made to live in Ayodhyā. Thus did
Kuśa visit Ayodhyā.
<div n="NI"/>The Kathāsaritsāgara tells the following story about
Kuśa's visit to Ayodhyā.
<div n="NI"/>Vālmīki duly performed the thread-wearing ceremony
of Lava and Kuśa and taught them, even in their very
childhood, all arts and sciences including the secrets
about divine arrows. The boys one day killed a deer in
the āśrama and worshipped with its flesh the liṅga, which
Vālmīki used to worship daily, and as a result of that
the sage became ill. Sītādevī requested for penance for
the action of her children, and Vālmīki said that Lava
should bring golden lotus flowers from Vaiśravaṇa's
pond and flowers of Kalpakavṛkṣa from his garden, and
that Lava and Kuśa together should worship the
Śivaliṅga with those flowers. Lava then went to mount
Kailāsa and after killing many yakṣas collected the
flowers. On his way back he rested for some time at the
foot of a tree. Just then Lakṣmaṇa, who was on the
look-out for a human being for the naramedha (human
sacrifice) of Śrī Rāma, also reached the spot. He
decided to take Lava captive with him, and they fought
with each other for some time. At last Lakṃaṇa
took Lava captive by using mohanāstra (arrow which
makes the opponent unconscious) and took him to
Ayodhyā. Sītā was pained that Lava had not returned
yet, and Vālmīki with his divine vision understood the
reason for his absence. He deputed Kuśa to Ayodhyā
to bring back with him Lava somehow or other. When
Kuśa reached Ayodhyā, Śrī Rāma was conducting the
Aśvamedha yajña, and Kuśa, successfully confronting a
number of people, got into the yajña ground. In the
combat that ensued between Kuśa and Lakṣmaṇa the
latter was defeated, as he could not defeat Kuśa due to
the greatness of Vālmīki. When Śrī Rāma asked
Kuśa who he was he replied that he was the brother
of Lava and that he had heard from his mother Sītā
that both of them were the sons of Śrī Rāma. Rāma
was overjoyed to hear that and he covered the boys
with kisses. Sītā also was brought down from the āśrama
of Vālmīki, and all of them lived very happily. (Kathā-
saritsāgara, Alaṃkāravatīlambaka, Taraṅga 1).
<div n="NI"/>3). {%Kuśa's reign.%} Following the demise of Lakṣmaṇa Śrī
Rāma divided the country between Kuśa and Lava. A
city called Kuśāvatī was built in the Kosala Kingdom
and Kuśa was crowned King thereof. Thirtytwo out
of the sixtyfour akṣauhiṇīs of the kings of the solar
dynasty, four out of the eight ministers and half of the
movable property were allotted to Kuśa. Lava was
crowned king of north Kosala where a city called
Śarāvatī was built for him, and the other half of the
army, ministers etc. became his share. While Kuśa and
Lava were ruling the country thus, Śrī Rāma immolated
himself in the depths of the river Sarayū (Uttara
Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>4). {%Kuśa's successors.%} Descended from Śrī Rāma thus:
Kuśa—Aditi—Niṣadha—Nabhas—Puṇḍarīka—Kṣema-
[Page446-b+ 65]
dhanvā—Devānīka—Ṛkṣa—Pāriyātra—Vindorala—
Vajranābha—Khagaṇa—Vīdhṛti—Hiraṇyanābha—
Puṣya—Dhruva—Sudarśana—Agnipūrṇa—Śīghra—
Maru. The solar dynasty was annihilated at the advent
of Kaliyuga (Bhāgavata, 9th Skandha).
