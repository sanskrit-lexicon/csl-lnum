PIṄGALA I¦. A deva who is an attendant of the Sun-
god. Sūrya (Sun-god) rides in a one-wheeled
chariot drawn by seven horses and he bears in his
hands two lotuses. On his right side stands the attend-
ant Daṇḍī with an ink-pot and a writing stick and
on his left side stands the attendant Piṅgala with a
stick. Both these are demi god attendants of Sūrya.
