MAṄKAṆA¦ (MAṄKANA). A barber of Vārāṇasī
who was a great devotee of Gaṇeśa. During the time of
King Divodāsa II Śiva wanted to destroy the city of
Kāśī and deputed his son Gaṇeśa (Nikumbha) for the
same.
<div n="NI"/>Gaṇeśa came to Kāśī and appearing in person before
his devotee Maṅkaṇa, asked him to build a temple on
the outskirts of Kāśī. Maṅkaṇa completed the temple
and Gaṇeśa (Nikumbha) installed himself in that
temple getting for it the name Nikumbhamandira.
Devotees began to flow into the temple and Nikumbha
sitting there answered the prayers of all. But he never
fulfilled the prayer of the King to have a son. This
annoyed Divodāsa and he destroyed the temple and
then Nikumbha cursed that the city of Kāśī would
become desolate. Śiva's desire thus became fulfilled.
(92. 33, Vāyu Purāṇa and 3; 67, 43, Brahmāṇḍa
Purāṇa).
