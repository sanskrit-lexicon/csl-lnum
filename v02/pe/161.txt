ALAKANANDĀ¦. River Gaṅgā of devaloka. The river
gaṅgā of the earth when it flows through devaloka is
called Alakanandā and is called Vaitaraṇī when it flows
through Pitṛloka (nether world). Kṛṣṇadvaipāyana
(Vyāsa) declares that Deva Gaṅgā with crystal pure
water flowing in devaloka under the name Alakanandā
and Vaitaraṇī of the nether world, a terror to sinners,
are the same as the Gaṅgā of the earth. (Ślokas 21 and
22, Chapter 170, Bhāṣā Bhārata, A.P.).
<div n="NI"/>Starting from Viṣṇupāda Alakanandā flows through
Devayāna which blazes with the splendour of a crore of
beautiful many-storeyed buildings. Flowing from there
to Candramaṇḍala (moon) and flooding it completely
flows down to Brahmaloka. From there it divides into
four rivulets and flows to the four different sides with
the names Sītā, Cakṣus, Alakanandā and Bhadrā. Of
these Sītā falls on the thickly wooded mountain tops of
Mahāmeru and flowing from there through Gandha-
mādana by the side of Bhadrāśvavarṣa falls down in the
eastern ocean. Cakṣus falls on the top of Mālyavān
mountain and flowing through Ketumāla falls down in
the western ocean. The most sacred of the group,
Alakanandā, falls on the mountain of Hemakūṭa and
from there flows through Bhāratavarṣa and falls down
in the southern ocean. The fourth, Bhadrā, falling on
the top of the Mountain, Sṛṅgavān flows to the northern
ocean. Of these the most sacred is Alakanandā which
flows through Bhāratavarṣa and it is believed that even
those who think of taking a bath in that will acquire the
benefit of performing yāgas like Aśvamedha and Rāja-
sūya. (Eighth Skandha of Śrī Mahādevībhāgavata).
