EKAVĪRA¦
<F>1. The genealogy of Ekavīra is stated differently in different Purāṇas. Devī Bhāgavata states that Ekavīra is the son of Turvasu,
son of Yayāti and that he is the father of Kārtavīryārjuna. It is not correct. The genealogy chronicled here is based on Agni and Viṣṇu
Purāṇas. According to that Yadu, son of Yayāti is the father of the grandfather of Ekavīra: Yadu—Sahasrajit—Satajit—Hehaya (Ekavīra).
Descending from Ekavīra—Dharma—Kuṇi—Bhadrasena—Dhanaka—Krtavīra—Kārtavīrvārjuna. From the grandson of Kārtavīryārjuna,
Vṛṣṇi, starts the Vṛṣṇi dynasty.</F> (HEHAYA). A founder of the Hehaya
line of kings.

<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth of Ekavīra.%} Once there was a King called
Revanta who was an intimate friend of Indra. One day
riding on Uccaiḥśravas, Indra's horse, he went to
Vaikuṇṭha. Fascinated by the arresting beauty of
Revanta, Mahālakṣmī sat gaping for a while and did
not hear what Viṣṇu talked to her. Viṣṇu was offended
and lost his temper. Lakṣmī was looking with interest
alternatively at Revanta and the horse when Viṣṇu
cursed her to be born as a mare on earth. Horrified,
shedding tears, Lakṣmī begged for relief. Viṣṇu decreed
that she would return to Vaikuṇṭha after giving birth
to a son who would be equal in glory to Viṣṇu himself.
Mahālakṣmī came to Earth taking the shape of a mare
and lived in a forest situated at a point where the rivers
Kālindī and Tamasā meet and where once Sūryapatnī
stayed and did penance. Meditating on Śiva she lived
there for a thousand divine years and then one day
Śiva and Pārvatī appeared before her and asked her
what she wanted. She then said “Oh, Bhagavan, Mahā-
viṣṇu cursed me and made me into a mare. He has
decreed that I would go back after bringing forth a son
as glorious as Viṣṇu. From whom am I to bear a son
like this?” Śiva promised to find a solution and going to
Vaikuṇṭha sent Viṣṇu to earth in the form of a horse.
Viṣṇu came to Lakṣmī and they lived together for some
time and soon a son was born to Lakṣmī. Leaving the
child in the forest both of them went back to Vai-
kuṇṭha. It is this child who later on became the famous
King, Ekavīra. It was because he was born of a horse
that he got the names, Hehaya and Haihaya. (Skandha
6, Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%How Ekavīra came to the palace.%} It was at this time that
Śatajit, son of the grandson of Yayāti was doing
penance to obtain a son. He was also doing penance
in the forest situated at a point where the rivers Kālindī
and Tamasā meet. One night a Vidyādhara named
Campaka came with a Vidyādharī named Madālasā
and seeing the infant lying helpless in the forest took
it to Devaloka. Indra recognised it as the child born to
Viṣṇu and Lakṣmī on earth while they were living as
horse and mare and so the Vidyādhara put it back on
earth in the same place as before. Immediately Lakṣmī-
Nārāyaṇas appeared before Śatajit doing penance there
and asking him to take care of a child lying helpless in
another side of the forest disappeared. Immensely
pleased at this Śatajit took the child to his palace and
brought him forth as his own son giving the child the
name Ekavīra. When the boy became a prince, Śatajit
crowned Ekavīra King and went to the forest with his
queen and after doing penance there for sometime
attained Viṣṇuloka. (Skandha 6, Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Ekavīra marries Ekāvalī.%} Once Prince Ekavīra
accompanied by the son of the minister went for a plea-
sure trip to the banks of the river Gaṅgā. It was spring
and the prince wandering about enjoying the sight of a
[Page269-b+ 60]
flowery forest was soon arrested by the sight of a
sweet smelling lotus with a hundred petals blooming in
the river. By the side of the lotus was standing a
beautiful damsel weeping. The prince went to her and
asked her the reason for her weeping. After great per-
suasion she replied thus: “Oh, Prince, there is a country
not far from yours which is now being ruled over by a
very righteous King called Raibhya. His queen is called
Rukmarekhā. They had no children for a very long
time and so Raibhya conducted a Putrakāmeṣṭi yāga.
When ghee was poured profusely into the sacrificial fire
the flames rose up to great heights and from inside the
flames came out a lovely maiden. The King named her
Ekāvalī and bought her forth as his daughter. I am
Yaśovatī the daughter of the minister there. We were
of the same age and so I was asked to live with her as
her companion. She was very fond of lotuses and the
King constructed big ponds with lotuses in them for
her recreation. Yet she used to go to other ponds also
in search of lotuses.
<div n="NI"/>One day we came to this side of the river Gaṅgā to
play. Then a demon of name Kālaketu came and kidnapp-
ed her. I followed her. She never surrendered to the
enticements and persuasions of Kālaketu. Her father
wanted her to be married to Ekavīra, King of Hehaya.
Kālaketu sent her to prison. Without knowing what to
do next I am standing here weeping.
<div n="NI"/>Hearing this Ekavīra went to Pātāla and defeating
Kālaketu released Ekāvalī and brought both Ekāvalī
and Yaśovatī to the palace of Raibhya. Pleased at this
Raibhya gave his daughter in marriage to Ekavīra.
Kārtavīryārjuna was born in the family of Ekavīra.
(Skandha 6, Devī Bhāgavata).
