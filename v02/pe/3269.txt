KAPAṬABHIKṢU¦. A false sage. To illustrate the fact
that if a man fails in his deceit he will be subjected to
ridicule, a story of a false sage occurs in Kathāsaritsā-
gara. Since this Character has earned a place in the
Indian literature his story is given below:
<div n="NI"/>There was once a city called Mākandī on the banks of
the river Gaṅgā. In that city lived a sage who
observed silence as a Vrata. One day when he went
begging he saw a beautiful girl in a Vaiśya's house and
the false ascetic was attracted by her. Breaking his
silence he said “What a pity!” and left the place. The
Vaiśya was worried why the sage said so and approached
him and asked why he broke his silence to say so. The
sage said: “Your daughter is ill-omened. If you give her
in marriage all of you remaining will perish. So pack her
in a box and with a torch burning on the top of it set it
afloat on the river.” The Vaiśya did so.
<div n="NI"/>The sage coming to his Āśrama called his disciples to
his side and said “To-night a box with a torch burning
on the top of it will come floating on the river. You
must take it and bring it to me without opening it.”
<div n="NI"/>The disciples went to the river and seeing the box
coming floating caught it and took it to their preceptor.
But from a point high up in the river a prince had seen
the box coming floating and had opened it. He had
then released the girl from the box and had floated the
box again filling it with a black monkey. When the
disciples got the box to the guru he said “Take it up-
stairs and keep it there. There is a Pūjā to be conduct-
[Page388-a+ 65]
ed with the recital of sacred verses. It should not be
seen by others. You can all go to sleep.”
<div n="NI"/>The false sage went up eager to enjoy the girl in the
box and opened the box with pleasant thoughts. But to
his utter horror there jumped from the box a ferocious
black monkey who mauled him terribly. The Kapaṭa-
bhikṣu was fooled. (Taraṅga 1. Lāvāṇakalambaka,
Kathāsaritsāgara).
