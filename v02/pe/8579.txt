VIVASVĀN I¦. The Sun.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Sūrya (Sun) has a large number
of synonyms. But prominence is given to two of them,
Mārtaṇḍa and Vivasvān in the Purāṇas. Twelve devas
were born to Prajāpati Kaśyapa by his wife Aditi. As
these twelve were the sons of Aditi they were called
Ādityas. The Dvādaśādityas (the twelve Ādityas) are
Viṣṇu, Śakra, Aryaman, Dhātā, Tvaṣṭā, Pūṣā Vivasvān,
Savitā, Mitra, Varuṇa, Aṃśu and Bhaga. These twelve
Ādityas were, in the previous Manvantara (Age of
Manu) of Manu Cākṣuṣa, twelve Devas called the
Tuṣitas. When the Cākṣuṣa Manvantara came to an
end and the Vaivasvata Manvantara was about to
begin, the twelve Tuṣitas met together and after a con-
sultation, they took birth as the sons of Aditi. In this
birth they were known by the name Dvādaśādityas.
(Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter 15).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The name Mārtaṇḍa.%} As Aditi was pregnant, Candra
went to the hermitage asking for alms. Due to her diffi-
culties of pregnancy Aditi was not in a position to rise
up instantly and greet the visitor. Candra thought that
it was due to disrespect. So he cursed her. Let the
child in your womb die.” At this Aditi became misera-
ble. Kaśyapa saw her crying incessantly and asked for
the cause. Aditi told him all that had happened.
Kaśyapa blessed her and said that the infant would not
die. Thus the child which was lying dead in the womb
came to life again. As the ‘aṇḍa’ (egg-embryo) of
Vivasvān went mṛta (died) by the curse of Candra, he
came to be called Mārtaṇḍa (he who has aṇḍa which
has become mṛta). When the child was born he was
given the name Vivasvān.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Family life.%} Vivasvān married Saṃjñā, the daughter
of Viśvakarmā. The first child born to Vivasvān by
Saṃjñā was Vaivasvata Manu. The Sūrya (Solar)
dynasty begins from this Vaivasvata Manu. Saṃjñā
again gave birth to two children Yama and Yamī. Then
finding it difficult to bear the fierce brightness of the
sun Saṃjñā gave her place to her maid Chāyā otherwise
called Savarṇā, and went to the house of her father.
Viśvakarmā did not like this action on the part of his
daughter. So Saṃjñā took the form of a mare and went
to the pastures of North Kuru. Thinking Chāyā to be
his wife Saṃjñā, Vivasvān went to bed with her. She
conceived and gave birth to two sons and a daughter.
The sons were named Sāvarṇi and Śani and the daughter
was named Tapatī. Chāyā loved her own children more.
The children of Saṃjñā were grieved at this. Yama once
lifted his leg to kick her. “Let that leg be broken.”
Chāyā cursed him. The miserable Yama ran to his
father and said. “Father, this mother hates us and loves
Sāvarṇi and Śani more. It is true that I lifted up my
leg. But my leg did not touch mother's head. Father, I
request you to pardon the wrong I have done because of
my ignorance. Have pity on me and tell me how to save
my leg from breaking.” Vivasvān said to Yama that his
leg would not be broken, but because of the curse worms
would bite his leg. Vivasvān understood that Chāyā
was not the real mother. He went to Viśvakarmā.
Viśvakarmā put Vivasvān on his turning machine and
by turning lessened his brightness. Vivasvān who was
made more handsome by turning, found out his wife
Saṃjñā, and approached her. But thinking him to be
somebody else she moved away from him. In the mean-
while two male persons were born from the nostrils of
[Page879-b+ 64]
Saṃjñā. There is another story that these two persons
were the Aśvinidevas. Vivasvān and Saṃjñā came home.
As a retribution for the wrong he had done, Yama
ruled over his subjects justly and earned the name
Dharmarāja. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 21; Bhaviṣya
Purāṇa, Chapter 47; Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter
171).
