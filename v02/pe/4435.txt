MATAṄGA I¦. An ancient sage. The Rāmāyaṇa in
Araṇya Kāṇḍa describes the āśrama of Mataṅga.
Rāmalakṣmaṇas after crossing the forest of Krauñca
came to the āśrama of Mataṅga. Kabandha was slain
at this place After abandoning his demoniac body
Kabandha extolled the greatness of Mataṅgāśrama
to Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa. “The flowers of this āśrama
are never plucked and worn on heads. Even if they are
not plucked they never fade. They remain fresh always.
There is a reason for this. The disciples of Mataṅga
once brought a heavy load of fruits for their guru and
when they reached the āśrama they were tired and
drops of perspiration fell on the plants and they became
flowers. Śabarī is performing penance in this aśrama.”
Mataṅga once cursed Bāli. It happened that while the
sage was living on the mountain of Ṛṣyamūka Bāli and
the asura Dundubhi fought against each other and
blood flowing from the body of Dundubhi by a blow
of Bāli spurted out and fell on the hands of the sage.
[Page493-a+ 64]
Mataṅga then cursed Bāli saying that his head would
blow off if he entered Ṛṣyamūkācala again. (Sarga 46,
Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa and Kamba
Rāmāyaṇa, Pūrva Kāṇḍa). Mataṅgāśrama was a holy
place. (Chapter 84, Vana Parva).
