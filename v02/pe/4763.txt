NĀRĀYAṆA¦. One of the two Ṛṣis famous as Naranārā-
yaṇas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Dharma, son of Brahmā was Nārāyaṇa's
father. Dharma married ten daughters of Dakṣa, and
four sons, i.e. Hari, Kṛṣṇa, Nara and Nārāyaṇa were
born to him of them. Of the four, Nara and Nārāyaṇa
were inseparable sannyāsins. In the holy Badarikāśrama
on the slopes of the Himālayas they did tapas to please
Brahmā for a thousand years.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Nārāyaṇa's tapas.%} The whole world was, so to say,
burnt by the intense tapas of Naranārāyaṇas. Indra
was alarmed. Believing that their tapas was for the
attainment of Indrahood and fearing his own displace-
ment Indra went to Badarikāśrama mounted on Airā-
vata to break their tapas, and told them thus: “Oh
ascetics, who shine like the rising sun, I am pleased with
your tapas. You may choose any boon you like.”
<div n="NI"/>The Naranārāyaṇas did not even recognise the thunder-
like voice of Indra; nor did they answer him. This
increased Indra's alarm, and he decided to disturb
them with Māyā, productive of fear, desire etc. and thus
break their tapas. Indra began threatening them
with cruel animals created by him like wild cat, leopard
tiger, lion, elephant etc. and also with aberrations
created in nature like storm, rain, wild fire etc. But,
none of the above affected or moved them in the least.
After all, why should they be moved? You would
threaten only those who are subject to desires, love of
comfort, any particular object in life or likes and dis-
likes. Since Naranārāyaṇas had none of the above, Indra's
attempts to threaten them failed. Thus disappointed he
returned to Svargaloka and after thinking for a long
time he called Kāmadeva to him and spoke as follows:—
“You should go, along with Rati and the spring, to
Badarikāśrama. Also take with you any number of
apsarā women you want. You will find Naranārāyaṇas
at the āśrama performing tapas and will weaken them
from their resolution by using your arrows (erotic shafts)
and tempt them into erotic life. I am also deputing
apsarā women like Rambhā to help you.”
<div n="NI"/>Kāmadeva accordingly started for Badarikāśrama
accompanied by all the apsarā women. When they
reached the place spring season had set in there.
<div n="NI"/>Varieties of beetles flew about from flower to flower
humming. Trees like the mango and Palāśa were thick
with flowers. Creepers (Comparable to young women)
entwined and embraced trees (lovers), the former
carrying puṣpas (flowers, in the case of young women,
coming of age). A fragrant breeze swept the whole
region. In this erotic background Kāma and Rati, with
their five arrows and accompanied by celestial women
came to the āśrama, and there they began singing and
dancing. The erotic flow enchanted the soul of Naranā-
rāyaṇas. Nārāyaṇarṣi awoke from his tapas and
whispered something in the ears of Nara. By now
Kāmadeva had entered the presence of Naranārāyaṇas
accompanied by the reputed beauties of Svarloka like
Menakā, Rambhā, Tilottamā, Sukeśinī, Manoramā,
Maheśvarī, Puṣpagandhā, Pramadvarā, Ghṛtācī,
Candraprabhā, Somaprabhā, Vidyunmālā, Ambujākṣī
and Kāñcanamālā. These beauties were accompanied
by 10080 of their beautiful attendants. Naranārāyaṇas
[Page533-a+ 64]
were wonder-struck to see this army of Kāma. All those
great beauties stood before Naranārāyaṇas in salutation.
Some of them began to sing, others to dance and yet
others to take up the tunes. Nārayaṇarṣi could easily
divine the reason for the show. He thought to himself
thus—
<div n="NI"/>“None but Devendra could have sent all these people
here, and his object must be to hinder our tapas. But I
shall prove to Indra that all these mean nothing to me.
Let Devendra understand that I can create more
beautiful ladies than these women of his here and that
I am not in the least attracted by any of them here.”
<div n="NI"/>Thinking thus Nārāyaṇa beat gently on his thigh and
immediately arose therefrom an exceptionally beautiful
woman. Since that woman, the most beautiful in all the
three worlds, was created from the Ūru (thigh) of
Nārāyaṇa she came to be known as Urvaśī. Others were
wonder-struck by this new creation. He created
some other beauties also, and an equal number of
other women to serve them. All of them stood before
him in humble salutation.
<div n="NI"/>The celestial women almost fainted with fear. In re-
pentance they begged the munis pardon for their
mistake. The munis were kindly disposed towards them.
They told them that they (munis) cherished no
animosity towards them, but in fact were pleased with
them, and they further asked them (celestial women)
to choose their boons. The munis also asked them to
take Urvaśī to Devaloka as a present from them to Indra.
Let the Devas prosper.
<div n="NI"/>Having heard Nara speak like this the celestial women
returned in great humility to Devaloka with Urvaśī
and the other women. (Devī Bhāgavata, 4th Skandha).
