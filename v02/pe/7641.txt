TUṢITAS¦. There were twelve good devas called Tuṣitas
in the Cākṣuṣa Manvantara. When the Cākṣuṣa Man-
vantara ended and the Vaivasvata Manvantara com-
menced all the twelve were born as sons of Kaśyapa of
his wife Aditi. Because they were born of Aditi they
were called Dvādaśādityas. They were Viṣṇu etc. Thus
the Tuṣitas of the Cākṣuṣa Manvantara were the
Dvādaśādityas of Vaivasvata Manvantara. (Viṣṇu
Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter 15).
