MĀGADHAS¦. A particular tribe of people. If the work
of Sūtas was to drive chariots and the work of Pulkasas
to hunt, the work of the Māgadhas was that of an
adulator. (Chapter 151, Agni Purāṇa). This work of
a flatterer was given to them by Brahmā. When the
[Page461-a+ 65]
emperor Pṛthu was born, Brahmā conducted a Yāga.
On the day of sutyā at the place of Somābhiṣava of the
Yāga a very intelligent Sūta was born. At the same yāga
a Māgadha also was born. He was a great scholar. Then
the sages told Māgadha and Sūta thus: “Praise this king
Pṛthu, who is the valorous son of Vena. Praising is the
fittest work suited to you both. Pṛthu deserves praise.”
<div n="NI"/>Then the Sūta-Māgadhas placing their hands on their
breasts with respect said, “What do we know of the
qualities and capabilities of a king just born? His fame
is not known. Based on what should we sing praises of
him?” Hearing this the sages said that they should
praise him for the qualities which he would be possess-
ing in future. The king was pleased to hear that. Sūta-
Māgadhas started singing eulogistic songs based on the
qualities and exploits of a Pṛthu to be. Pṛthu then
appointed Sūta as his charioteer and Māgadha as his
adulator. From then onwards the Sūta family became
charioteers and the Māgadha family flatterers. (Chap-
ters 13—70 Aṃsa 1, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
