OGHAVATĪ I¦. There are seven Sarasvatī rivers in the
world. These are Suprabhā, Kāñcanākṣī, Viśālā,
Manoramā, Sarasvatī, Oghavatī and Sureṇu. In the
Mahābhārata, Śalya Parva, Chapter 38 we find that
Oghavatī was invoked and brought to Kurukṣetra. It
was on the bank of this Oghavatī that Bhīsma fell and
lay on the Śaraśayyā. (Bed of arrows). (M.B. Śānti
Parva, Chapter 50, Verse 5).
