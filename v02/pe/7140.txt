SUNDA¦. An asura. He had a brother named Upasunda,
and their father was Niśumbha alias Jharjha. Sunda
and Upasunda were very cruel asuras.
<div n="NI"/>The two brothers performed tapas on the Vindhya
mountain with the object of conquering the three
worlds. All attempts made by Devas to break up their
penance failed and ultimately Brahmā appeared before
them. They secured from Brahmā a boon to the effect
that they would not be killed by anyone else but only
mutually by them. Swollen-headed by the boon the
brothers conquered the three worlds and none could
kill them. Ultimately the Devas sent Tilottamā, the
celestial damsel to them and she made them quarrel
with each other. Both of them who fell in love with
Tilottamā and wanted her as wife fought with each
other and got killed. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 221, Verse
19). For details see under Upasunda and Tāṭakā).
