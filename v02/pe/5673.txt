famous in history. After the great war was over,
Nārada once narrated the stories of sixteen kings to
Dharmaputra. There are a number of stories relating
to Rantideva's kindness, hospitality etc. He had enga-
ged 20,000 people to cook food for guests who came to
the palace everyday. He was very vigilant about treat-
ing guests day and night alike. He gifted away all
wealth which had been righteously earned, to brahmins.
He learned Vedas and subdued enemies by Dharma
(righteousness). The very blood that flowed from the skin
of cattle killed to entertain his guests formed itself into
a river called Carmaṇvati. (Śānti Parva, Chapter 29.

Parva, Chapter 67).
