KADRŪ¦. Wife of Kaśyapa and daughter of Dakṣaprajā-
pati.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus:—Viṣṇu—
Brahmā—Dakṣa—Kadrū.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Kadrū—Wife or daughter of Kaśyapa?%} Whether Kadrū
was the wife or daughter of Kaśyapa is a question which
remains unanswered still in the Purāṇas. Chapter 65 of
Bhāṣā Bhārata states like this.
<div n="NI"/>The six spiritual sons of Brahmā are: Marīci, Aṅgiras,
Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha and Kratu. Marīci got a son
named Kaśyapa and he married the thirteen daughters
of Dakṣa, namely, Aditi, Diti, Kalā, Danāyus, Danu,
Siṃhikā, Krodhā, Pradhā, Viśvā, Vinatā, Kapilā, Muni
and Kadrū. So according to this, Kadrū was the wife of
Kaśyapa.
<div n="NI"/>But the 14th Sarga of Araṇya Kāṇḍa of Vālmīki Rāmā-
yaṇa states:
<div n="NI"/>Dakṣaprajāpati got sixty illustrious daughters and of
these Kaśyapa married—Aditi, Diti, Danu, Kālikā
Tāmrā, Krodhavaśā, Muni and Surasā. Krodhavaśā
gave birth to eight daughters. They were: Mṛgī, Mṛga-
mandā, Harī, Bhadramatā, Mātaṅgī, Śārdūlī, Śvetā;
Śurabhi, Surasā and Kadrū.
<div n="NI"/>Tāmrā another wife of Kaśyapa gave birth to five
daughters, namely, Krauñcī, Bhāsī, Śyenī, Dhṛtarāṣṭrī
and Śukī. Krauñcī gave birth to owls, Bhāsī to Bhāsas,
Śyenī to eagles and vultures, Dhṛtarāṣṭrī to swans and
Śukī to Natā. Natā gave birth to Vinatā.
<div n="NI"/>Thus, according to the Rāmāyaṇa Kadrū was the
daughter of Kaśyapa born of his wife Krodhavaśā.
Again Vinatā who is spoken of as the elder sister of
Kadrū in Mahābhārata is the daughter of the grand-
daughter of Kaśyapa. This means that Kadrū's mother
and Vinatā's grand mother's mother were sisters. But
[Page363-b+ 64]
both of them looked after Kaśyapa as if they were
direct sisters.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Kadrū, mother of serpents.%} Kadrū and Vinatā lived
serving Kaśyapa. Kaśyapa was pleased with them and
asked them what boon they wanted. Kadrū asked for a
thousand serpents to be born of her and Vinatā asked
for two sons who would be braver and more brilliant
than the sons of Kadrū. Kaśyapa granted them what
they asked for and when Kadrū and Vinatā became
pregnant he left for the forest.
<div n="NI"/>After some time Kadrū delivered a thousand eggs and
Vinatā two eggs. Both of them kept the eggs in warm
jars and after five hundred years the thousand eggs of
Kadrū burst letting out a thousand serpents. Vinatā
became impatient and broke open an egg of hers. Out
came from it a half developed being and that was
Aruṇa. Aruṇa cursed her for being impatient and said
“You let me out half developed because of your over-
anxiety and you will, therefore, become a servant of
Kadrū. Keep the other egg for another five hundred
years. Then a very powerful son will come out of it
and that son will relieve you of your servitude to
Kadrū”. So saying he rose up in the air and became
the charioteer of the sun. After five hundred years the
other egg of Vinatā broke and Garuḍa came out.

<div n="NI"/>5) {%Kadrū curses her sons.%} Once Kadrū called Vinatā to
her side and asked her the colour of Uccaiśśravas, the
horse of Indra. It was purely a white horse and Vinatā
told so. But Kadrū said its tail was black. Each stood
firm in her statement and then Kadrū made a bet. She
who was defeated in the bet should serve the other as
her slave. Vinatā agreed. Kadrū wanted to cheat Vinatā
and so asked her sons to remain suspended from the
tail of the horse in such an artful way that the tail
would look black from a distance. Some of her sons re-
fused to be a party to this deceit and Kadrū cursed
them saying that they would all be burnt in the Sarpa-
sattra of Janamejaya. Kaśyapa did not like the curse.
But Brahmā came there and said that the serpents
as a class were injurious to society and as such a curse
of that nature was necessary. Brahmā then taught him
Viṣasaṃhāravidyā (Treatment of snake-poisoning).
(Chapter 20, Ādi Parva, M.B.).

6) {%Kadrū and children go to Rāmaṇīyaka.%} Once Kadrū
told Vinatā. “Vinatā, take me to the island of Rāma-
ṇīyaka in the middle of the ocean. It is a beautiful place
to stay. Let your son, Garuḍa, take my sons to that
place.” Vinatā took Kadrū and Garuḍa took her
children during the journey. Garuḍa rose high up in the
air nearing the sun and the serpents began to feel the
heat unbearable and began to get charred. Kadrū then
prayed to Indra and the latter then sent a heavy down-
pour of rains. This saved the serpents from being burnt
to death and they reached the island of Rāmaṇīyaka
safe. (Chapters 25 and 26, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
