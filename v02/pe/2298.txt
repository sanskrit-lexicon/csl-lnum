GADĀDHARA¦. A synonym of Mahāviṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>There is a place called Gayā to the north of Mount
Kālañjara to the south of Himālayas, to the east of
Kuśasthalī and to the west of Vasupura. Once a king
called Gaya conducted at Gayā an Aśvamedha, a Nara-
medha (yajña at which man is offered as sacrifice) and
a Mahāmedha and Mahāviṣṇu acted as gate-keeper of
Gaya. As Viṣṇu stood guard there holding the gadā
(club) in his hands he came to be known as Gadādhara
also thenceforth. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 76).
