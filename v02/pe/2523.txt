GUHA¦. King of the country of Niṣādas alias Śṛṅgi-
verapura, on the banks of the river Gaṅgā. Śrī Rāma
when he went on exile to the forests went to the resi-
dence of Guha accompanied by Lakṣmaṇa and Sītā.
Guha, a devotee of Rāma, received them with respect
offering them many kinds of fruits and roots to eat.
But Śrī Rāma said that it was not proper to accept
fruits and roots and so he drank only pure water from
him. But Guha was asked to feed his horse. At night
when Lakṣmaṇa stood watch over Rāma and Sītā, Guha
volunteered to stand guard but Lakṣmaṇa refused to
accept the offer. So Guha kept company with Lakṣmaṇa
and both of them spent the night talking to each other.
In the morning as per Rāma's request Guha brought
a canoe and Guha himself took Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa and
[Page301-b+ 64]
Sītā to the other side of the river. (Sarga 50, Vālmīki
Rāṃāyaṇa, Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>Guha is seen next when Bharata comes to the forest in
search of Rāma. When Bharata returned from Kekaya
he went in search of Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa and came
to Guha in Śṛṅgiverapura. Guha then gave Bharata all
available information regarding Śrī Rāma. Guha then
sent the Dāśa army along with Bharata. (Sarga 84,
Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>Guha, chief of Śṛṅgiverapura, spent the night with
Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa under an Oka tree. (Chapter 6,
Agni Purāṇa).
