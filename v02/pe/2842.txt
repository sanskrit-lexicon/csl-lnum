JĀMBAVĀN¦. A monkey of extraordinary might. He
was the minister of Sugrīva.
<F>1) It is difficult to ascertain whether Jāmbavān was a monkey or a bear. In some of the Indian languages he is described as a
monkey. In Malayālaṃ he was thought of as a monkey from ancient period. In Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, which is the original work, Jāmba-
vān is denoted by the words ‘Kapi’ (monkey) and Rkṣa (bear). Jāmbavān is called Ṛkṣapuṅgava in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa Bālakāṇḍa
Sarga 17. From this it is to be assumed that Jāmbavān was a bear. In the same chapter it occurs that, it was the aim of Brahmā to
make the gods and the celestial women take birth as monkeys to help Mahāviṣṇu in the incarnation of Śrī Rāma. So it is not
wrong to consider Jāmbavān either as a bear or as a monkey.</F>
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} When the troubles and hardships caused by
the wickedness of Rāvaṇa became unbearable the
goddess Earth and the Devas approached Brahmā for
redress. Brahmā took them to the sea of Milk. Mahā-
visṇu heard everything and said that he would incarnate
as the son of Daśaratha and would kill Rāvaṇa. Brahmā
was directed to create monkeys to help him on that
occasion. Accordingly Brahmā created Jāmbavān and
several other monkeys.
[Page341-b+ 59]
There are two stories about the birth of Jāmbavān in the
Purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>(1) Brahmā sat for a long time thinking about the
creation of monkeys. Then he wanted to yawn., for
which he opened the mouth and instantly Jāmbavān
came out from inside Brahmā through the open mouth.
“I have already created Jāmbayān the noble bear, who
jumped out of my mouth when I yawned.” (Vālmīki
Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, Sarga 17, Stanza 6).
<div n="NI"/>(2) One day time of Brahmā ended and the night had
advanced two yāmas (six hours). The Madhukaiṭabhas
born of the ear-wax of Mahāviṣṇu began to create
trouble and commotion in the waters of the great flood.
They saw a lotus on the surface of water. Seeing Brahmā
in it they challenged him for fight. Hearing their shout-
ing and the challenge Brahmā became afraid of the
asuras. His middle face began to sweat. The sweat
flowed through his cheeks and reached the loins. Jāmba-
vān came into being from that sweat. So he got the
name Ambujāta, (born from the water of sweat). As
he was the first person who entered the country of
Jāmbūnada he was called Jāmbavān. As he was born
when there was no universe or time his age or date
of birth could not be ascertained. At the time of Śrī
Rāma Jāmbavān was six Manvantaras (age of a Manu)
and for hundred and sixtyfour Caturyugas (a period of
four yugas) old. (The present age is the twenty-eighth
Caturyuga of the seventh Manu). Jāmbavān had wit-
nessed all the incarnations from Matsya to Śrī Rāma.
(Kamba Rāmāyaṇa Pūrva Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Jāmbavān and the incarnation of Śrī Rāma.%} During the
time of Śrī Rāma Jāmbavān was the minister of
Sugrīva. It is stated in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā
Kāṇḍa, Sarga 41, that Nīla, the son of Agni, Hanūmān,
Jāmbavān, Suhotra, Sarāri, Śaragulma, Gaja, Gavākṣa,
Gavaya, Suṣeṇa, Ṛṣabha, Mainda, Dvivida, Vijaya,
Gandhamādana, Ulkāmukha, Asaṅga, Aṅgada and
others were the ministers of Sugrīva.
<div n="NI"/>The monkeys who went to the south in search of Sītā,
reached the sea shore. The question was how to jump
over the sea to Laṅkā. Each of them came forward to
show his ability and admitted failure. Finally Jāmbavān
called Hanūmān to him and advised him to jump over
to Laṅkā. Hanūmān who was not aware of his own
powers,
<F>2) For the cause of his forgetting his own powers see under Trṇabindu II.</F> refused. Jāmbavān told him about his birth,
self-power, attainment of boons etc. Hanūmān became
convinced of his powers at the words of Jāmbavān and
jumped over the sea to Laṅkā. (Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā
Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Jāmbavān and the incarnation of Vāmana.%} Jāmbavān
walked round Mahāviṣṇu, who incarnated as Vāmana
to curb the powers of Mahābali. At that time
Jāmbavān was immensely strong. But by the time of
the incarnation of Śrī Rāma his strength had decreased
much. Hear what he said to the monkeys who as-
sembled on the sea shore to go in search of Sītā.
<div n="NI"/>“My abilities in olden times were not what you see
now. In the far old days, I had walked round that
[Page342-a+ 65]
Eternal Being Viṣṇu when he measured three steps at
the sacrifice of Mahābali. Now, I am very old and
have not enough strength to jump over the sea.”
(Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā kāṇḍa, Sarga 65).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Jāmbavān and the incarnation of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.%} The long-
living Jāmbavān who had witnessed nine out of the
ten incarnations of Mahāviṣṇu is seen in connection
with the precious stone Syamantaka, in the incarnation
of Kṛṣṇa. The Sun-god gave this jewel Syamantaka to
King Satrājit. His younger brother Prasena wore it
and went to the forest for hunting. A lion killed him
and took the jewel in his mouth and was going along
the forest when Jāmbavān killed it and took the jewel.
It was rumoured that Srī Kṛṣṇa had killed Prasena
and taken the jewel. So Śrī Kṛṣṇa went in search of
the jewel to the forest, defeated Jāmbavān and took the
jewel, and returned it to Satrājit. Śrī Kṛṣṇa married
Jāmbavatī the daughter of Jāmbavān. (Bhāgavata,
Skandha 10).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Jāmbavān became old for ever.%} At the time of the
incarnation of Vāmana, Jāmbavān was very strong
and valiant. When Vāmana brought under control the
three worlds by measuring three steps Jāmbavān
travelled throughout the three worlds carrying the news
everywhere. Within three moments Jāmbavān
travelled eighteen times through the three worlds. In
this travel of lightning-speed the end of the nail of his
toe touched the highest peak of Mahāmeru, who
considered it as an insult and said “You are arrogant
of your speed and youth. Hereafter your body will
not reach where your mind reaches and you shall be
ever old.” Because of this curse Jāmbavān became old
and unable to carry out what he wished. (Kamba
Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa).
