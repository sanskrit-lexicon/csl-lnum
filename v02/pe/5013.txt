PARABRAHMAN¦. The Supreme Spirit.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Brahman is the root cause of
this universe. From Brahman originated Ākāśa (sky).
From sky came air, from air came Agni and from
Agni came water and from water was born this earth.
(Chapter 377, Agni Purāṇa).
[Page567-a+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>2) {%General characteristics.%} Brahman is such that he who
says he knows it does not know it and he who says he
does not know it, knows it. It is beyond the experiences
of time and space. The chief attributes of Brahman
are Sat, Cit and Ānanda. Sat means existence, the
really existent truth. The one and undivided existence.
There are pandits who say that it was undivided,
Nāstitva (nonexistence) that was at the beginning
of the Universe. Since nothing can be born from
‘nothing’ the world should have started from astitva
(existence). There is a saying in Ṛgveda explaining
the position thus:—“There was neither Astitva nor
Nāstitva (existence or non-existence) at the beginning.”
It is a matter to ponder how strongly conscious was
the Ṛṣi who made the above statement about the
Parabrahman's Nirguṇatva (devoid of attributes) and
how clearly he tries to make it understandable to
those who have not experienced the idea.
<div n="NI"/>Cit means knowledge, splendour, consciousness. Ānanda
means bliss. Paul Deussen writes that the ancient
Upaniṣads do not include in the definition of Brahman
the term ‘ānanda’.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The two forms of Brahman.%} Brahman has two forms—
Parabrahman and Aparabrahman. Parabrahman is
Amūrta (formless, incorporeal) and Aparabrahman is
Mūrta (embodied, corporeal). The Amūrta Brahman
is known by such names as Parabrahman, Paramātmā
and Nirguṇabrahman. The corporeal or material
Brahman is Aparabrahman and thus this whole world
is Aparabrahman.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The Upaniṣads about Brahman.%}
<Poem>Aśabdamasparśamarūpamavyayaṃ
Tathāsrasaṃ nityamagandhavacca yat /
Anādyanantaṃ mahataḥ paraṃ dhruvaṃ
Vicārya tanmṛtyumukhāt pramucyate //
(Kaṭhopaniṣad)</Poem>
(With no sound, touch, form, taste or smell, with
neither beginning nor end Brahman is imperishable).
Na tatra cakṣurgacchati na vāk gacchati no mano
Na vidmo na vijānīmo yathaitadanuśiṣyate /
Anyadeva tadviditādatho aviditādadhi
Iti śuśruma pūrveṣāṃ ye nastadvyācacakṣire.
(Muṇḍakopaniṣad)
(No eye goes there, no word goes there, no mind, no
intelligence—we do not see it, we cannot describe it—
you cannot imagine it nor can you understand it—It
is distinct from the known and above the unknown.
We have heard it spoken thus).
<Poem>Yasyāmataṃ tasya mataṃ mataṃ yasya na veda saḥ /
Avijñātaṃ vijānatāṃ vijñātam avijānatām. //</Poem>
(Kenopaniṣad)
(He understands It who comprehends It not; and he
understands It not who feels he has understood. It is
the unknown to those who have acquired real know-
ledge while it is the known to those who are ignorant
of true knowledge).
<Poem>Yat cakṣuṣā na paśyati
Yena cakṣūṃṣi paśyati /
Tadeva Brahma tvaṃ viddhi
Nedaṃ yadidamupāsate. //</Poem>
(Kenopaniṣad).
(That which is not seen by the eye but that by which
the eyes are able to see—That alone is Brahman and
not that which people do worship here, do know that).
[Page567-b+ 65]
Yato vāco nivartante
Aprāpya manasā saha. (Taittirīya Upaniṣad).
Avijñātaṃ Vijānatāṃ vijñātam avijānatām.
(Kenopaniṣad)
(It is unknown to people who think they know but
known to those who did not profess to know it).
Naiva vācā na manasā prāptuṃ śakyo na cakṣuṣā /
Astīti bruvatosnyatra kathaṃ tadupalakṣyate. //
(Kaṭhopaniṣad)
(It is not possible to reach it by speech, mind or the
eyes. How is it to be identified; or described?)—
Digdeśaguṇādiphalabhedaśūnyaṃ hi paramārtha—
Sat tad advayaṃ Brahma mandabuddhīnām asadiva
pratibhāti.
(Śaṅkarācārya).
The sublime Truth (Brahman) is beyond time, place
and attributes. Brahman is one (not two) and it is
Sat (existent) but for the dull-witted, ignorant people
it is Asat (non-existent).
Satyamevopāsate, tadetat tryakṣaraṃ satyamiti;
Sa ityekamakṣaram, tya ityeka.
makṣaram, prathamottame akṣare satyam madhyato
Anṛtaṃ tadetatamṛtamubhayataḥ satyena pari-
gṛhītaṃ satyabhūyameva bhavati.
(Bṛhadāraṇyaka).
Kohamasmīti satyamiti brūyāt kiṃ tad yat
Satyamiti yadanyad devebhyaśca prāṇebhyaśca /
Tatsadatha yaddevāśca prāṇāśca tad utade-
Ṭayāpicābhivyāhriyate satyamitye
Tadāpatitaṃ sarvamidam
(Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa).
<Poem>Idaṃ sarvaṃ khalu brahma iti śānta upāsīta
Antarhṛdaye eṣa me ātmā manomayaḥ
Prāṇaśarīraḥ bhārūpaḥ satyasaṅkalpaḥ ākā-
śātmā sarvakarmā sarvakāmaḥ sarvagandhaḥ sarva-
midamabhyatti.
