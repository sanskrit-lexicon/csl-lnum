SAPTARṢIS¦. (The seven hermits). A group of hermits.
There are seven hermits in this group. The Saptarṣis
in each Manvantara (age of Manu) are different. As
there are fourteen Manvantaras before a great deluge,
by that time ninety-eight Saptarṣis will be born and
dead. The father of the Saptarṣis in each Manu's age
will be different. The Saptarṣis of the present Manu's
age, Marīci, Aṅgiras, Atri, Pulastya, Vasiṣṭha, Pulaha
and Kratu are the mental sons of Brahmā. (For further
details see under the word Manvantara).
