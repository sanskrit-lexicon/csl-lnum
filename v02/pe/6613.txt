SINDHU I¦. A river in India, very famous in the
Purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} It is assumed in the Purāṇas
that this river is a branch of the heavenly Gaṅgā. By
the efforts of Bhagīratha, the heavenly Gaṅgā fell on
the earth in the Lake Bindu. After that it had six
channels. Three channels flowed to the east and three
to the west. The rivers which flowed to the East were
Hlādinī, Pāvanī and Nalinī. The three rivers Sucakṣus,
Sītā and Sindhu flowed to the west. This seventh branch
followed Bhagīratha and flowed to Pātāla to perform
obsequies to the sons of Sagara.
