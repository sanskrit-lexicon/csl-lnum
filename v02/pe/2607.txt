<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} See under Triśaṅku.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%A brief life-sketch.%} To keep his plighted word and
for the sake of truth he gifted away the whole of his
kingdom to Viśvāmitra. When that was not sufficient
he cleared his debts to Viśvāmitra with the money got
by selling his wife, Candramatī, his son, Lohitāśva and
finally himself. And, he earned his livelihood with the
wages he got for cremating corpses, himself doing
duties as guard at a burning ghat and as the slave to a
Cāṇḍāla. Ultimately the Trimūrtis (Brahmā, Viṣṇu and
Śiva) appeared and heaped on him all the boons he
desired and rewarded him with high honours. (See for
details para 4 under Viśvāmitra).
