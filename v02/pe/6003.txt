ŚĀLIHOTRA¦. A muni of ancient days. Vyāsa had once
lived in his āśrama. There was a tree near the āśrama
which had outlived time. A drink of the water in the
pond here quenches hunger and thirst. The tree and the
pond were created by the power of Śālihotra's tapas.
The Pāṇḍavas, during their life in exile in the forest,
visited this place in the company of Hiḍimbī and
quenched their hunger and thirst by drinking water
from this pond. (M.B., Southern text, Chapter 154).
[Page674-a+ 65]
Śālihotra was an adept in aśvasastra (science about
horses). To bathe in the tīrtha called Śālisūrya creat-
ed by the muni is to derive the same result as that of
making a gift of a thousand cows. (Vana Parva, Chap-
ter 71, Verse 27 and Chapter 83, Verse 107).
