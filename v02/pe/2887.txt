Kṛṣṇa mantra (a spell) called ‘Aṣṭākṣarī’ and the
Śrī Kṛṣṇa Kavaca (the armour of Kṛṣṇa) called
Trailokyamaṅgala’ and taught her how to use them in
worship. Wearing this armour and using the spell she
performed penance in Puṣkara, meditating upon Śrī
Kṛṣṇa Paramātmā, for three yugas (world ages). At
the end of this period Śrī Kṛṣṇa Paramātmā appeared

ed and that she had power to give boons to her
worshippers.

Manasādevī in marriage to Jaratkāru, a hermit. As they
were living in the hermitage, once the hermit slept
with his head on the lap of his wife. Seeing the setting
sun she aroused her husband. The hermit became
[Page349-b+ 65]
angry and decided to reject her. She thought of the
Devas, who instantly arrived. Brahmā argued that it
was not meet and right to reject his wife before a
child was born to her. The hermit touched the groin of
his wife and prayed and with the power of yoga (medi-
tation, contemplation etc.) she became pregnant. The
son born to her is the famous hermit Āstīka.
<div n="NI"/>After giving birth to Āstīka she went to Kailāsa, where

of this mantra as given above will be equal to Dhan-
vantari (the physician of the Gods) and to him poison

invoked into a secluded room on the day of Saṅkrānti
(Transit of the Sun). If offerings of oblations and
