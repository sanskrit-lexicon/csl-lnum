KĀLABRĀHMAṆA¦. A brahmin, who defeated Kāla.
A great effulgence that emanated from his head two
hundred years after his continuous Japa (Chanting of
mantras) blocked the passage of sky-walkers (Devas)
and spread to the three worlds. When Brahmā and
[Page371-a+ 64]
others asked him to choose any boon, he said that he
wanted nothing but chanting the Lord's name and
mantras. Again, Brahmā insisted on the brahmin's
choosing some boon or other, and then he removed
himself to the northern planes of the Himālayas, where
also he continued chanting mantras. There too his efful-
gence became so powerful that Indra deputed celestial
women to obstruct his Japa, but they could do nothing
in the matter. Then Indra deputed Kāla to end the
brahmin's life, but he failed in the attempt. Ultimately
King Ikṣvāku came to the brahmin and asked for half
the power he had earned by his tapas, which the
brahmin readily granted. And, Ikṣvāku became thus
famous all over the worlds. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Sūrya-
prabhālambaka).
