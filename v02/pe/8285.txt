VIDYUNMĀLĪ II¦. A mighty and brave Rākṣasa who
was a friend of Rāvaṇa. After the death of Rāvaṇa,
this asura, who lived in the Pātāla (underworld) stole
away the sacrificial horse of Śrī Rāma to avenge the
death of Rāvaṇa. Śatrughna killed Vidyunmālī and
redeemed the sacrificial horse. (Padma Purāṇa, Pātāla
