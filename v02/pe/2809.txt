JAḌA¦. An immoral brahmin. Jaḍa, who set out to do
commercial business once was killed by thieves. As a
result of sins committed in previous births he was turned
into a Piśāca. After his death his son, who led quite a
moral life went to Kāśī (Banares) to perform his father's
obsequies, and at the particular spot where his father
was living as Piśāca the son recited Chapter 3 of the
Gītā, on hearing which Jaḍa got released from his state
as Piśāca. (Padma Purāṇa, Uttarakhaṇḍa and Mār-
kaṇḍeya Purāṇa).
