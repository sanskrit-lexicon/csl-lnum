SUTĪKṢṆA¦. A hermit. While Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa
were living in the forest with Sītā, they visited the hermi-
of hermits such as Śarabhaṅga, Sutīkṣṇa and others.
Once Indra came to the hermitage of Sutīkṣṇa and
invited him to the world of gods. It was at this time
that Śrī Rāma came to the hermitage with Sītā and
Lakṣmaṇa. When they were nearing the hermitage,
Indra said “I shall see Rāma later when he has complet-
ed his great task.” Saying thus Indra went away from
the hermitage. Śrī Rāma and his wife and brother

asked the hermit, where in the forest, they were to live.
The hermit told them that they could live in that her-
mitage itself.
<div n="NI"/>This hermit was the brother and disciple of Agastya.
Once Sutīkṣṇa changed a wicked and cruel man
named Duṣpaṇya to a good and righteous man by sprin-
kling holy water of Gaṅgā on him. (See under Duṣ-
paṇya). (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇya Kāṇḍa, Sarga 7).
