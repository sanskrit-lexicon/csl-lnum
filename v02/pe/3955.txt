LAKṢMĪ I¦. Consort of Mahāviṣṇu.
[Page449-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin.%} Devī originated from the left side of
Paramātmā (Supreme Being). The beautiful Devī by
a command from the Supreme Being divided herself
into two enchanting damsels both equal in figure,
splendour, age, majesty, adornment and love. One of
these was Lakṣmīdevī and the other Rādhādevī. That
born of the left was Ramā and that of the right, Rādhā.
Rādhā wedded herself to the two-handed Śrī Kṛṣṇa
and Lakṣmī also wanted the same person and so Bhaga-
vān himself became two, Śri Kṛṣṇa from the left side
as a two-handed person and as four-handed
Viṣṇu from the right side. (9th Skandha. Devī
Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Different incarnations of Lakṣmī.%} Lakṣmī had many
incarnations and she had been on earth in different
forms at different times. They are given below:
<div n="NI"/>(i) {%Birth from the ocean of milk.%} Once the Devas
became aged and afflicted with rugosity and
grey hairs by a curse of Durvāsas. Indra lost his
majesty and was ousted from Svarga. Svargalakṣmī
deserted Devaloka and went to Vaikuṇṭha and merged
with Mahālakṣmī.
<div n="NI"/>The Devas were greatly aggrieved on account of this
plight of theirs and they went to Satyaloka and
appealed to Brahmā to find a solution to their difficult-
ies. Brahmā was helpless in the matter and so they
all together went to Vaikuṇṭha and represented their
grievances before Mahāviṣṇu. Viṣṇu smiled and told
Mahālakṣmī thus: “You go and be born as Kṣīra-
sāgarakanyakā using a part of your inherent power
and do give relief to the Devas.” Accordingly when
the Devas conducted the churning of the ocean of milk
(Kṣīrābdhimathana) Mahālakṣmī, the goddess of
beauty, wealth and prosperity arose from the ocean as
Kṣīrasāgarakanyakā (Daughter of the ocean of milk)
and blessed the Devas and put a Vanamālā (garland
of wild flowers) on Mahāviṣṇu. The Devas got back
all their lost wealth and prosperity and they, on going
to Devaloka, worshipped Lakṣmīdevī properly. (9th
Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Mahālakṣmī was born as a mare. (See under
Ekavīra, Para 2).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Mahālakṣmī was born as the Tulasī plant (Holy
Basil. (See under Tulasī.)
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Mahālakṣmī was born as Sītā and Vedavatī. (See
under Sītā).
<div n="NI"/>(v) {%Other births:%} Mahālakṣmī was born as a daughter
to the sage Bhṛgu of Khyāti. When Mahāviṣṇu
incarnated as Sūrya, Lakṣmī rose up from the lotus.
When Viṣṇu became Paraśurāma, Lakṣmī became
the earth. When Mahāviṣṇu incarnated as Śrī Rāma,
Lakṣmī became Sītā and when Viṣṇu was born as Kṛṣṇa
Lakṣmī became Rādhā. Thus whenever and wherever
Mahāviṣṇu changed his form, Mahālakṣmī also chang-
ed hers to form part of the changed life. (Chapter 9,
Aṃśa 1, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Mahālakṣmī cursed Viṣṇu.%} Once Mahālakṣmī cursed
Mahāviṣṇu, her husband, that his head would drop off
from his body. (See under Cital).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Two forms of Lakṣmī.%} Mahālakṣmī has two forms,
Viṣṇu-priyā Lakṣmī and Rājyalakṣmī. The former is the
embodiment of chastity and virtuousness. The latter
goes about courting Kings. Rājyalakṣmī is fickle and
unsteady. This Lakṣmī enters all places where virtue
and charity are found and as soon as these two vanish
[Page450-a+ 62]
from any place Rājyalakṣmī will also vanish from that
place.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Lakṣmī in cow-dung.%} The people of Bhārata consider
cow dung as very sacred and there is a story in the 82nd
Chapter of Anuśāsana Parva as to how cow-dung be-
came so sacred;
<div n="NI"/>Once a herd of cows was grazing in a large grassy ground
when Lakṣmī happened to pass that way. Mahālakṣmī
was pleased at the cows and bade them ask for any boon
they wanted. The cows were prosperity incarnate and
contented and they rejected the offer of Lakṣmī and
when pressed again by her, said that they would like to
have prosperity deposited in their dung also. Mahā-
lakṣmī did so and so even today it is believed that the
cowdung is embedded with prosperity.
<div n="NI"/>6). {%Other details:%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Lakṣmī stays in the court of Kubera. (Śloka 19,
Chapter 10, Sabhā Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Mahālakṣmī is installed in temples as an idol carrying
a lotus in her right hand and a Bilva fruit in her left
hand. (Chapter 50, Agni Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Lakṣmīdevī stays in the court of Brahmā also.
(Śloka 41, Chapter 11, Sabhā Parva).
