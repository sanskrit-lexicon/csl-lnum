ŚUṢKA¦. A Maharṣi who lived in the Gokarṇa temple.
When Bhagīratha brought Gaṅgā from heaven to the
earth, sea water began to rise and the temples situated
near the sea were submerged. At that time Śuṣka went
along with other Maharṣis to visit Paraśurāma at the
Mahendra mountain. In response to Śuṣka's prayer,
Paraśurāma raised the submerged temples including the
Gokarṇa temple, above the water.
