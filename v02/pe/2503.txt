GRAHAS¦ (PLANETS). Indians from very ancient days
have maintained certain definite ideas and inferences
about the planets. Though those ideas differ somewhat
from the results of modern researches, the influence of
the ancient ideas is discernible in all the Purāṇic texts in
India. The main ideas are summarised below.
<div n="NI"/>Sūrya (Sun), Candra (Moon), Śukra (Venus), Budha
(Mercury), Kuja (Mars), Bṛhaspati (Jupiter), Śani
(Saturn), Rāhu and Ketu are the navagrahas (the nine
planets).

Śukraḥ śanaiścaro rāhuḥ
Ketuśceti navagrahāḥ</Poem>
[Page296-a+ 65]
Besides the above nine planets, Indian astronomers take
into account a starry sphere in the sky called Saptarṣis
and the star called Dhruva.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Sūrya.%} The sun gives light to all the other planets.
It has an area of 50 crore yojanas and its distance from
the earth is 22 crore yojanas. Śūrya exists within the
universe, and is called also Mārtaṇḍa as it originated
from dead (mṛta) egg (aṇḍa). Sūrya divides the sky,
heaven, hell, the earth, east, west, north, south etc.
from one another. According to the course of Sūrya
three periods of time or ‘seasons’ like uttarāyaṇa,
dakṣiṇāyana and viṣuvat are caused. Five months from
May is the uttarāyaṇa period, five months from
November the dakṣiṇāyana period, and the months of
April and October are the Viṣuvats. Since during the
uttarāyaṇa the sun rises up comparatively slowly
(mandagati) during this period the day is longer than
night. As in dakṣiṇāyana the course of the sun is quic-
ker in pace (Śīghragati) night is longer than day, and
during viṣuvat, (samagati) day and night are of equal
duration.
<div n="NI"/>The other planets have three positions called Jaradgava,
Airāvata and Vaiśvānara, the first being the central
position, the second the northern position and the
third the southern position. Nine stars, Aśvinī, Bharaṇī,
Kṛttikā, Rohiṇī, Mṛgaśiras, Ārdrā, Punarvasu and
Puṣya occupy the Airāvata vīthī (northern position
or segment). Another nine stars, Maghā, Pūrva
Phalgunī, Uttara Phalgunī, Hasta, Citrā, Svātī,
Viśakhā, Anurādhā and Jyeṣṭhā occupy the central
position, and the last nine stars, Mūla, Purvāṣāḍha,
Uttarāṣāḍha, Śravaṇa, Śraviṣṭhā, Śatabhiṣak, Pūrva-
proṣṭhapada, Uttaraproṣṭhapada and Revatī occupy the
southern position.
<div n="NI"/>To the east, south, west and north of Mount Mahāmeru
exist Devadhānikā (Indrapurī) Saṃyamanī (Yamapurī)
Ṅimlocanī (Varuṇapurī) and Vibhāvarī (Kuberapurī)
respectively. When Sūrya appears in Devadhānikā it
will be dawn, when he has travelled to Saṃyamanī it
will be noon, when he is in Nimlocanī it will be sunset
and when he is in Vibhāvarī it will be mid-night. This
is how Śurya circles the Mahāmeru. Within 15 nāḍikās
(6 hours) the sun travels 2(1/2) crores plus 2(1/2) lakhs of
yojanas. Sūrya's chariot has one wheel and twelve
spokes. The wheel represents a year and the twelve
spokes stand for the twelve months of the year. The
chariot has also three nābhis representing the three
cāturmāsyas, and six bands representing the six
seasons. The height of the chariot is 36 lakhs yojanas
and it has a width of 8 yojanas inside. Aruṇadeva is the
charioteer, and the seven chandas are the horses. The
seven chandas are, Gāyatrī, Bṛhatī, Uṣṇik, Jagatī,
Triṣṭubh, Anuṣṭubh and Paṅkti).
<div n="NI"/>Night is called Uṣā and day Vyuṣṭi and the time in
between is Sandhyā. When Sandhyā begins the terrible
Rākṣasas called Mandehas attempt to consume Sūrya.
They have been granted the boon that everyday they
will be dying though they may not be losing their
bodies. So, everyday there rages a fierce fight between
them and Sūrya. When the fight is on, noble brahmins
throw up water sanctified by Gāyatrī mantra with
‘Om’. The water turns into Vajrāyudha and burns the
Rākṣasas to ashes. The first offering in Agnihotra is
made with the recitation of the mantra beginning
‘Sūryo Jyoti’ because of which the sun is able to shine
[Page296-b+ 65]
with thousands of rays with the result that the Rākṣasas
are burned to death. The Bālakhilyas who number
more than 60,000 form Sūryā's body-guard. (See under
Sūrya for Purāṇīc stories about him).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Candra. (The Moon).%} Candra exists at one lakh
yojanas away from Sūrya, and it revolves round the
earth. A cāndra month of twentyseven days is divided
into twelve rāśis (houses) viz. Siṃha (Leo), Kanyā
(Virgo) Tulā (Libra) Vṛścika (Scorpio) Dhanus
(Sagittarius) Makara (Capricorn) Kuṃbha (Aquarius)
Mīna (Pisces) Meṣa (Aries) Vṛṣabha (Taurus)
Mithuna (Gemini) and Karkaṭaka (Cancer). Every
month Candra stays in each of the above houses only
for 2(1/4) days.
<div n="NI"/>The full moon makes Pitṛs happy, divides the month
into two halves, Kṛṣṇa Pakṣa (the dark fortnight)
and Śukla Pakṣa (the bright fortnight) and functions
as the very life of all living beings. The twentyseven
stars from Aśvinī to Revatī are the wives of Candra.
There is another view that Candra has twentyeight
wives including another star called Abhijit. Candra has
another name, Sarvamaya. Candra with his pleasing
rays, as sweet as Amṛta (Nectar) bestows happiness on
devas, Pitṛs and all other living beings. So he is called
Sarvamaya.
<div n="NI"/>Candra's chariot has three wheels. Ten beautiful horses
white as Jasmine flowers draw the chariot. These
horses also like those of Sūrya live for a Kalpa era.
Because the Devas drink its digits Candra wanes into
one digit (Kalā). Then Sūrya makes him wax again
with one single ray of his called Suṣumnā. When only
two Kalās of his remain Candra enters the orbit of
Sūrya and stays there in the ray called ‘amā’, and that
day, therefore is called amāvāsyā. And on that day
Candra enters waters for the first time, and after that
dwells in trees, creepers etc. While Candra is thus in
trees etc. those who cut them will be committing the
sin of brahmahatyā. (slaughter of a brahmin). When
only a little of the 15th kalā remains on new moon day
hordes of Pitṛs gather round the enfeebled Candra to
drink him, and they drink the amṛta kalā, one of the
two kalās still remaining with him. Thus the three
classes of Pitṛs, Barhiṣadas, Saumyas and Agniṣvāttas
get absolutely satisfied for one month. Thus Candra
nurtures Devas in the Śukla Pakṣa and pitṛs in Kṛṣṇa
Pakṣa, and grows trees, creepers etc. with life-giving
water. (For details see under Candra).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Śukra (Venus).%} Śukra is an auspicious Deva very
much interested in doing good to the world and making
people happy. His course is also, like that of Śūrya, of
three types, intense (quick), slow and of equal pace.
Two-and-a-half yojanas above Sūrya, Śukra follows a
course alternating in front of and behind Sūrya. Śukra
never goes very far away from Śūrya, and he possesses
a big chariot drawn by horses from earth. (For details
see under Śukra).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Budha (Mercury).%} Though inherently auspicious
Budha, in contact with inauspicious planets takes their
character and becomes weak. Budha also has the three
paces, quick, slow and medium. Budha moves close to
Sūrya and if he moves from Sūrya storms, failure of
rain etc. will be the result. He is considered to be the
son of Candra. His chariot is made of wind and fire,
golden in colour and is drawn by eight horses having
the speed of wind. (See under Budha for more details).
[Page297-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Kuja (Mars).%} Kuja is two lakhs of yojanas above
Budha, and remains in every rāśi (house) more or less
for 45 days. When the position is affected it causes
inauspicious experiences to living beings. The chariot
of Kuja is made of gold, glittering and of huge size.
Eight horses born from Agni draw the chariot.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Bṛhaspati (Jupiter).%} Jupiter travels 2 lakhs of yojanas
away from Kuja's sphere. Though it is an auspicious
planet its reverse course is productive of evil results.
Jupiter travels for twelve months in every rāśi (house).
His golden chariot is drawn by eight white horses. (See
Bṛhaspati).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Śani (Saturn).%} Śani is 2 lakhs of yojanas away from
Jupiter's sphere, and it stays in every house for twenty
months. As it moves only slowly it is called Śanaiścara
also. Śani is considered to be the son of Sūrya. It is an
inauspicious planet. His chariot is drawn by multi-
coloured horses born in the sky.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Rāhu.%} His ash-coloured chariot is drawn by eight
horses as dark as beetles. Once the horses are harness-
ed to the chariot it will always be running. On full
moon days Rāhu starts from Sūrya and reaches Candra
and returns to Sūrya on new moon days. It is an inaus-
picious planet. (For details see under Rāhu).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Ketu.%} His chariot is drawn by eight horses, which
have the speed of wind. It is also an inauspicious
planet.
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Saptarṣis.%} Thirteen crores of yojanas away from the
zone of Śani exists the Saptarṣi zone. Seven maharṣis
are incessantly on the move in that sphere, wishing all
that is well for the whole world. (See Saptarṣis).
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Dhruva.%} Thirteen crores of yojanas away from the
saptarṣimaṇḍala there is a place called Viṣṇupada.
Dhruva, son of Uttānapāda lives there in the company
of Indra, Agni, Kaśyapa, Dharma and others. The
Dhruvamaṇḍala remains there stationary like the
supporting pillar of all the planets ever on the move.
(See Dhruva; Devībhāgavata 8th Skandha; Viṣṇu
Purāṇa, Part II).
<div n="NI"/>Astrologers aver that living beings pass through the
periods and positions of the following planets, viz. Ketu,
Śukra (Venus) Āditya (Sun), Candra (Moon), Kuja
(Mars), Rāhu, Bṛhaspati (Jupiter), Śani (Saturn) and
Budha (Mercury). The following table shows how
people born under different stars pass through the
different daśās. The order of succession of the daśās
and the period of each daśā can also be seen from this
table.
<div n="NI"/>Stars (Day of birth)
<F>1. To find out your daśā at the time of birth, please see the above table. Any one born under any of the stars is considered born
in the daśā shown in the right hand side against that star; e. g. People born under (Aśvayuk) Aśvinī, Mṛgaśīṛṣa and Mūla are born
into the Ketu daśā. So with the other stars also as shown in the above table. To calculate how long the daśā into which a particular person
is born will last requires some astrological skill; also the exact time of birth should be known. A star remains dominant for about 24
hours. If a man is born under a star when half this period of dominance is over, then that man will get only half the period of the corres-
ponding daśā. The portion of the daśā that the man will get is proportionate to the period of dominance of the star. For example,
a man is born under the star Aśvainī (Aśvyuk) when the star is in the last quarter of the Ketu daśā. The total period of this daśā is
7 years. But the man will get only the last quarter of it, namely about 1(3/4) years. After that he will pass on to the next daśā—Śukra-
daśā.</F> <C n="2"/>Daśā <C n="3"/>Years
