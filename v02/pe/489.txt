AŚMAKA I¦. Son born to Vasiṣṭha by the wife of Kalmā-
ṣapāda the King of Ayodhyā. (See Ikṣvāku vaṃśa) while
the King Kalmāṣapāda was walking through the forest
hunting he saw Śakti the son of Vasiṣṭha. As Śakti did not
care to give room for the King, Kalmāṣapāda wounded
Śakti, who cursed the King and changed him to a Rākṣasa
(giant). The giant immediately killed Śakti. After many
years Vasiṣṭha blessed the King and changed the form of
the giant and gave him back his former shape. The King
was delighted at having recovered his former shape. He
took Vasiṣṭha to his palace. Madayantī the wife of the King
with his permission went to Vasiṣṭha and got with child.
Vasiṣṭha returned to the forest. Even after the lapse of a
long period she did not give birth to the child. Madayantī
who was miserable at this, took an ‘aśman’ (a small
cylindrical piece of the granite used to crush things placed
on a flat square piece of granite) and crushed her stomach
with it and she delivered a son. As he was born by using
‘Aśma’ he was named Aśmaka. This King had built a
city called Paudhanyā. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 176).
