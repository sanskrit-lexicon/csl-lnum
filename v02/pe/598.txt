ATHARVĀ I¦. This muni is referred to in Mahābhārata,
Udyoga Parva, Chapter 43, Verse 50, as a professional
chanter of Chandaveda. Once under the curse of Bhṛgu
Maharṣi, Agni hid himself under the sea. (See “AGNI”).
At that time, it was Atharvā who, at the suggestion of
the Devas, went under the water and discovered Agni.
(M.B., Vana Parva, Chapter 222, Verse 8).
<div n="NI"/>Atharvā recovered Agni, and re-created the worlds
which were lying dormant owing to the absence of fire.
(M.B., Vana Parva, Chapter 222, Verse 19).
<div n="NI"/>Atharvā was born from Brahmā's face. His wife was
Śānti, the daughter of Kardama. Citti was another
name for Śānti. But there are some Purāṇas which re-
fer to Citti as another wife of Atharvā. Also, there are
Purāṇas which say that Atharvā was Aṅgiras himself.
