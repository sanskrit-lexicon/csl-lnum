DHĪRADHĪ¦. A brahmin devotee of Śiva. He lived in
Kāśī. Because he meditated on Śiva alone, Śiva was
pleased with him and helped him in various ways.
<div n="NI"/>The gaṇas of Śiva were amazed at Śiva's partiality for
Dhīradhī. Paramaśiva told them the story of the former
birth of Dhīradhī. “This Brahmin was a swan in his
former life. Once he was flying over a lake when he
became tired and fell down. His colour became black.
Then Kamalinī, another swan who dwelt in the same
lake told him to recite the tenth Chapter of Gītā, and
to meditate on Śiva. Because the swan did that holy
act, he was born a Brahmin in his next birth. Though
he was a Brahmin in his previous birth, he kicked his
teacher and for that fault he had to take birth as a
swan. Later, because of the love of Śiva, Dhīradhī
attained heaven. (Padma Purāṇa, Uttara Khaṇḍa,
Chapter 184).
