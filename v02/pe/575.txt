AŚVANADĪ¦. A river in the country of Kuntibhoja.
Aśvanadī joins Carmaṇvatī and the latter joins the
Yamunā and the Yamunā joining Gaṅgā falls into the
ocean. It was through this river that Kuntīdevī floated
in a box the infant Karṇa. At night accompanied by
her maid, Kunti floated the box containing her illegiti-
mate son and stood on the banks of Aśvanadī weeping
bitterly. Then thinking that her father would notice
her absence from the palace she returned home soon.
The box floated and reached the country, Campāpurī,
ruled by a charioteer. (Ślokas 22 to 26, Chapter 308,
Araṇya Parva, M.B.).
