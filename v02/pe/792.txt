ĀSURI¦. An ancient Maharṣi. He was the ācārya of
Kapila Sāṃkhyadarśana and the guru of the maharṣi
Pañcaśikha. Once Āsuri had a full vision of God. He
gave many precepts on spiritual matters to other
Maharṣis. The Bhāgavata says that Āsuri received his
spiritual enlightenment from his wife, Kapilā. (M.B.,
