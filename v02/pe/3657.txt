KṚŚĀŚVA I¦. The Prajāpati called Kṛśāśva married
Jayā and Suprabhā the daughters of Dakṣaprajāpati
and to both were born fifty sons each. All the sons were
really arrows called Saṃhāra. Viśvāmitra, by the power
of penance made these hundred sons (arrows) of Kṛśā-
śva his own. It was these arrows, which Viśvāmitra
gave to Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
Bālakāṇḍa, Cantos 21 and 26).
