MAINĀKA I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} A mountain. This mountain was
the son of Himavān and father of Krauñca. (Śloka 13,
Chapter 18, Harivaṃśa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How the mountain helped Hanūmān.%} There is an
unbreakable tie between Maināka and the Kings of
Ikṣvāku family. There is a story in Brahmāṇḍa
Purāṇa that the sāgara (ocean) was constructed by the
sixty thousand sons of the King Sagara of Ikṣvāku
family. This sāgara once gave refuge to Maināka and
brought it up. There is a reason for that:—
[Page468-b+ 64]
In the early yugas mountains had wings and they used
to fly and drop to the ground as they liked. People
used to live in fright always and at the request of the
people Indra made the mountains stand in a row and
cut off their wings. At that time the god Vāyu (wind)
took away his friend Maināka and put him in the
ocean. From that day onwards Maināka and the
ocean developed an intimacy which even death could
not wipe off. Hanūmān was the son of Vāyu, the
friend and saviour of Maināka. It was because of that
that Maināka gave refuge for Hanūmān on his way to
Laṅkā. Because the ocean gave refuge to Maināka
after its escape from the sword of Indra and because
the ocean (Sāgara) was the creation of the sons of
Sagara, a King of the Ikṣvāku race, Maināka felt
indebted to Sagara and the entire race to which he
belonged. Maināka thus had great respect for Śrī
Rāma who belonged to the Ikṣvāku race. This was
also responsible for Maināka giving relief to Hanūmān
on his way to Laṅkā. (See under Parvata).
