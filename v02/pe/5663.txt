RĀMEŚVARA¦. There is in South India a very famous
holy place called Rāmeśvara and a Śiva temple there.
Rāma and others encamped on the sea shore to cross
over to Laṅkā to release Sītā from Rāvaṇa's custody.
This temple, according to Kamba, was built by Rāma at
that time. The following story is from the Yuddha Kāṇḍa
of Kamba Rāmāyaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>To make the passage over to Laṅkā easy, Rāma decided to
build a great temple at Rāmeśvara and install a Śivaliṅga
in the temple. Under the expert supervision of the great
architects, Nala and Nīla, all the monkeys cooperated to
build the temple. As ordered by Rāma, Hanūmān went to
Kailāsa to fetch Śivaliṅga. Hanūmān did not return
with the liṅga though the auspicious time for the ins-
tallation was very near. How could the installation be
[Page642-b+ 65]
made without the idol and the installation had to be
made at the appointed time.
<div n="NI"/>Śrī Rāma stood ready near the installation platform.
It was the exact time for the installation of the idol.
A divine effulgence was seen to emerge from Rāma and
immediately a Śivaliṅga automatically appeared at the
spot where rituals were conducted for installation.
Everyone was wonder-struck by this mysterious hap-
pening.
<div n="NI"/>Hanūmān by now, returned with the liṅga and he felt
sorry that the installation of the idol had already been
made. Śrī Rāma told him: “Please remove the idol
already installed, we shall install a new one.”
<div n="NI"/>Happy at the words of Rāma, Hanūmān entwined the
idol with his tail and jumped directly upwards. But,
his tail was cut, head clashed against the roof which
was broken and Hanūmān fell down unconscious. Śrī
Rāma held him up and patted him on the head and
Hanūmān was more pleased than ever. Afterwards, to
fulfil Hanūmān's desire and for the prosperity of the
temple Hanūmān was made to install the new
Śivaliṅga in front of the eastern tower of the temple.
Śrī Rāma laid down the following rule also. Only after
worshipping the idol at the tower, should the God in-
side the temple be worshipped.
<div n="NI"/>The rule was also recorded there.
