BHADRĀŚVA I¦. A king of Pūruvaṃśa. He was the son
of Rahovādi. Bhadrāśvā had ten sons: Ṛkṣeyu, Kṛṣeyu,
Sannateyu, Ghṛteyu, Citeyu, Sthaṇḍileyu, Dharmeyu,
Sammiteyu, Kṛteyu and Matināra. (Chapter 278, Agni
Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>Once Agastya went and stayed for seven days in the
palace of Bhadrāśva and his wife Kāntimatī. Every-
day Agastya used to speak in glowing terms about
Kāntimatī and asked about the reason for it he replied:
“In her previous birth Kāntimatī was a servant girl in
a wealthy house. The master of the house once entrust-
ed her with the task of seeing that none of the temple
lights went out on the night of Dvādaśī in the month
of Tulā (Āśvina—October). She did her duty so
willingly and sincerely that she was born as a queen and
you a King”. Then Agastya gave them instructions
about that Vrata which both Bhadrāśva and Kāntimatī
observed sincerely, receiving as a result benediction
from Viṣṇu. (Vāyu Purāṇa).
