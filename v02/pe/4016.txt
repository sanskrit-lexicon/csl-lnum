LOKĀLOKA¦. There is a mountain between Loka and
Aloka. This is called Lokālokaparvata and the land
beside it is called Lokāloka. The mountain is as long
as the distance between Mānasottara and Mahāmeru.
This place is golden in colour and as smooth as glass.
Not a single being lives there. God has created this as
a boundary to the three worlds. All the planets like
the Sun get light from the brilliance of this mountain.
Brahmā has posted four diggajas named Vṛṣabha,
Puṣpacūḍa, Vāmana and Aparājita in the four corners
of this mountain. (8th Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
