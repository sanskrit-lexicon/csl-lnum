TURVASU¦. A son born to Yayāti of his wife Devayānī.
Yayāti had two wives Śarmiṣṭhā and Devayānī. Of
Śarmiṣṭhā, Yayātī had three sons named Druhyu,
Anudruhyu and Pūru and of Devayānī, two sons named
Yadu and Turvasu.
<div n="NI"/>Once Yayāti called all his five sons to his side and ask-
ed them if any one of them would be willing to ex-
change his youth with his father's old age. All the four
refused but Pūru agreed to accede to his father's request.
Yayāti then cursed Turvasu and all the other three.
