MANYU I¦. A Vedic god. The origin of this god is des-
cribed in Brahma Purāna as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Once a terrible war broke out between Devas and
Asuras. The Devas who were defeated, went to the
Gautamī river valley and performed penance to Śiva
praying for victory. Śiva produced Manyu from his
third eye and presented him to the Devas. In the
battle which followed they defeated the Asuras with the
help of Manyu.
