KṚTA¦. I. A King of Janaka's dynasty. He was the son
of Vijaya and father of Śunaka. (Bhāgavata, 9th
Skandha). Kṛta had seven beautiful daughters who,
because of a sense of non-attachment and renunciation,
forsook their father's home for the cremation ground
even while they were mere children. They lay down
there declaring that they had left their bodies as food
for the birds; and birds and wild beasts ate up their
beautiful bodies. Because of this life of renunciation,
they attained salvation. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Madana-
mañjukālambaka, Taraṅga 2).
