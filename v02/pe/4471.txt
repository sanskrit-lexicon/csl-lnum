MAYA¦. A Dānava king who served Devas and Asuras
as their architect and builder.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Kaśyapa Prajāpati, son of Marīci and
grandson of Brahmā married the thirteen daughters of
Dakṣa. Among them, the first was Aditi, the second
was Diti and the third was Danu. Āditeyas were born
to Aditi, Daityas were born to Diti and Dānavas were
born to Danu. The chief among the sons of Danu
was Maya.
<div n="NI"/>Maya was found to be very proficient in the art of archi-
tecture even from his boyhood. He worshipped Brahmā
in the Himālayas to gain unrivalled skill in architecture
Brahmā was pleased and appeared before him. He
blessed Maya to become the unequalled architect of the
Devas. Asuras and Dānavas. After that Maya was en-
gaged in building magnificent mansions for Devas and
Asuras. He was also anointed King of the Dānavas.
<div n="NI"/>It was a period of friendly co-operation and brotherly
relations between Devas and Asuras. Once there was a
dancing show in Devaloka. Maya was also invited to
see the performance of the women of Devaloka. All the
dancers acquitted themselves creditably. But what
attracted Maya most, was the dance of Hemā, the
Apsarā woman. Maya and Hemā were mutually
attracted and fell in love with each other. The Devas
who came to know of this, gave Hemā in marriage to
Maya. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Domestic life.%} Maya and Hemā went to the valley
south of Himavān and built there a city named “Hema-
pura”. While leading a happy life there, two sons,
Māyāvī and Dundubhi were born to them. But they had
no daughter. So they worshipped Śiva, praying for a
daughter.
<div n="NI"/>At about that time, one day, an Apsarā woman,
Madhurā, after observing Somavāra Vrata, came to
Śiva and did obeisance to him. Pārvatī was not at home
at the moment. Fascinated by Madhurā's charm, Śiva
embraced her. Pārvatī who came to know of it, cursed
[Page495-a+ 65]
Madhurā and turned her into a frog. But she said that
after twelve years, the curse would be lifted and she
would become a woman again. It was in a well near
the place where Maya and Hemā were performing tapas
that Madhurā fell as frog. After twelve years, the frog
recovered her former shape as a woman. At that time
Maya saw her, and taking her to be the daughter
given to him by Śiva, took her with him to his palace.
He gave her the name “Mandodarī”. It was this
“Mandodarī” whom Rāvaṇa married later.
<div n="NI"/>Besides these three children, Maya had some other
sons and daughters. In Devī Bhāgavata, 8th Skandha
there is a reference to the Dānava named Bala, the son
of Maya, living in Atala, a section of Pātāla. In Kathā
saritsāgara, Madanamañcukālambaka, 3rd Taraṅga we
find that Maya had two daughters named Svayam-
prabhā and Somaprabhā. Of them, Somaprabhā was
married by Nalakūbara, the son of Vaiśravaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Alliance with Arjuna and construction of Indraprastha.%}
Once Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna offered Khāṇḍavavana to Agni-
deva as a feast. (See under the word “Khāṇḍavadāha”).
While Agni was furiously feeding upon the forests, the
human and animal inhabitants in it began to flee from
it. Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna shot them down with arrows. At
that time Maya was hiding himself in the disguise of
Takṣaka. When the flames of fire approached that place
Maya left his shelter and rushed out. Śrī Kṛṣṇa aimed
his weapon Cakra at him. Crying aloud with fear,
Maya ran to Arjuna praying for protection. Arjuna
stopped Agnideva and Śrī Kṛṣṇa and thus saved Maya.
(M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 240).
<div n="NI"/>From that time, Maya became a loyal follower of
Arjuna. After Khāṇḍavadāha, Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna were
taking rest when Maya approached them with joined
palms and asked Arjuna what he should do in return
for saving him from the fury of Kṛṣṇa and the blazing
fire. Arjuna replied that he expected no return from
Maya for saving his life but wanted only his friend-
ship. Maya was not satisfied. He insisted that Arjuna
should accept some service from him as a token of his
deep gratitude. On hearing this, Śrī Kṛṣṇa suggested
that Maya should build a beautiful palace for
the Pāṇḍavas. Accordingly he built a magnificent
palace for the Pāṇḍavas at the place called Khāṇḍava-
prastha. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 1).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Maya settled down in Vindhya.%} Once Maya sought
shelter from Mahāviṣṇu. Viṣṇu offered shelter to Maya
and so he built a mansion called “Sudharmā” for all
the Devas. It was a building of inexpressible beauty and
rare architectural workmanship. The Asuras who
became angry with Maya for his alliance with the Devas
made preparations to attack him. Alarmed at it, Maya
fled southwards with his family and reached Vindhya.
There he built a lovely mansion and settled down in it.
(Kathāśaritsāgara, Madanamañcukālambaka, 3rd
Taraṅga).
<div n="NI"/>In Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Kiṣkindhā kāṇḍa, 50th sarga
also there is a reference to this wonderful mansion
which Maya built on the Vindhya mountain. In their
search for Sītā, Hanūmān and the other monkeys
reached the Vindhya mountain. There they combed the
forests and caves to find out Sītā. When they caṃe to
the peak to the south west of the mountain, they saw a
huge dark cave. They entered it and cautiously moved
forward. After a long and tedious walk the monkeys
[Page495-b+ 64]
were exhausted with hunger and thirst. When they
proceeded a little further, they came across a bright
place. There they saw a woman sitting alone, dressed
in deer skin and barks of trees. She greeted them and
in the course of her talk with the monkeys she told
them that the cave was made by the magician Maya
and that her name was Svayamprabhā. Her mother was
Merusāvarṇī and that she (Svayamprabhā) was entrust-
ed with the task guarding the wonderful mansion.
Then she gave them fruits and fresh water.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Building of Tripuras.%} It was Maya who built three
magic dwellings for the three Dānavas, Kamalākṣa,
Tārakākṣa and Vidyunmālī. (For details see under the
word Pura).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 227, Verse 41
says that Namuci the Dānava was the brother of Maya.
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Maya had two sons named Sunītha and Sudaṇḍika
They became human beings under a curse. (For details
see under the word Sūryaprabhā).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) In Kathāsaritsāgara Madanamañcukālambaka,
8th Taraṅga we see that Maya was an incarnation of
Viśvakarmā.
<div n="NI"/>(iv) At the time when Mahāviṣṇu as Vāmana took the
three worlds from Mahābali, Maya joined with other
Dānavas and fought against Vāmana. (M.B. Bhaviṣya
Parva, Chapter 55).
<div n="NI"/>(v) Once Maya was relaxing with his friends on the
Malaya mountain. Knowing about it Maheśvara sent
Indra to that mountain. Indra challenged the Dānavas
for a fight. In the battle that followed, Indra killed the
Dānava named Pāka. Thus he got the name, “Pāka-
śāsana”. Indra killed Pura, the son of Mahābali also in
that battle and so came to be known as “Purandara”
The remaining Dānavas under the leadership of Maya
fled to Pātāla. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 71).
