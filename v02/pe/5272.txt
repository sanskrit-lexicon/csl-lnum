PRAHLĀDA I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Son of a rākṣasa King who
saw Mahāviṣṇu by means of his devotion in the form
of Narasiṃha (man-lion). His father was Hiraṇya-
kaśipu and mother Kayādhū.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Viṣṇu—
Brahmā—Marīci—Kaśyapa—Hiraṇyakaśipu—
Prahlāda.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Birth.%} Kaśyapaprajāpati got of his wife Diti two
sons named Hiraṇyākṣa and Hiraṇyakaśipu and a
daughter named Siṃhikā. Of these two, Hiraṇyākṣa got
boons from Brahmā and roamed about as a very valiant
hero destroying everything on earth and finally pulling
down the earth to the depths of the ocean. Mahāviṣṇu
then incarnated as Varāha and after killing Hiraṇyā-
kṣa lifted the earth from the ocean and put it in its
original position.
<div n="NI"/>Hiraṇyakaśipu became very angry at Mahāviṣṇu for
killing his brother and with a view to wreaking
vengeance on him performed penance to propitiate
Brahmā. When the emperor of the demons, Hiraṇya-
kaśipu, thus went to the forests for performing penance
the Devas attacked the land of the demons. A great
fight ensued in which the devas were defeated. While
fleeing away thus Indra took away Kayādhū wife of
Hiraṇyakaśipu by force. Nārada who heard the
moanings of the poor woman under the clutches of
Indra got her released from Indra's hold. For some
time she stayed in the āśrama of Nārada worshipping
him. Kayādhū was pregnant then. Nārada taught the
child in Kayādhū's womb lessons in Vedas, moral
philosophy, duty and spiritual knowledge. When
Hiraṇyakaśipu returned after his penance Kayādhū
joined him and very soon gave birth to a son. That boy
was Prahlāda.
<div n="NI"/>Hiraṇyakaśipu begot of Kayādhū five sons, Prahlāda,
Saṃhlāda, Anuhlāda, Śibi and Bāṣkala. Prahlāda got
three sons named Virocana, Kumbha and Nikumbha.
The celebrated emperor Mahābali was the son of
Virocana. Bāṇa was the son of Mahābali. Uṣā,
daughter of Bāṇa, was married to Aniruddha, son of
Pradyumna and grandson of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. (Chapter 65,
Ādi Parva; Chapter 19, Agni Purāṇa; Chapter 15,
Aṃśa 1, Viṣṇu Purāṇa and 7th Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Boyhood and education.%} Hiraṇyakaśipu decided to
make Prahlāda an instrument to wreak vengeance on
Mahāviṣṇu. Entrusting the education of his son to
[Page596-a+ 65]
able preceptors he instructed that the boy should never
mutter ‘Nārāyaṇāya namaḥ’ but should on the other
hand mutter ‘Hiraṇyāya namaḥ’ only. Not only that,
he wiped out the name of Nārāyaṇa from the land
altogether. Prahlāda stayed in the house of the
preceptor and studied his lessons. One day Prahlāda
went to see his father along with his preceptor. Hiraṇya-
kaśipu was drunk then. Prahlāda went and prostrated
before his father and Hiraṇyakaśipu lifting the boy up
from the ground asked him with affection to repeat to
him all the good things he had learned so far and
Prahlāda quickly repeated thus:—“I bow down to
Mahāviṣṇu, the root cause of all things seen and unseen,
the protector of this visible universe, who is without
beginning, centre and end and who is without origin,
growth and decay.”
<div n="NI"/>The words of Prahlāda struck his father like a thunder-
bolt. With his lips trembling with anger Hiraṇyakaśipu
stared with his blood-red eyes at the preceptor. The
frightened Guru again and again submitted that he had
never taught him any of the kind the boy had repeated
before his father. Then who must have taught him those
things? the emperor enquired. Then Prahlāda said
that all those things were put into his mind by Mahā-
viṣṇu himself. A hot discussion then took place between
Prahlāda and his father and in the end Hiraṇyakaśīpu
ordered the preceptor to take away Prahlāda and make
another earnest attempt to correct him and bring him
round to the emperor's liking. Prahlāda stayed for ano-
ther period with the Guru serving him with devotion
and studying well. After a long time Prahlāda was
again taken before his father and the latter as before
asked him to repeat what he had studied so far. To the
shocking disappointment of Hiraṇyakaśipu Prahlāda
again repeated verses in praise of Mahāviṣṇu. The emp-
eror's rage knew no bounds and he ordered his men to
kill his son. (Chapter 17, Aṃśa 1, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Torturing Prahlāda.%} On hearing the order of Hiraṇya-
kaśipu many armed soldiers surrounded Prahlāda.
Prahlāda addressed them thus: “Oh daityas, Mahā-
viṣṇu resides in your weapons, in you all and in me also.
Since that is the real truth your weapons will not in-
jure me.” The daityas struck him hard with their wea-
pons but Prahlāda did not feel pain at all.
<div n="NI"/>Hiraṇyakaśipu then sent thousands of poisonous ser-
pents led by great ones like Takṣaka. When they started
thrusting their venomous fangs into his body, Prahlāda
stood cheerfully meditating on Mahāviṣṇu and he did
not even feel the bitings. On the other hand the fangs
of the serpents dropped out from their mouths and the
gems on the heads of the big ones burst out and all the
snakes felt sorry for their action.
<div n="NI"/>Hiraṇyakaśipu then sent the aṣṭadiggajas (the eight
elephants who bear the burden of this earth) to kill
Prahlāda. The huge animals bigger than the biggest of
mountains threw the boy to the ground and struck him
with their long and pointed tusks. Prahlāda lay medi-
tating on Mahāviṣṇu and the tusks that hit the body of
Prahlāda were broken to bits. Prahlāda was then
thrown into a pit of fire. But the wind-blown ferocious
fire was not able to burn him and as he lay in the fire-
pit meditating on Mahāviṣṇu he felt he was lying on a
bed of lotuses.
<div n="NI"/>When things progressed so far the astonished priests of
the palace advised the emperor to put a stop to tortur-
[Page596-b+ 65]
ing Prahlāda. Their consoling words alleviated his rage
and he sent Prahlāda again to his Guru for another
term of study. He stayed with his Guru and continued
his studies. Whenever he got leisure he taught the other
inmates of the āśrama lessons in Viṣṇumārga. Hiraṇya-
kaśipu was informed of this and obeying orders from him
the asuras gave poison to Prahlāda. That too was of no
avail. The royal priests got angry and they created a
devil as ferocious as the flames of fire. The devil with
mighty thumpings on earth dashed towards Prahlāda
and hit him on his breast with its spike. The spike
broke into pieces and the devil turning back cursed the
priests. Then the daityarāja took him to the top of a
mountain twentyfour miles high and pushed him down
from there. The boy fell down meditating on Mahā-
viṣṇu and the goddess of earth received him with ex-
tended hands and prevented a painful impact with the
ground. The father became furious and sent Śambarā-
sura to kill his son. Śambara tried many magical attacks.
Prahlāda without any ill-feeling towards Śambara
sat meditating on Mahāviṣṇu and then Viṣṇu sent his
Sudarśana wheel against the demon and he was forced
to retreat. Then by orders from Hiraṇyakaśipu the wind
god entered the body of Prahlāda. Prahlāda knew it
and he sat meditating on Viṣṇu and the latter entering
the body of Prahlāda drank the wind inside him. When
Hiraṇyakaśipu was defeated in all his attempts to kill
Prahlāda he sent his son again to his Guru. Then the
preceptor taught him everything that was needed for a
king and also the science of justice written by Śukrā-
cārya. When Prahlāda completed his education and the
Guru felt the boy had become humble he took him back
to Hiraṇyakaśipu.
<div n="NI"/>Once again Hiraṇyakaśipu entered into a discussion on
god with his son and dissatisfied with his continued de-
votion to Viṣṇu decided again to kill his son. He was
thrown into the ocean bound hand and foot. With every
movement of Prahlāda the ocean became turbulent
and water rose on all sides. There was a deluge on
earth. Hiraṇyakaśipu called the daityas to his side and
said: “Oh daityas, bring all the mountains on earth
and create a barrier round the ocean so that my wicked
son cannot get outside the ocean. Fire does not kill
this boy; he is not wounded by any of the weapons;
wind, poison, devils, magic, falls from heights and even
the diggajas could not kill him. So let him remain in
water for thousands of years together and then he
will die.”
<div n="NI"/>The daityas and dānavas brought mountains and drop-
ped them over Prahlāda lying inside the ocean. The
mountains lay spread over thousands of miles. Lying
thus in the ocean the pious boy prayed to Mahāviṣṇu
and the latter appeared before him and granted him
boons. Escaping from the ocean Prahlāda went to his
father and prostrated before him. Hiraṇyakaśipu was
astounded to see him alive and taking him in his arms
embraced him and with tears rolling down his cheeks
for having tortured him so far asked him “My son, you
are still alive, are you not?” After that he started treat-
ing him as his son. (Chapter 20, Aṃśa 1, Viṣṇu
Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%The incarnation of Narasiṃha.%} But as days went by
Hiraṇyakaśipu got wild again. He could not bear his
son's increasing devotion to Viṣṇu. He hated to hear
Prahlāda's chantings of Viṣṇu's name and so one dar
[Page597-a+ 65]
while Prahlāda was repeating his chantings of Viṣṇu's
name Hiraṇyakaśipu jumped up from his seat with
sword in his hand and asked Prahlāda where his Viṣṇu
was. Prahlāda very calmly replied that Viṣṇu was pre-
sent everywhere even in stones, trees or the pillars of
the palace. Hiraṇyakaśipu in uncontrollable rage struck
the nearest pillar with his sword. Then to the shock-
ing surprise of Hiraṇyakaśipu Mahāviṣṇu in the form of
a fierce man-lion (Narasiṃha) jumped out from the
pillar. The figure was terrifying to look at. It had fiery
eyes, a dagger-like tongue with blood oozing from it,
shaggy neck with trembling eyebrows, two teeth one
on each side curved like the crescent moon, a black face
inside a cave-like heap of manes, hairs strong and point-
ed like diamond needles, nails white and cup-like and
a body as bright and brilliant as a thousand crores of
suns. Only Prahlāda could stand before the figure and
look at it.
<div n="NI"/>The man-lion jumped on the body of Hiraṇyakaśipu
and tearing open the belly of Hiraṇyakaśipu took the
bloody intestines out and wearing it round its neck
performed a naked dance. Everything happened in no
time and the Narasiṃha changing into the form of
Mahāviṣṇu blessed Prahlāda and then disappeared.
(7th Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Prahlāda and Naranārāyaṇas.%} When Hiraṇyakaśipu
was killed Prahlāda was crowned as emperor of the
demons in Pātāla. At that time, once Cyavana the best of
the Bhṛgus, went to Nāgakuleśvaratīrtha to bathe in the
Narmadā. He saw Mahādeva there. When he entered
the waters of the river a serpent Kekaralohita by name
bit him and took him to Pātāla. Cyavana meditated on
Viṣṇu when he was bitten by the serpent and so he was
not affected by the poison of the serpent. He therefore,
roamed about in Pātāla accepting the hospitality of the
serpent maidens. Travelling thus he reached the land
of the dānavas. He was worshipped by the daityas there
and Prahlāda finding an ascetic of great saintliness hon-
oured and worshipped by his people received him with
respect and worshipped him and enquired about him.
Cyavana said: “I came today to see Nāgakuleśvara
and bathe in the Narmadā river. But as soon as I en-
tered the river I was caught by a serpent and was
brought to Pātāla. I was thus able to see you.” Hearing
the words of Cyavana the lord of the daityas said: “Oh,
Bhagavan, which are all the sacred tīrthas of the earth,
which are in the heavens and which all in Pātāla?
Please do enlighten us.” Cyavana replied; “Mighty
king, Naimiṣa is the best of all tīrthas on earth, Puṣkara
in the heavens and Cakratīrtha in Pātāla.”
<div n="NI"/>The daitya emperor turned to the dānavas and said
“Make all preparations immediately. We must go to
earth to bathe in the holy tīrtha, Naimiṣa. We can then
see Puṇḍarīkākṣa (lotus-eyed) Viṣṇu sitting there as
Pītāmbara (robed in yellow).” Hearing this dānavas
with heavy equipments started from Pātāla with their
king to the earth.
<div n="NI"/>All the mighty dānavas reached the forest of Naimiṣa
and after bathing in the holy pond there went for hunt-
ing. During their wanderings they found the river Sar-
asvatī, flowing with crystal-like water. On the shore of
the same they saw a pine tree covered with arrows. The
arrows were sticking to it one above another. The arr-
ows looked like serpents and the gruesome sight roused
Prahlāda's anger. Near that tree sat two ascetics wear-
[Page597-b+ 65]
ing the hide of Kṛṣṇa deer and matted hair on their
heads. By their side were two divine bows, Śārṅga and
Ajagava with two never-empty quivers. Prahlāda mis-
took them for two fake sannyāsins and therefore question-
ed them thus: “Why are you thus falsely trading on
virtuousness? What connection is there between matted
hair and penance and weapons of such supreme qual-
ity?” Then one of the ṛṣis, Nararṣi, said “King of dait-
yas, why do you think like that? If one is powerful
whatever one does will be right.” Prahlāda jeered and said
“When I, who have fixed limits for virtue and righte-
ousness, am here what power can you wield?” Nara
replied “Oh king, our ability is really supreme. There
is nobody in the three worlds to conquer us in a fight.”
Prahlāda got furious on hearing the boasting of the ṛṣi
and took a vow thus immediately: “I will fight and
win against Naranārāyaṇas.” Then the great Prah-
lāda keeping aside his army in the forest took his bow
and made a thundering noise with it.
<div n="NI"/>At once Nara took his Ajagava bow and showered arr-
ows on Prahlāda with it. But Prahlāda broke them all
with his gold-plated matchless arrows. Nara got angry
when he found all his arrows broken to pieces so easily
by Prahlāda and he sent different kinds of arrows in
quick succession. But the daitya king replied with aston-
ishing rapidity. For one arrow of Nara the daitya sent
two and the fight became grim. Nara covered the whole
world above with arrows and the daitya emperor smash-
ed them all to pieces by his gold-plated ones.
<div n="NI"/>The fight then turned to one with divine weapons. The
asura chief took the divine Brahmāstra and then Nara
took the fierce Nārāyaṇāstra. They met in the air and
fell down powerless. When his Brahmāstra got fused
Prahlāda got wild with anger and taking a mace jump-
ed out of his chariot and rushed at Nara. When Nārā-
yaṇa saw the daitya chief rushing towards Nara with
his mace he asked Nara to step aside and faced the
demon himself. Prahlāda then attacked Nārāyaṇa and
hit him with the mace. But the mace broke into a hun-
dred pieces and Prahlāda was forced to use other wea-
pons. The fight became ghastly and even devas assem-
bled above to witness the fight. When Prahlāda found
it was getting more and more difficult for him to defeat
the Naranārāyaṇas he prayed to Mahāviṣṇu for help.
Viṣṇu appeared before him and when Prahlāda asked
him the reason why he could not defeat Naranārāyaṇas,
Viṣṇu replied that they were the sons of Dharmadeva
who were invincible by weapons. They could be won
over only by devotion.
<div n="NI"/>Hearing that Prahlāda returned to Pātāla and entrust-
ing the administration of his kingdom to his cousin
Andhaka, son of Hiraṇyākṣa, Prahlāda returned to
Badarikāśrama and erecting an āśrama there started a
penance to propitiate Naranārāyaṇas. When Nara-
nārāyaṇas appeared before him Prahlāda requested to
be pardoned for fighting against them. They pardoned
him and blessed him and Prahlāda returned to Pātāla.
Even after his return Prahlāda did not take back the
administration from Andhaka. He constructed an
āśrama away from the palace and lived there performing
penance. He spent many years there as an advisor
to the asura Kings. (Chapters 7 and 8, Vāmana
Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Blessings of Śukra.%} Andhaka, son of Hiraṇyākṣa,
ruled over the empire only for a short time. At that time
[Page598-a+ 65]
there was a fight between the asuras and the devas in
which the asuras were defeated. After a truce with the
devas Bali, son of Virocana, and grandson of Prahlāda
was crowned the emperor of the asuras. Prahlāda then
went to the mountain Gandhamādana and started doing
penance to increase his personal power. Bali ruled as
an antagonist of the devas and so very soon a grisly
battle ensued between the devas and the asuras
and Mahāviṣṇu defeated them. They fled from their
land and took refuge under their preceptor Śukrācārya.
Śukra then told them thus: “You remain here without
fear. I shall protect you by my power of mantra and
medicines. I shall devote my cogent brilliance to your
advantage. It is enough if you remain here with full con-
fidence in me.”
<div n="NI"/>The devas understood all these plans of the daityas
through spies and they met in conference to consider
their future plans. They knew that Śukrācārya was very
powerful and if the daityas attacked them with the
help of Śukrācārya the defeat of the devas was sure.
They feared that they might even be compelled to flee
from Svargaloka. How could the daityas under the
shield of the mighty Sukra be destroyed? That was the
worrying thought of the devas.
<div n="NI"/>They were thus worrying about this when Śukrācārya
went to do penance for attaining more power. The
daityas awaited the return of their ācārya. In the mean-
time they sent Prahlāda who was, though a daitya, a
friend of the devas to talk peace terms with the devas.
The mission was successful and the devas agreed to a
no-war treaty. Prahlāda returned triumphant.
<div n="NI"/>Śukra did severe penance to propitiate Śiva and Śiva
appeared before Śukrācārya and when he knew that
the purpose of Śukra was to defeat the devas he was
a bit embarrassed. So he told him thus: “Oh sage
Śukra, you take a vow and do penance with your head
downwards over smoky incense for a thousand years.
You will then attain power and happiness as you
desire.” In fact Śiva thought Śukra might not be able
to complete the penance and so not succeed in his plan
of destroying the devas. But Śukra started the penance
in right earnest.
<div n="NI"/>The devas were frightened when they knew the deceit
of the daityas and the strategy of their preceptor. They
decided to go to war with the daityas immediately. The
daityas were in a fix. They knew that if they fought
without the help of their guru defeat to them was sure.
So they ran to the mother of Śukra and sought her help.
The devas rebelled against Śukra's mother and she in-
voked the goddess of sleep and put all the devas into
deep slumber. Mahāviṣṇu stealthily carried away Indra
lying asleep. Indra persuaded Mahāviṣṇu. to kill Śukra's
mother and he cut off the head of Śukra's mother by
the divine discus, Sudarśana.
<div n="NI"/>Bhṛgumaharṣi, father of Śukra, was angry at that
arrogant and cruel deed of Mahāviṣṇu and cursed him
saying that he would be born on earth several times as
man. After that he brought to life by sprinkling water
his wife lying dead with her head severed from her body.
Knowing well the havoc that would be created
when Śukra came back after his penance Indra
sent his daughter Jayantī to destroy the penance of
Śukra. She went in the guise of a demon girl to serve
Śukrācārya. In the meantime at the request of Indra
Bṛhaspati took the form of Śukrācārya and presented
[Page598-b+ 64]
himself before the daityas. The daityas believed him to
be their real guru Śukra and were pleased.
<div n="NI"/>Ten years went by and one day Śukrācārya remember-
ing the old events left Jayantī and went to his court
in the demon land. Bṛhaspati had by that time returned
to devaloka fully satisfied with his mission. The devas
not knowing that Śukra had returned started for a war
with the daityas. Śukra when he came back went wild
when he knew that his people had been worshipping
Bṛhaspati for ten years. The angered preceptor was not
to be pacified by any amount of arguments and so they
sent Prahlāda to Śukrācārya and Prahlāda pleaded for
controlling his anger and Śukra did so.
<div n="NI"/>Śukra then saw with his divine vision the maneuverings
in mind of the devas and was convinced that a war with
the devas at that juncture would be an utter failure. So
he advised the daityas to desist from war and assured
them that during the period of Sāvarṇi Manu to come,
emperor Bali would become all-powerful and he would
then fight and win the devas. Prahlāda returned and
told the asuras the message of Śukrācārya. But the
daityas were not satisfied and compelled Prahlāda to go
to war with the devas. At last Prahlāda was forced
to agree and a fierce devāsura battle ensued. Prah-
lāda met Indra in a single combat and it prolonged for
a hundred years. In the end Prahlāda won. Indra
prayed to the goddess and fearing that she might des-
troy the demon world, Prahlāda also prayed to her.
The devī was pleased with both of them and she paci-
fied them both and each went back to his own place.
