NIKṢUBHĀ¦. An Apsarā woman about whom the follow-
ing story occurs in the Brahmaparva of the Bhaviṣya
Purāṇa. On account of the curse of Sūrya, Nikṣubhā, the
great beauty in Svarloka, was born on earth as daughter
of Sujihva a brahmin of Mihira Gotra. At the instance
of her father, she used to keep the yajña fire ever
burning. One day the fire held in her hands abruptly
burst into flames, and her unique beauty revealed in
the light kindled the passion of Sūrya.
<div n="NI"/>Next day Sūrya went to Sujihva and told him that his
[Page538-a+ 65]
daughter, Nikṣubhā was carrying since he had married
her. As soon as he heard Sūrya's words Sujihva cursed
his daughter thus: “Since the child in your womb is
enveloped by fire the child born to you will be despised
and rejected by people.”
<div n="NI"/>Then Sūrya went to Nikṣubhā and told her that though
her child might be despised he would be a scholar, very
well-bred and eligible for the worship of Agni.
<div n="NI"/>As years passed many children were born to her by Sūrya.
While she was living in the Śāka island Sāmba, the son
of Kṛṣṇa, deputed her sons to perform rites in the Sūrya
temple at Sāmbapura. Nikṣubhā's sons were married to
girls born in the Bhoja family.
