DEVAVRATA II¦. A brahmin who believed in yajñas.
He once received without due regard and with indif-
ference the tīrtha water given to him by a devotee of
Kṛṣṇa after worship of the Lord, as a result of which,
in the next birth, he was born as a bamboo stem. And,
as he did, consciously or otherwise some good deeds Śrī
Kṛṣṇa made a flute out of that bamboo stem, and
Devavrata thus attained redemption. (Padma Purāṇa,
Pātāla Khaṇḍa, Chapter 73).
