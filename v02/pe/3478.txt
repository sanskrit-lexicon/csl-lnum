KEŚINĪ V¦. Once there arose a quarrel between Sudh-
anvā, the son of Aṅgiras, and Virocana the son of Prah-
lāda, because both wanted to marry the same girl
named Keśinī. Sudhanvā was a Brahmin whereas
Virocana was an Asura, who argued that Asura was
nobler than Brahmin and Sudhanvā said that it was the
other way. Both wagered their lives and accepted
Prahlāda as their judge. The decision of Prahlāda was
[Page407-a+ 64]
that the Brahmin was the nobler of the two. Because
Prahlāda said the truth Sudhanvā did not kill Viro-
cana. But Virocana had to wash the feet of Sudhanvā
in the presence of Keśinī, feet Sudhanvā married
Keśinī in the presence of Virocana. (M.B. Udyoga
Parva, Chapter 35).
