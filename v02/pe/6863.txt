SUBRAHMAṆYA¦. Son of Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Reason for birth.%} A son named Vajrāṅga was born to
Kaśyapaprajāpati by his wife Danu and he married a
girl called Varāṅgī. Vajrāṅga performed penance to
Brahmā so that he might shed his āsuric aspect. When
he came out of his penance, Varāṅgī was missing and he
wandered about the forest in search of her. Finally he saw
Varāṅgī crying under a tree. When he asked her the reason
for her weeping, she told him about harassments by Brahmā
during the thousand years when Vajrāṅga was immers-
ed in trance. Indra one day threw about the vessels
used by her in worship, appearing before her in the
guise of a monkey; on another occasion he threatened
her in the form of a lion and on a third occasion he
came disguised as a snake and bit on her legs. Very
much grieved over the story Vajrāṅga again took to
penance with the grim determination to punish Indra
and when Brahmā appeared before him he prayed for
the boon of a son who would surpass the Devas includ-
ing Indra in prowess. Brahmā granted him the boon.
Varāṅgī delivered a son twelve months after the boon.
The child was christened Tārakāsura.
<div n="NI"/>Tārakāsura, as a child, began practising penance and
Brahmā duly appeared before him and granted him
the boon that if he were to die, he would die at the
hands of a child only seven days old. Haughty over the
boon Tārakāsura very soon conquered the three worlds.
The devas found no means to suppress the asura. Child-
ren would not be born to them and there was a reason
for it. Once Śiva and Pārvatī started the marital act
and it did not come to a close even after a hundred
divya-years, with the result that the world shook like
anything. Frightened at this the Devas requested
Śiva to stop the act and he obliged them. Then he
asked them who would bear the semen which had been
discharged and they replied, “Let earth itself bear the
[Page747-b+ 65]
semen.” Accordingly it was discharged on the earth.
It filled and over-flowed forests and mountains.
What next was the problem. Ultimately the Devas
asked Agni (fire) to consume it. When Agni consumed
and burnt it down absolutely, the ashes thereof form-
ed into a white hill and it became a forest.
<div n="NI"/>Pārvatī did not at all relish the action of the devas and
spoke to them thus: “You prevented my sexual inter-
course entered into with the desire to have a son.
Therefore, in future you will not have children by your
wives.” Pārvatī cursed the earth also as follows:
“You will become one of various forms and also a wife
to many people. You, who prevented me from having
a son, will not enjoy happiness from children.” (Vālmī-
ki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, Canto 36).
<div n="NI"/>Tārakāsura could be killed only by a child not more
than seven days old and the Devas realised that such
a child could be begot only by Śiva. It was the occas-
ion when Śiva was lamenting over the death of Satī and
Pārvatī was doing penance to secure Śiva as husband.
None could stir Śiva immersed in deep meditation
and the Devas entrusted the responsibility for it to
Kāmadeva. Not only did Kāma not succeed in the
endeavour but also he got reduced to ashes by the fire
from Śiva's eyes. When Pārvatī's penance reached its
climax Śiva appeared before her and wedded her.
<div n="NI"/>2). {%Birth of Subrahmaṇya.%} Because of the power of
Śiva's semen consumed by Agni, his glow began getting
diminished. Agni complained of it to the Devas who
sent him over to Brahmā. On his way to Brahmā Agni
met Gaṅgādevī whom he told thus: “I can in no way
bear this semen of Śiva and if I get rid of it, it will
burn the entire world. So, you please take charge of it
so that you will have a noble son. Gaṅgā's reply to
this was simply to ask Agni to throw the semen into
her waters and Agni did so. As the semen had remained
with Agni for nearly 5000 years, his flesh, blood
hair, eye etc. had become golden in colour and hence
Agni came to be called from that day onwards
Hiraṇyaretas.
<div n="NI"/>Time passed by and the semen of Śiva became a burden
to Gaṅgā. She complained about that to Brahmā.
Brahmā asked her from whom she had received the
semen. Gaṅgā detailed her story to him and concluded
by saying that though it was 5000 years since Śiva's
semen was put into her, she did not deliver yet. Then
Brahmā told her as follows: “You go to the Udaya
mountain (where the sun rises). There is a forest there,
a forest hundred crores of yojanas in extent, where
Śara, a particular variety of grass (Saccharam munja
Roxb) grows. You deposit the semen there and a male
child will be born after 10,000 years.
<div n="NI"/>As directed by Brahmā Gaṅgā went to the Udaya
mountain and deposited the foetus there through her
mouth.
<div n="NI"/>By the power of Śiva's semen all the trees and animals
and birds in the forest became golden in colour.
When 10,000 years were completed a child, as effulgent
as the rising sun, was born and Subrahmaṇya was the
child. The child cried in a thunderous voice and six
divine Kṛttikās who came that way saw the child and
taking pity on it vied with one another to breast-feed
it. Since the child looked at the six Kṛttikās one after
the other it developed six faces and since it was breast-fed
by Kṛttikās it came to be named Kārttikeya as well.
[Page748-a+ 65]
Brahmā informed Agni about the birth of the child
and the latter, in great happiness, hastened to it on a
fast goat. Gaṅgā who met Agni on the way and asked
him about his hurried trip was told about the birth of
the child and between the two developed an argument
about the ownership of the child. Mahāviṣṇu who came
that way just then listened to the above argument and
directed them to Śiva for settlement of their claims.
<div n="NI"/>Agni and Gaṅgā asked Śiva to which of them the child
really belonged Śiva then told Pārvatī “Fortunate,
fortunate.” Only after seeing the child could it be
decided as to whose it was and so Śiva, Pārvatī, Agni
and Gaṅgā proceeded together to the forest where they
saw the child in the lap of the Kṛttikās. Śiva then
said “Let us see whom the child looks at before settling
its parentage.” Understanding the ideas of the visitors
the child, by its yogic power, assumed four bodies
called Kumāra, Viśākha, Śākha and Naigameya.
Kumāra looked at Śiva, Viśākha at Pārvatī, Śākha at
Gaṅgā and Naigameya at Agni and all of them felt
immensely happy. The Kṛttikās asked Śiva whether
Ṣaṇmukha (child with six faces) was his son to which
Śiva answered as follows: “Let him be your son under
the name Kārttikeya; Gaṅgā's son under the name
Kumāra; Pārvatī's son under the name Skanda; my
son under the name Guha and Agni's son with the
name Mahāsena and under the name Śaravaṇa ‘Śara-
vaṇa's (the forest where it was born) son. He is a
great yogī and will be known by these various names.
As he possesses six faces he will become famous as
‘Ṣaṇmukha’ also.
<div n="NI"/>After having spoken thus Śiva thought of the Devas
and under the leadership of Brahmā and Viṣṇu all the
Devas appeared there. They looked at the child to their
hearts’ content and then told Śiva thus: “Oh! Lord!
You made Agni serve the purpose of Devas. Let us
immediately start for Aujasa tīrtha and crown Ṣaṇ-
mukha at Sarasvatī in Kurukṣetra. Let him flourish
as army-chief of Devas, Gandharvas and Kinnaras and
let him kill the terrible Mahiṣāsura and Tārakāsura.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Coronation.%} Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Śiva and others reached
Kuruksetra with the child to crown him (Subrahmaṇya)
as army-chief. Śiva and Viṣṇu performed the consecra-
tion ceremony with holy water from the seven seas.
Gandharvas, Ṛṣis and others sang for joy and Apsarās
danced. Pārvatī placed the child thus consecrated on
her lap and kissed him repeatedly on the head.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Presents.%} After Guha's consecration, the Devas
presented the army-chief valorous armies. He was
given by Śiva four Pramathas, equal in prowess to
Indra, called Ghaṇṭākarna, Lohitākṣa, Nandiṣeṇa and
Kumudamālī. Brahmā and other Devas gave their
own Pramathas to him. Brahmā gave him the Pra-
matha called Sthāṇu and Viṣṇu gave him three sets of
Pramathas called Saṅkrama, Vikrama and Parākrama.
Indra gave him Utkleśa and Paṅkaja; Sun (Sūrya)
gave Daṇḍakapiñjalas; Moon gave Maṇivasumaṇis;
the Asvins gave Vatsanandis etc. In short, important
Devas, Mātṛs, Tīrthas etc. gave Subrahmaṇya price-
less presents too numerous to be named.
<div n="NI"/>Seeing the rush of presents the great Garuḍa presented
his own son, the fast-going Peacock to Subrahmanya.
Aruṇa gave his own son, the cock. Agni gave the Vel
(three-pronged weapon, trident), Bṛhaspati the daṇḍa
(club, stick) Gaṅgā, the Kamaṇḍalu (water-pot of
[Page748-b+ 65]
Sannyāsins) Viṣṇu the garland, Pārvatī clothes, Śiva
the locket and Indra the string of pearls.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Devāsura war.%} The consecration of Subrahmaṇya
as Commander-in-Chief of the army kindled a new
hope and enthusiasm in the Devas. They challenged
the Asuras for war and they took it up. The asura
army entered the battle-field under the leadership of
unrivalled warriors like Tārakāsura, Mahiṣa, Bāṇa,
son of Mahābali, Tāraka's sons, Tārakākṣa. Kamalā-
kṣa, Vidyunmālī etc. In the furious battle that ensued
Subrahmaṇya killed Tārakāsura. The other asura
chiefs too were killed.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Vow of celibacy.%} After the killing of Tārakāsura
Subrahmaṇya became the object of too much of petting
by Pārvatī with the result that his life became un-
bridled and wayward. His lust was everyday on the
increase and he committed even rape on Deva women,
who were ultimately forced to complain about him to
Pārvatī. Immediately she called Subrahmaṇya to her
and showed her own image in all other women and he
became so much repentant about his past actions that
he took the vow before Pārvatī that in future he would
look upon all women in the world as equal to her, his
mother. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa 81).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Marriage.%} See under Devasenā.

holding the Vel in his hands and he was named
Viśākha. Frightened by his sight Indra sought refuge
with Subrahmaṇya. (Vana Parva, Chapter 227).

serve as your food.” As soon as he finished speaking,
a terrible person just like Agni emerged from his body
and it was called Raudragraha, which is known also

Pūtanāgraha etc. This Graha is supposed to cause
