BAKA II¦. A demon. As young boys Śrī Kṛṣṇa and
Balarāmabhadra were once playing in Ambāḍi (Goku-
la) on the banks of the river Yamunā when the
demon, Baka, despatched by Kaṃsa, went to them in
the form of a huge terrible-looking stork. In no time
opening its ferocious beaks the stork swallowed Kṛṣṇa.
But the touch of Kṛṣṇa burnt the throat of the bird
and vomitting Kṛṣṇa the bird fell dead.
