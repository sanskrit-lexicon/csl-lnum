GAUTAMA¦. V. An ungrateful brahmin. He was born
in Madhyadeśa. He left his parents and after travelling
in many lands he came to a country of foresters. The
foresters received him with respect and he lived in a
hut of the foresters and married a lady from among
them.
<div n="NI"/>Gautama abandoned his brahminhood and accepted
the duties of foresters. He was living like this when
another brahmin boy came to that village. He searched
in vain for a brahmin house to stay for the night and
then knowing that a man born a brahmin but made
a forester by his duties was living there he went to his
house. Gautama also came there carrying the animals
and birds he had hunted down that day. His body
was bathed in blood. The brahmin guest felt com-
passion for Gautama and advised him to leave his
trade and go to his house in his country.
<div n="NI"/>In the morning the brahmin guest went away without
taking any food. The advice of his guest kept him
thinking. He decided to abandon his life as a hunter
and so leaving everything behind he went to the sea-
shore. He met some merchants on the way and while
they were travelling together a wild elephant attacked
them. Many were killed and Gautama escaping ran
swiftly and came to the base of a big banyan tree.
He was tired and slept there for a while.
<div n="NI"/>A big vulture named Nāḍījaṃgha lived on the top of
that banyan tree. He used to go out to worship Brahmā
at dusk and when he returned to his abode that day
he saw a man lying wearied down below. Gautama
attempted to catch the vulture and eat it but the
vulture playing a benign host placed before Gautama
food for him and made enquiries about him and asked
him the purpose of his travels. Gautama told him that
he was very poor and that he wanted to acquire some
wealth somehow.
<div n="NI"/>Nāḍījaṃgha then said that he would get for him enough
wealth from the demon-King Virūpākṣa who was an
intimate friend of his. Gautama was pleased. The
vulture fanned him and sent him to sleep. Next morn-
ing Nāḍījaṃgha sent Gautama to Virūpākṣa and the
demon gave Gautama as much gold as he could carry
on his shoulders.
<div n="NI"/>Gautama took the gold as a head load and came back
to the base of the banyan tree. Nāḍījaṃgha came to him
and they talked to each other for some time. Gautama
who had become a gluttonous flesh eater looked with
greed at the fat body of the vulture and in an instant
[Page287-a+ 64]
killed it and packed the flesh along with the load of
gold and went his way.
<div n="NI"/>Virūpākṣa did not see Nāḍījaṃgha for two days and he
was worried. He, therefore, sent his son to the banyan
tree to look for Nāḍījaṃgha. When he reached the
base of the tree he found to his grief only the bones
and feathers of his father's friend. He knew what had
happened and he immediately followed the ungrateful
brahmin and capturing him brought him to his father
bound hand and foot. Virūpākṣa without any mercy
cut him into pieces and threw them for the crows to
eat. But even the crows would not eat the flesh of such
an ungrateful man.
<div n="NI"/>Virūpākṣa burnt the remains of Nāḍījaṃgha in a
funeral pyre. Devas assembled in the skies to watch
the funeral. Then Surabhi sprinkled milk on the
funeral pyre and brought back Nāḍījaṃgha to life.
The reborn vulture felt sorry for Gautama and request-
ed Surabhi to restore to life the wretched Gautama
also. Gautama also was brought back to life and he
embraced Nāḍījaṃgha. Gautama then went away with
his load of gold.
<div n="NI"/>Gautama returned to Śabarālaya and there married a
Śūdra lady and begot evil sons. The devas were
offended at this and cursing him condemned him to
hell. (Chapters 168 to 173, Śānti Parva).
