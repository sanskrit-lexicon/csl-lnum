AŚMOPĀKHYĀNAM¦. This is called Aśmagītā also.
After the great Kurukṣetra battle Vyāsa spoke to
Dharmaputra to console him and the philosophy he
then expounded is called Aśmopākhyānam. Once King
Janaka asked the great scholar Aśman on the changes
that occur in Man as wealth comes and goes. Aśman
then gave the King the same philosophy which Vyāsa
gave to Dharmaputra and Aśman's oration to King
Janaka came to be known as Aśmagītā. (Chapter 28,
Śānti Parva, M.B.).
