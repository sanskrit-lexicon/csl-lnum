NAMUCI I¦. A fierce Rākṣasa (giant). It is stated in
Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 65, Stanza 22, that
this giant was the son of Prajāpati Kaśyapa by his wife
Danu. This fierce giant was killed by Indra. There is
a story in the Purāṇas describing how Namuci was
killed.
<div n="NI"/>Under the leadership of Namuci a great army of the
giants invaded the realm of the gods. Indra came with
an army of devas. Though the giants were defeated in
the battle Indra was not able to kill Namuci. To save
himself from the attack of Indra, Namuci got into the
radiance of the Sun and hid himself there. Indra found
him out and made a treaty with him, the conditions of
which were as said by Indra:—
<div n="NI"/>“Oh, noble giant, I will not kill you by wet thing or
dry thing, in the night or in the day. What I say is
true.”
<div n="NI"/>According to this treaty it became impossible for Indra
to kill Namuci either with wet things or with dry things
and either in the day time or in the night. Only when
Indra had agreed to these conditions did Namuci come
out.
<div n="NI"/>The battle continued and Indra drove away Śumbha
and Niśumbha the elder brothers of Namuci, who went
to Pātāla. Indra ran after Namuci and in the evening
Indra found him hiding on the sea shore and killed him
[Page523-b+ 64]
with the foam of the sea. As Indra had violated the condi-
tion of the treaty the severed head of Namuci followed
Indra. With this Indra incurred the sin of Brahma-
hatyā (killing a Brahmin). To get remission from this
sin Indra approached Brahmā. He was advised to bathe
in Aruṇāsaṅgama and doing so Indra got remission of
his sin. From that day onwards Aruṇāsaṅgama became
a holy bath (tīrtha). (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 40).
