UCCAIŚŚRAVAS I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} A horse which emerged from water during
the churning of the sea of Milk. (See under Kṣīrābdhi-
mathana). Devendra grabbed it the moment he saw it,
and thenceforth it became his vehicle. (M.B. Ādi
Parva, Chapter 23, Verses 33-37).

<div n="NI"/>2) {%Colour of the horse.%} Once, during a controversy, Vinatā,
wife of Kaśyapa, contended that the colour of Uccaiśśra-
vas was white, while another wife of Kaśyapa, Kadrū
said that its tail was black in colour. It was decided to bet
that she who got defeated in this controversy should
become the slave of the winner. Because the serpents,
the sons of Kadrū, cheated Vinatā, she had to become
Kadrū's slave. (See under Vinatā). (M.B. Ādi Parva,
Chapter 20).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Lakṣmīdevī became mare.%} Devī Bhāgavata relates a
story of Mahālakṣmī becoming a mare on account of
Uccaiś ravas. King Revanta, son of Sūrya and friend of
Indra, once went to Vaikuṇṭha to pay his respects to
Bhagavān Viṣṇu, riding on Uccaiśśravas. Mahālakṣmī,
who was then with Viṣṇu was surprised at the arri-
val of Revanta. Seeing the scintillating form of
Uccaiśśravas, her brother, Mahālakṣmi sat looking at
the horse unmindful of all other things. (Mahālakṣmī
and the horse were both born from the Sea of Milk and
hence were sister and brother). Thus occupied Mahā-
lakṣmī did not hear Mahāviṣṇu asking, “Who is this one
who comes like a second Cupid?” Angry at this Viṣṇu
said—
<div n="NI"/>“So much attracted by the horse, you have not answered
me. Because you enjoy (Ramasi) so much your name in
future will be Ramā. You will also become frivolous
like an uncultured woman. You have never been
constant. Because you felt so much attracted to this
horse in my very presence, you will be born as a mare
in the world of men.”
<div n="NI"/>According to this curse Mahālakṣmī had to be born as
a mare in the world; the Hehaya dynasty had its origin
from her. (See under Ekavīra). (Devī Bhāgavata,
Skandha 6).
