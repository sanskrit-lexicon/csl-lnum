PIṆḌIKĀ¦. A stool to install idols. The length of this
stool should be equal to that of the idol. The breadth
should be its half and the thickness equal to that is
the breadth. The exact place where the idol is fixed of
called Mekhalā and the hole in the mekhalā should

slightly slant towards the north. The pipe (exit hole for
the water to flow out) called Praṇāla should be as
wide as a fourth part of the area of the pīṭha. For a
praṇāla of a Śiva temple the length of the same should
be half of that of the Piṇḍikā.
<div n="NI"/>The sanctum sanctorum of the temple should be divid-
ed into seven divisions and the Piṇḍikā should be
fixed by a learned priest in the Brāhmabhāga of the
garbhagṛha (sanctum sanctorum). (Chapters 50 and
60, Agni Purāṇa).
