the author of the famous works—“Ṛgveda Anu-
kramaṇī”, “Āraṇyakam”, “Ṛkprātiśākhya”, etc.
<div n="NI"/>The famous Āśvalāyanācārya was Śaunaka's disciple.
Ācāryas like Kātyāyana, Patañjali and Vyāsa belonged
to his class. Śaunaka's real name was “Gṛtsamada”. It
was because he was the son of Śunaka that he got the
name “Śaunaka”.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Śaunahotra, the son of the sage Śunahotra,
once performed a yāga. Indra attended that yāga. At
that time Śaunahotra rescued Indra from an attack of
the Asuras. Indra who was pleased at this, blessed
Śaunahotra that he would be born in his next birth in
the Bhṛgu family under the name “Śaunaka”.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Genealogy%} In Vāyu Purāṇa his genealogy is given in
two forms.

<div n="NI"/>ii) Dharmavṛddha—Śunahotra—Gṛtsamada—
Śunaka—Śaunaka. (Vāyu Purāṇa, 92, 26).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Important works.%} Śaunaka is believed to be the author

Śaunakasmṛti (10) Caraṇavyūha and (11) Ṛgvidhāna.
Matsya Purāṇa, Chapter 252 mentions that Śaunaka
had written a work on the science of architecture.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Disciples.%} The chief disciple of Śaunaka was Āśva-
lāyana. Once Āśvalāyana wrote and dedicated to his
Guru (master) two treatises entitled “Gṛhyasūtra” and
“Śrautasūtra” to please him. After reading it, Śaunaka
destroyed his own work on “Śrautaśāstra”. Āśvalāyana
wrote his treatise after having studied the ten works of
Śaunaka on Ṛgveda.
<div n="NI"/>Kātyāyana, the disciple of Āśvalāyana later received
the ten books written by Śaunaka and the three books
written by Āśvalāyana. Kātyāyana gave his disciple
Patañjali, the two works, “Yajurvedakalpasūtra” and
“Sāmaveda Upagrantha” which were written by him-
self. From this we may infer that the series of Śaunaka's
disciples was as follows:—Śaunaka—Āśvalāyana—
Kātyāyana—Patañjali—Vyāsa.
