DRUHYU I¦. A son of King Yayāti. Two sons, Yadu
and Turvasu were born to Yayāti, the son of Nahuṣa,
by his wife Devayānī and three sons Druhyu, Anudru-
hyu and Pūru by his wife Śarmiṣṭhā. Druhyu was cursed
by his father because he did not comply with the re-
quest of his father to exchange his old age with the
youth of his son. The curse was that his desires
would not be realized, that he would stay in places
where he would not like to stay that his kingdom would
be lost and that he would be called Bhoja. (See under
Yayāti).
