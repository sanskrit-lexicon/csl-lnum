KADALIGARBHĀ¦. Daughter of the great sage
Maṅkaṇaka. There is a story about her in Kathāsarit-
sāgara.
<div n="NI"/>There was once a city called Ikṣumatī. It was on the
banks of the river Ikṣumatī. It was Viśvāmitra who
set up that river and city. In a hermitage in the thick
forest on the shores of Ikṣumatī lived a sage, Maṅka-
ṇaka performing penance. One day the beautiful
nymph Menakā, came there from above. As a wind
blew, her upper garment was displaced. Seeing her
bare body, Maṅkaṇaka had emission. The semen of
[Page363-a+ 65]
the sage fell into a Kadalī (plantain) tree and from
there arose a maiden, extremely beautiful. Because she
was born from Kadalī she was called Kadalīgarbhā.
Kadalīgarbhā grew up into a beautiful lady and one
day a King named Dṛḍhavarmā came that way while
hunting and seeing Kadalīgarbhā he fell in love with her
and married her with the permission of Maṅkaṇaka.
The Devas advised her to scatter musṭard seeds on the
way to her husband's house and in case her husband
abandoned her she should be guided by the mustard
plants to return home. She did so.
<div n="NI"/>One day by the evil advice of a barber the King
divorced her and she returned to the Āśrama by
following the young mustard plants. But Maṅkaṇaka
took her back to the King. (Taraṅga 6, Madanamañ-
jukālambaka, Kathāsaritsāgara).
