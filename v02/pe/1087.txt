BHĀSA¦. A very prominent dramatist in Sanskrit. As
Bāṇa and Kālidāsa have noticed him in their works,
it may safely be assumed that Bhāsa lived in an earlier
period. Since Pratimā nāṭaka and Abhiṣeka nāṭaka,
which are universally admitted to have been composed
by Bhāsa, depend for their themes on the Vālmīki
[Page126-b+ 65]
Rāmāyaṇa, it is clear that Bhāsa lived after Vālmīki.
Kālidāsa's period has not yet been fixed beyond doubt.
It is almost settled that Bāṇa lived sometime between the
sixth and seventh centuries A.D. Prof. Keith has been
of the view that Vālmīki lived before the 4th century
B.C. In the light of all such factors it could be presumed
that Bhāsa lived in the period between the 4th century
B.C. and 6th century A.D.
<div n="NI"/>Though Bhāsa has so many glories to his credit he does
not fully match Kālidāsa, and this might have been the
reason why Indians did almost forget Bhāsa with the
advent of Kālidāsa on the literary arena.
<div n="NI"/>We are not in a position to name with unerring definite-
ness the works of Bhāsa. The general belief is that he
has written nearly twenty three dramas. In 1922, Pandit
Gaṇapati Śāstrī unearthed from various sources thirteen
dramas of Bhāsa. Three out of them, viz. Pratijñā-
yaugandharāyaṇa, Śvapnavāsavadatta and Avimā-
raka owe their themes to the Bṛhatkathā, while Prati-
mā nāṭaka and Abhiṣeka nāṭaka have Rāmāyaṇa as
their basic inspiration. Out of the eight remaining
dramas six, viz. Madhyama vyāyoga, Pañcarātra, Dūta-
vākya, Dūtaghaṭotkaca, Karṇabhāra and Ūrubhaṅga
owe their themes to the Mahābhārata, while the last
two dramas, Bālacarita and Cārudatta are dependent
for their themes on anecdotes about Śrī Kṛṣṇa and on
yakṣa stories.
<div n="NI"/>Though Dr. Gaṇapati Śāstrī has strongly contended that
all the above thirteen dramas were written by Bhāsa
himself, his view has not yet received universal accep-
tance. Whatever that be, it is an admitted fact that
Svapnavāsavadatta is by far the best among the thirteen
dramas. It is a continuation of the story of Pratijñāyau-
gandharāyaṇa. The wedding of king Udayana and
Vāsavadattā is the subject matter of Svapnavāsava-
datta.
<div n="NI"/>With his killing of the Rākṣasa ‘Avi’ the Sauvīra king
comes to be known as Avimāra, and Avimāra's falling
in love with Kuraṅgī, daughter of Kuntibhoja forms the
theme of the drama, Avimāraka. In Pratimā nāṭaka
is told the story narrated in Rāmāyaṇa from Ayodhyā-
kāṇḍa to Paṭṭābhiṣeka. Abhiṣeka nāṭaka codifies the
stories in the Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa and Sundara Kāṇḍa of
the Ṛāmāyaṇa and describes the coronations of Sugrīva
and of Śrī Rāma. Though the characters in Pañcarātra
are borrowed from Mahābhārata the story is entirely
Bhāsa's. Madhyama vyāyoga, Dūtavākya, Dūtaghaṭot-
kaca, Karṇabhāra and Ūrubhaṅga are one-act plays.
These five plays have as their basis some of the anecdotes
in the Mahābhārata. In Cārudatta is treated the love
story of Cārudatta and Vasantasenā.
<div n="NI"/>Indisputable evidence is still lacking to credit Bhāsa
with the authorship of all the thirteen plays referred to
above.
