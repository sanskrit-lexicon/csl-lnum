VIŚVAVEDĪ¦. A minister of King Śauri. This minister
wanted the King to be just. Śauri and his four brothers
Khanitra, Udāvasu, Sunaya and Mahāratha were the
sons of Prajāpati. The main ruler of the kingdom was
Khanitra. The others were Governors of the East, West
North and South divisions of the kingdom. The four
brothers had a priest each named Suhotra, Kuśāvarta,
Pramati and Vasiṣṭha respectively.
<div n="NI"/>Viśvavedī gathered these four priests together and
created four wicked fairies and sent them against
Khanitra the King. The fierce fairies attacked Khanitra.
But because of his purity and cleanliness the fairies
had to admit defeat. The fairies came back and
attacked their creators, the four priests and Viśvavedī
who had planned the programme, and killed all the five
of them. (Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa, Chapter 314).
