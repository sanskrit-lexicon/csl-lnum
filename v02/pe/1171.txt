BHOJA V¦. A king of Kānyakubja. Once this king Bhoja
met a woman with a fantastic shape. Her body was of
[Page139-a+ 65]
human shape while her face was that of a female deer.
When the king asked her about her strange shape, she
related her past history as follows:—“In my previous
birth, I was a female deer. On one occasion the whole
of my body except my face, was plunged in a river and
those parts of the body under the water were transformed
into human shape. From that day, I have been changed
into this form.”
<div n="NI"/>On hearing her story, the king took her to the holy river
and immersed her again in it. She was at once trans-
formed into an actual woman and the king married her.
(Skanda Purāṇa, 7-2-2).
