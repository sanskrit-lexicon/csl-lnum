PAYOṢṆĪ¦. A holy river. This river starts from the
Vindhya mountains and flows to the west. Nala and
Damayantī walked through the banks of this river.
(Chapter 61, Vana Parva). Those who bathe in this
river will get the benefit of doing a thousand godānas
(gifts of cows). There is a sacred place on the shores of
this river called Varāhatīrtha. King Nṛga performed a
Yāga at this place at which Indra came and had
Somapāna and the brahmins received dakṣiṇā (fees)
and got drunk. (Chapters 88 and 121, Vana Parva).
Even the mere contact of water-drops of Payoṣṇī river
would absolve one of all sins. The musical instrument
Śṛṅga of Śiva is in this river. Dharmaputra once came
to this river and stayed there for some time drinking
its water. (Chapter 120, Vana Parva). On another
occasion Gaya son of King Amūrtarayas conducted
seven aśvamedhas at this place and pleased Indra.
(Chapter 21, Anuśāsana Parva).
