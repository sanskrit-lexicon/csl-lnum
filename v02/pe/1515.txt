CĀVEṬṬUPAṬA¦. (CĀVERU). (Paṭa = army).
<div n="NI"/>A particular division of the army which in olden days
used to come forward to lay down their lives in the
service of the country. When defeat in war was almost
certain for their king an army division under royal
[Page181-a+ 64]
leadership was formed of heroes, who took their last
leave of their homes and people. The soldiers left their
homes with their head and eyebrows shaved, and people
gave them a hearty send-off. Either victory or death
in battlefield was their slogan. This system originated
in Kerala. Imitating Kerala, Turkey and Egypt formed
their own division of Cāveṭṭupaṭa in the 15th century.
The Cāveṭṭupaṭa of Turkey called the Janissary was
formed out of poor Christians captured in war, and that
of Egypt called Mamaluk was formed out of slaves.
But, the Cāveṭṭupaṭa of ancient Kerala was self-orga-
nised out of burning love for their king and country.
The families of those warriors of the pata who died in
fight were allotted royal favours. Even before, in the 14th
century A.D. there existed in Kerala this system of
Cāveṭṭupaṭa. From A.D. 1090 to 1111 A.D. many fierce
wars were fought between Kerala and the Cola country,
and it was perhaps during this period that this system of
fighting came into vogue. Certain inscriptions of the
period go to prove that Rāmavarmakulaśekhara Cakra-
varti who ruled Kerala during the above period drove
out the Colas from Quilon and captured places up to
Koṭṭar.
<div n="NI"/>Foreign writers have also referred to the Cāveṭṭupaṭa.
“Amouces” and “Amochi” used in the ‘Rise of Portu-
guese power in India’ indicate the Cāveṭṭupaṭa. “In
the war between Cochin and Calicut in 1504 three
princes of Cochin were killed, one of them being the
nephew of the ruling monarch. On his death 200
Cāveṭṭu warriors who formed the body-guard of the
nephew rushed to the field after shaving their heads
and eyebrows and killed all the enemies they saw.”
