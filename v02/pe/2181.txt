DURMADA II¦. A son of Haṃsa, the Gandharva King.
Himself and Unmadā, the apsarā woman impersonated
themselves and cheated Purūravas and Urvaśī (See
Unmadā). Enraged at the deception Urvaśī cursed
that Durmada be born as a Rākṣasa and Unmadā a
princess. Also, Unmadā as princess would have to marry
not the person she really loved but some one else.
Both Durmada and Unmadā then begged Urvaśī for
[Page255-b+ 65]
redemption from the curse and the latter said thus:
“This Durmada will be born as son of Unmadā, and
on seeing her son and husband die, she will end her
life by burning herself, and her soul will attain Svarga”.
<div n="NI"/>As a result of the above curse Unmadā was born as
the daughter of the King of Videha and Durmada as
the son of the Rākṣasa called Dīrghajaṃgha. As Rākṣasa,
Durmada was called Piṅgalākṣa. The King of Videha
named Unmadā as Hariṇī.
<div n="NI"/>While Hariṇī was once walking in the garden with her
companions Piṅgalākṣa abducted her and flew off in
the sky, and put her in a great forest. A prince called
Vasumanas, who happened to come that way on his
fast-riding horse Jīmūta heard the lamentations of
Hariṇī, and after killing Piṅgalākṣa he took her with
him to her palace. The King of Videha and his sub-
jects, who were in great anxiety and distress at the
disappearance of Hariṇī felt really happy to have her
back. And, all of them opined that Hariṇī should be
married to Vasumanas. Accordingly the date for her
Svayaṃvara was announced. But, on the day of the
svayaṃvara Bhadraśreṇya, King of Hehaya who, along
with other Kings was also present on the occasion,
forcibly took Hariṇī and rode off with her. According
to the condition laid down by Urvaśī for redemption
from her curse Durmada was born as son of Hariṇī and
he was named Durmada.
<div n="NI"/>Bhadraśreṇya, Hariṇī and Durmada lived very happily
in the Hehaya palace. When Durmada came of age he
married Citrāṅgī, his uncle's daughter on the advice
of sage Garga. Soon war broke out between Bhadra-
śreṇya, and Divodāsa, King of Kāṣi in which Bhadra-
śreṇya was killed. Hariṇī courted death by fire,
regained her former life and under the name Unmadā
returned to the world of the Apsaras.
