RAIKVA¦. There was a noble King in ancient India
named Jānaśruti. The following is a story about the
fame of this King.
<div n="NI"/>One night while this King was sleeping, some hermits
took the form of swans and were flying through the air.
One of them saw the radiance of the fame of Jānaśruti
shining brightly. The other swans said that the fame
of Raikva was far greater than this. Jānaśruti heard
this. He found out Raikva and placed all his wealth
at the foot of Raikva and gave him his daughter in
marriage.
