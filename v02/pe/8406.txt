VĪRABHADRA¦. One of the guards of Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin.%} There are two different opinions in the Purā-
ṇas, regarding the origin of Vīrabhadra. There is no
doubt that his birth was due to the anger of Śiva. When
Śiva knew that his wife Pārvatī jumped into the fire and
died at the sacrifice of Dakṣa, he struck his matted hair
on the ground and from that, Vīrabhadra and Bhadra-
kālī came into being. This is the version given in Devī
Bhāgavata, Skandha 7. According to Mahābhārata,
Śānti Parva, Chapter 284, Vīrabhadra was born from
the mouth of Śiva. From each of the hairpores of Vīra-
bhadra, who was born from the mouth of Śiva to destroy
the sacrifice of Dakṣa a fearful monster was born, all
of whom, formed a group of ghosts called the Raumyas.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The Destruction of the sacrifice of Dakṣa.%} See under
Dakṣa.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Attainment of boon.%} After the destruction of the sacri-
fice of Dakṣa, the fearful monster Vīrabhadra, began to
exterminate the entire creation. Then Śiva appeared
and pacified him and said “You shall become a planet
in the sky called Aṅgarakṣaka (Bodyguard) or Maṅgala
(well being). Everybody will worship you. Those who
thus exalt you, will get health, wealth and long life.”
(Bhāgavata, Skandha 7; Vāyu Purāṇa, 101, 209; Padma
Purāṇa, Sṛṣṭi Khaṇḍa, 24).
<div n="NI"/>After the destruction of the sacrifice of Dakṣa, Vīra-
bhadra severed a portion of his radiance, and from that
radiance, later Ādiśaṅkara (Śaṅkarācārya) was born.
This story occurs in Bhaviṣya Purāṇa, Pratisarga Parva.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Prowess.%} Vīrabhadra was not only a follower of
Śiva. He was a prominent general of the army. In the
battle of the burning of Tripura and the Jalandhara
fight, Vīrabhadra stood with Śiva and fought fiercely.
(Padma Purāṇa, Pātāla Khaṇḍa and Uttara Khaṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Protector of the Devas.%} Vīrabhadra was the destroyer
of the Asuras and the protector of the Devas. Once
[Page859-b+ 65]
Kaśyapa and all the other hermits and sages with him
were burnt to ashes in the wild fire that occurred in the
Śaukaṭa mountain. Instantly Vīrabhadra swallowed
that wild fire and by the power of incantation, he bro-
ught to life from the ashes all the Ṛṣis (hermits) who
were burnt to death.
<div n="NI"/>On another occasion a serpent swallowed all the gods.
Vīrabhadra killed the snake and rescued all the Devas.
Once an asura called Pañcameḍhra put into his mouth
all the gods, all the hermits and Bāli and Sugrīva.
Those who escaped from the danger stood agape being
powerless to confront the Asura. At last Vīrabhadra
attacked the asura. That great and fierce battle lasted
for years. At the end Vīrabhadra killed the Asura and
rescued all.
<div n="NI"/>Because Vīrabhadra had thus protected the Devas and
the others on three occasions, Śiva became immensely
pleased with him and gave him several boons. (Padma
Purāṇa, Pātāla Khaṇḍa, 107).
