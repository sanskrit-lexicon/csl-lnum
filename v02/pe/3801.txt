KUMBHA¦. II. Son of Kumbhakarṇa, whose wife
Vajrajvālā bore him two sons called Kumbha and
Nikumbha. Both of them were very powerful, and
Kumbha, in the Rāma-Rāvaṇa war defeated the army
of monkeys on various occasions. Many of the ministers
of Sugrīva tried to defeat Kumbha. Aṅgada, son of
Bāli also could not stand up to him. Then Sugrīva
fought against Kumbha and flung him into the sea
when the water in it rose up to the level of mount
Vindhya. Kumbha came ashore from the sea roaring
but was fisted to death by Sugrīva. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
Yuddha Kāṇḍa, Canto 76).
