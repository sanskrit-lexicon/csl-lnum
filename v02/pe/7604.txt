<div n="NI"/>(i) Ekata, Dvita and Trita were born to clean the
hands of the devas when they become smeared with
the sacrificial butter during the yāgas. Of these Trita
once fell into a well while drawing water and the
asuras closed the well. But Trita escaped opening the
top. (Sūkta 52, Anuvāka 10, Maṇḍala 1, Ṛgveda).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Once Ekata, Dvita and Trita were stranded in a
desert and desperately needed water to quench an in-
creasing thirst. At last they found a well and Trita after
getting down and quenching his thirst brought water
to his brothers. The cruel brothers, after drinking the
water pushed Trita into the well and covered the well
with the wheel of a bullock-cart. Trita prayed to the
Aśvinīdevas for help and they appeared before him
and rescued him from the well. (Sūkta 105, Maṇḍala 1,
Ṛgveda).
