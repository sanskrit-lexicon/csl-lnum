Divodāsa.
<div n="NI"/>Divodāsa's great grandfather's father, Kāśa had many
sons. They were called the Kāśis. It was from Kāśa's
reign that Vārāṇasī came to be called Kāśī. (Hari
Vaṃśa, Chapter 29).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Divodāsa's Reign.%} When Divodāsa began his rule in
Vārāṇasī, there was a Rākṣasa named Kṣemaka.
Divodāsa killed him and extended his kingdom. At
that stage, Bhadraśreṇya, King of Hehayas invaded
Divodāsa. Divodāsa killed the hundred sons of Bhadra-
śreṇya. At that time the sage Kuṃbhaka (Nikumbha)
came to Kāśī. His practice was to live fora thousand
years at any place where he reached at the time of
dusk. Since he had reached Vārāṇasī at dusk, he set up
an āśrama and lived there for a thousand years. At
that time there was a famine in Vārāṇasī. The whole
land was in the grip of a severe drought. Kumbhaka's
āśrama and its surroundings alone remained green and
cool. Herdsmen used to take cattle to graze in the
neighbourhood of the āśrama. Once when they retur-
ned in the evening, they took with their cows, the
sacrificial cow of Kumbhaka. It was dark and the sage
searched for the cow everywhere but could not trace
its whereabouts At last he came to know by intuition
that his cow was taken away by the herdsmen. In his
rage he cursed that Vārāṇasī should be ruined and left
the place with his disciples. (See under Kumbhaka).
<div n="NI"/>The story of the ruin of Vārāṇasī in Harivaṃsa is diff-
erent. It was the time when Śiva had married Pārvatī,
the daughter of Himavān. After marriage Śiva shifted
his residence to his wife's house. Śiva whose task was
to look after the affairs of the world, was never availa-
ble for the purpose at Kailāsa, his own seat.
The gods were in a helpless condition. They ap-
proached Pārvatī's mother, Menā and requested her
[Page245-b+ 65]
to persuade Śiva to return to his own place by any
means. Menā called her daughter and ridiculed her
husband as a vagabond who had no place to lay his
head on. Pārvatī could not bear this insult. Her mother's
stinging remarks got circulation in Devaloka. So she
urged Śiva to settle down somewhere on earth with her.
Śiva agreed and promised to take up residence at
Kāśī.
<div n="NI"/>The ruler of Kāśī in those days was Divodāsa. It was
a prosperous period in the country. As a rule, man
turns to God only when faced with misfortunes. So
Śiva decided to bring about a famine among the people
of the country by ruining it. For that he sent sage
Kumbhaka to Vārāṇasī. Kumbhaka arrived in Kāśī
and appeared to the barber Karṇaka to whom he
communicated Śiva's intentions. The barber cheerfully
fell in with the proposal and built a temple on the
next day for the residence of Kumbhaka. Living in
the temple, Kumbhaka began to participate in the
spiritual matters of the people. His blessings were much
sought after and people came to have deep faith in
him.
<div n="NI"/>Divodāsa had no children. He had made many pious
offerings to gods and performed many holy rites for
removing his wife's sterility, but it was all in vain.
At last, at the King's suggestion, she began to offer
pūjā to Kumbhaka praying for issue. But even after
a long period of devoted worship, she received no
blessing or boon from the sage. Moved by the pathetic
condition of his queen, Suyaśas, Divodāsa reproached
Kumbhaka very severely. He reprimanded him for
denying his blessings to the queen while he was shower-
ing them on all and sundry in the country. Provoked
at the King's rebuke, Kumbhaka pronounced a curse
that the country should be ruined. As a result of it the
country began to decline. (Harivaṃśa, Chapter 29).
<div n="NI"/>Śiva and Pārvatī came and settled down in Vārāṇasī.
After some years, Pārvatī began to press her husband
to leave the place and to go somewhere else. Śiva was
not inclined to do so. He said the place was “Avimu-
kta” and therefore insisted that he would not leave
it. From that time the place came to be called
“Avimukta.”
<div n="NI"/>3) Other details.
<div n="NI"/>(1) Towards the end of his life Divodāsa became a
Rājarṣi (Royal Saint). There are numerous references
to this Rājarṣi in the Ṛgveda. Since Divodāsa was of
a very hospitable nature he was known by another
name, “Atithigva”. In Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala, 16th
Anuvāka, 127th Sūkta, we read that once he hid him-
self under water to escape from an Asura called
Śaṃbara.
<div n="NI"/>(2) Divodāsa had a son named “Parucchepa”, who
was a Ṛṣi. Ṛgveda 1st Maṇḍala 19th Anuvāka, 127th
Sūkta relates to Parucchepa.
<div n="NI"/>(3) Bhīmaratha, the father of Divodāsa, had two other
names, Bhīmasena, and Sudeva. Divodāsa purchased
Mādhavī, the daughter of Yayāti after paying two
hundred Śyāmakarṇāśvas (beautiful horses with dark-
coloured ears) to Gālava, so that he might have chil-
dren. After the birth of his children, he returned
Mādhavī to her father. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter
117).
<div n="NI"/>(4) He sits in Yama's assembly and offers Pūjā to
Yama. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 8, Verse 12).
[Page246-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(5) Divodāsa once plundered the accessories of his
enemies. Agnihotra vanished after it. (M.B. Śānti
Parva, Chapter 96, Verse 21).
<div n="NI"/>(6) It was at the behest of Indra that Divodāsa built
the city of Vāraṇasī (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter
30, Verse 16).
<div n="NI"/>(7) Once Divodāsa fought with the King of Hehaya
for one thousand days. After having lost his army he went
to the sage Bharadvāja and performed Putrakāmeṣṭi
sacrifice. As a result of it a son Pratardana was born
to him. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 30).
<div n="NI"/>(8) Other names for Divodāsa used in the Mahābhā-
rata are—Bhaimaseni, Kāśīśa, Saudeva, Sudevatanaya
etc.
<div n="NI"/>DIVYĀDEVĪ. Daughter of Divodāsa, King of Plakṣa-
dvīpa. There is a story about this princess in Padma
Purāṇa, Bhūmikhaṇḍa, Chapters 85, 88.
<div n="NI"/>Divodāsa decided to give his daughter Divyā in
marriage to Citrasena, King of Rūpadeśa. But just
before the day fixed for the marriage Citrasena died
prematurely. So, as advised by the Brāhmaṇas who had
come there she was married to Rūpasena. He also died
soon after. She was subsequently married to 21 persons
in turn, and all of them died one by one.
<div n="NI"/>Everyone took pity on her for her ill-fate. At last, at the
suggestion of the ministers, preparations were made for
her svayaṃvara. Here also ill-luck pursued her. All
the princes who arrived to take part in the svayaṃvara
killed each other in mutual fight. Depressed and embit-
tered by all this, Divyā decided to renounce all worldly
pleasures and proceeded to the forest.
<div n="NI"/>Once Śuka named Ujjvala came to Plakṣadvīpa.
Moved to pity at the grief-stricken Divyā he taught her
“Aśūnyaśayana” vrata. When she practised this vrata
with devotion for about four years, Mahāviṣṇu appeared
before her and took her with him to Viṣṇuloka.
