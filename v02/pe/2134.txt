DROṆA I¦. The teacher in archery of the Pāṇḍavas and
the Kauravas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Droṇa was the son of Bharadvāja who had his
hermitage erected on the bank of the Ganges. Once
Bharadvāja went to bathe in the river. When he got
into the river he saw the celestial maid Ghṛtācī. The cele-
stial maid ran away as soon as she saw the hermit. But
her cloth was caught in grass and slipped off her body.
When the hermit saw the complete form of her body
which was bright and beautiful, he had seminal discharge.
The discharged semen was kept in a Droṇa (trough).
A child was born from that and he was named
Droṇa, who was brought up in the hermitage. (M.B.
Ādi Parva, Chapter 13).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Education and Marriage.%} Droṇa learned the art of
using weapons from his father and the hermit Agniveśa.
Drupada the prince of Pāñcāla was the fellow student
of Droṇa. They became great friends. On completion
of education Drupada returned to Pāñcāla. Droṇa
married Kṛpī the daughter of Śaradvān. A son was born
to them. At his birth the child neighed like the horse
Uccaiḥśravas; so his parents named him Aśvatthāmā.
Hearing that Paras urāma was giving Brāhmaṇas free
gift of wealth and property, Droṇa reached there.
Droṇa's desire was to get Dhanurveda (the art of
archery). Droṇa with his disciples went to Mahendra-
giri and saw Paraśurāma, who was about to enter forest
giving away everything he had. Paraśurāma said, “I
have given away to the Brāhmaṇas gold and everything
I had. The land I had conquered is given to Kaśyapa.
Now there remains only my body and some weapons.
You can have one of them.”
<div n="NI"/>Droṇa preferred the weapons. Thus Droṇa got the
entire armoury of Paraśurāma. (M.B. Ādi Parva,
Chapter 13).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%He became the teacher of the Pāṇḍavas and the Kauravas.%}
After receiving dhanurveda from Paraśurāma Droṇa
went to Pāñcāla. Drupada who had been a fellow
student of Droṇa was the King of Uttarapañcāla. then.
Though Droṇa had become proficient in archery, he
was very poor.
<div n="NI"/>He had no money even to buy milk for his child. Once
the playmates of Aśvatthāmā made him drink a mix-
ture of water and flour saying that it was milk. So
Droṇa approached Drupada for financial help. But
Drupada shunned his fellow student, scolded him and
sent him away without giving any help. Droṇa vowed
that he would, somehow or other, take revenge upon
Drupada and departed from Pāñcāla.
<div n="NI"/>The aim of Droṇa was to get some capable disciples. He
reached Hastināpura and stayed in disguise with Gautama
for a while. Once the Pāṇḍavas and the Kauravas who
were boys were engaged in the game of Kāra (a kind
of cricket play) outside the palace premises. The ball
fell in a well by chance. The princess stood round the
well and began to ponder how to get the ‘ball’ out of
the well. They tried all means but in vain. At that
time a Brāhmaṇa of dark complexion, short and aged,
came by that way. It was Droṇa. The boys gathered
round the old man. Droṇa threw his ring also into the
<F>1. To take revenge on Drupada was the thought that was uppermost in the mind of Droṇa.</F>
[Page248-b+ 64]
well and said: “Your kingly qualities are very poor.
Your education in using weapons is not complete. If
you give me a meal I will get both the ring and the
ball together” The boys agreed to the conditions.
Droṇa took a grass and evoked arrow into it by mantra
(spell) and shot it at the ‘Kāra’. The next grass was
shot at the first grass. It struck the first grass. Thus he
shot grasses one after another till the grass reached the
brink of the well and by pulling the grass he took the ball
out. In the same way he took the ring also out of the
well. When they got the ‘Kāra’ the boys stood round
Droṇa and asked him what he would like as the reward
for his deed. Droṇa said that they need only tell Bhīṣma
how a short man of dark complexion took the ball out of
the well. Accordingly the boys went to Bhīṣma and
told him everything. Immediately Bhīṣma understood
that it was Droṇa. Bhīṣma thought that Droṇa was the
best person to teach the princes. So Droṇa was brought to
the palace and was engaged as the teacher in archery.
(M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapters 130 and 131).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Education in Archery of the Kauravas and reward.%}
<div n="NI"/>(a) {%First vow.%} Droṇa asked the Pāṇḍavas and the Kau-
ravas to sit together and then told them. “There is one
thing that you should do for me when your education
is over”. Hearing this they all kept silent. But Arjuna
came forward and took the vow that he would achieve
that task according to the wish of the teacher.
<div n="NI"/>{%(b) The disciple who is second to none.%} The training in
weapons commenced. Hearing of the fame of Droṇa,
disciples came from places far and near. Arjuna was
the first of all the students. Sending all the students to
fetch water Droṇa taught his son Aśvatthāmā certain
special lessons. Arjuna secretly knew this. So he
brought water as quickly as possible before the others.
As Droṇa loved his brilliant student Arjuna, he taught
both his son and Arjuna alike the secrets. Seeing the
brilliance of Arjuna Droṇa ordered the cook not to seat
Arjuna in a dark place for meals. Yet it happened once
that the light was extinguished by wind while the prin-
ces were having their meals. All sat still, without eating,
while Arjuna alone ate his food. From this Arjuna
discovered that without seeing the object one could hit
the target by constant practice. Droṇa was greatly
pleased at this and embracing him promised to try to
make him such an expert that there would be none
equal to him in archery.
<div n="NI"/>{%(c) Ekalavya.%} Once Arjuna and the other disciples went
to the forest for a hunt and there they met Ekalavya
who was superior to Arjuna in archery. This Ekalavya
had once approached Droṇa to learn archery from him.
But it was against the rule for a Brahmin to teach a
forester the art of fighting. So Ekalavya returned to the
forest and making an earthen image of Droṇa worshipp-
ed it and began self-learning in archery. Now he had
become superior to Arjuna in archery. The teacher
had said that none would be equal to Arjuna in archery.
Arjuna told Droṇa about Ekalavya. The teacher went
to the forest and got the thumb of Ekalavya as the
reward due to the teacher. Since then Ekalavya became
a great archer though only of a lower level than Arjuna
(See under Ekalavya).
<div n="NI"/>{%d) Expert disciple.%} The education in archery and the
use of weapons was nearing completion. In archery
Arjuna was second to none. Duryodhana and Bhīma
[Page249-a+ 65]
became expert club-men. Aśvatthāmā was the first in
the secrets of archery. Nakula and Sahadeva became
expert swordsmen. Arjuna was expert in all branches of
weapon-training. Bhīma had bodily strength and Arjuna
had the strength of learning. Yudhiṣṭhira was the fore-
most in chariot-fighting.
<div n="NI"/>e) {%Artificial bird.%} Once Droṇa placed an artificial bird
on the branch of a tree without the knowledge of the
princes, to test their practice in archery. Then he
placed his disciples with their bows, around the tree,
and told them to shoot the bird down at his command.
Droṇa first called Dharmaputra and told him to look
at the bird. Then he asked him what he saw. Dharma-
putra said that he saw the bird, the tree, the teacher
and the students. He tested one by one. All gave the
same reply, that Dharmaputra gave. At last he asked
Arjuna. Arjuna stood for a while, taking aim and said
that he saw a bird only. The teacher commanded to
shoot and Arjuna sent an arrow. At the first shot the bird
fell down headless. With this test Droṇa understood that
Arjuna could defeat Drupada and embraced his
disciple.
<div n="NI"/>{%(f) Droṇa caught by a crocodile.%} Once Droṇa and his
disciples went to bathe in the Ganges. While they were
dipping and splashing in the water a crocodile caught
Droṇa by the leg. Droṇa was unable to extricate
himself from the grip of the crocodile. So he asked his
disciples to shoot the crocodile and kill it. All stood
agape. Arjuna at once took bow and arrows and sent
five arrows one after another at the crocodile, which
died instantly and came afloat. The teacher, who
was much pleased, got out of the water and embraced
Arjuna and taught him ‘Brahma Śirāstra’, a divine
weapon. After imparting this knowledge Droṇa told
Arjuna not to operate this weapon on man. But if an
enemy superior to man attacked him, then only, he
should send this missile at him to kill him.
<div n="NI"/>Giving due respect to the advice of the teacher, Arjuna
received the Brahmaśirāstra. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chap-
ter 133).
<div n="NI"/>g) {%Demonstration by the pupils.%} When the training of the prin-
ces terminated, Dhṛtarāṣṭra accorded sanction to hold a
demonstration of weapon-play, by the princes. An
arena was got ready. Droṇa entered the arena. As a
preliminary rite Droṇa worshipped the gods. Then he
invited Brāhmaṇas to bless his pupils. After that the
pupils gave the teacher, gold, precious stones, cloths,
and other costly things. The princes paid homage to
to their teacher. The teacher gave his blessings to
them. With this the demonstration commenced.
Clubbing between Duryodhana and Bhīma was a
terrible one. But the mock fighting changed to a seri-
ous fight. Droṇa sent Aśvatthāmā who separated them.
The audience applauded their performance. The per-
formance of Arjuna was of the most superior type and
the audience and the teacher were struck with wonder
at his extraordinary capability. Karṇa also showed
his performance. (For details see under Arjuna, Para 1
and Karṇa, Para 4). (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapters 133
and 134).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Revenge upon Drupada.%} When demonstration came to
an end it was the time for giving the teacher the gift
due to him. The teacher had, at the beginning, told
his pupils that on completion of the training they should
give him a gift. Accordingly he demanded that Drupada,
[Page249-b+ 65]
the King of Pāñcāla, should be brought before him with
his hands tied. As soon as Duryodhana and Karṇa heard
this they rapidly marched to Pāñcāla and engaged
Drupada in a fight but were defeated by Drupada. After
that Arjuna entered the battle-field, defeated and tied
Drupada and brought him before Droṇa who was kind
enough not to kill Drupada. The Kingdom of Pāñcāla
was divided into two. Drupada was given Uttara-Pāñ-
cāla and Droṇa took Dakṣiṇa Pāñcāla. Then Drupada
was released. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 137).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Arjuna is accorded sanction to fight with his teacher.%} One
year after the revenge on Drupada Yudhiṣṭhira was
anointed as heir-apparent, by Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Once, in
the council of the king, Droṇa called Arjuna to him and
said: “Oh, Arjuna! you must take an oath to do a parti-
cular thing in the presence of your relatives. If it happens
that I oppose you in battle you should fight against me
without thinking that I am your teacher. This oath is
your gift to your teacher.” Arjuna agreed and took the
oath in the presence of the people. Because there was such
an oath Arjuna's conscience did not prick him when he
had to fight against his teacher Droṇa in the battle of
Bhārata between the Pāṇḍavas and Kauravas. (M.B.
Ādi Parva, Chapter 139).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Part played by Droṇa up to the battle of Bhārata.%}
(1) Duryodhana and his party came to know only at
the time of the svayaṃvara (marriage) of Pāñcālī that
the Pāṇḍavas were not killed in the lac house burning.
When Arjuna won the test and got Pāñcālī, the Kaura-
vas became furious and began to plot against the
Pāṇḍavas. At that time Droṇa came to the council-hall
of the Kauravas and said that the Kauravas should go
to Pāñcāla and greet the Pāṇḍavas, bring them back
and give them half of the kingdom. (M.B. Ādi Parva,
Chapter 203).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Droṇa was present at the sacrifice of Rājasūya
(imperial consecration) performed by Yudhiṣṭhira.
(M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 34, Stanza 8).
<div n="NI"/>(3) When the game of dice was going on between
Śakuni and Yudhiṣṭhira Droṇa came with Dhṛtarāṣṭra
to the place to witness the game. (M.B. Sabhā Parva,
Chapter 60, Stanza 2).
<div n="NI"/>(4) Droṇa declared that the game of dice between
Śakuni and Yudhiṣṭhira was not fair (M.B. Vana
Parva, Chapter 9, Stanza 2).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Droṇa was well-versed in archery. (M.B. Vana
Parva, Chapter 37, Stanza 4).
<div n="NI"/>(6) While the Pāṇḍavas were living in the country of
Virāṭa, Arjuna in the guise of Bṛhannala, fought with the
Kauravas. Droṇa was the first to recognize Bṛhannala
as Arjuna at the sound of his conch. (M.B. Virāṭa
Parva, Chapter 46, Stanza 24).
<div n="NI"/>(7) In that fight Droṇa fought with Arjuna whose
arrows wounded Droṇa and he ran away from the
battlefield. (M.B. Virāṭa Parva, Chapter 58).
<div n="NI"/>(8) When Śrī Kṛṣṇa came to the council-hall of the
Kauravas to plead for a treaty on behalf of the Pāṇḍavas
who had returned after forest life and pseudonymity,
Droṇa took the side of the Pāṇḍavas and argued with
Duryodhana. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 126).
<div n="NI"/>(9) Droṇa advised Dhṛtarāṣṭra to see that a battle
between the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas was avoided.
(M.B. Udyoga Parva, two Chapters from 138).
<div n="NI"/>(10) When it was almost decided that the battle was
inevitable Droṇa boasted to Duryodhana that he would
[Page250-a+ 62]
annihilate the army of the Pāṇḍavas within a month.
(M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 193, Stanza 18).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Why Droṇa whose leaning was towards the Pāṇḍavas,%}
{%ṭook the side of the Kauravas in the battle of Bhārata.%} At
heart Droṇa was on the side of the Pāṇḍavas. But he
fought against them, taking the side of the Kauravas.
Even at that time he ardently wished the Pāṇḍavas to
win the battle. What is the reason for it? An answer to
this question is found in Mahābhārata, Bhīṣma Parva,
Chapter 43.
<div n="NI"/>The battle was about to begin. Dharmaputra went to
Droṇa and bowed before him and requested to bless
him so that he might win the battle against the Kaura-
vas. Droṇa said, “It is good on your part to have
come and seen me before the battle is begun. If you
had not seen me I would have cursed you to lose the
battle. But today I am honoured since you have come.
You fight the battle. Victory is yours. But I have to
stand with the Kauravas, and there is a reason for it.
Man is a slave of money and money is not the slave
of Man. The Kauravas have tied me with money. Śrī
Kṛṣṇa will be on the side of the righteous. Where Śrī
Kṛṣṇa is, there will be victory. But so long as I fight
it is difficult for you to win. So try to kill me at the
beginning of the battle. You need not feel sorry for
killing your teacher. Because when I shower arrows
and fight vehemently I won't look to see which enemy
has struck me down. Enemies could kill me only when
I am lying on darbha grass leaving fighting in dis-
appointment. I will put down my weapons in battle
only when I hear words which I dislike to hear.”
<div n="NI"/>After having revealed these secrets of his own he sent
Yudhiṣṭhira back. (M.B. Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 43).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Droṇa in the battle of Bhārata.%} (1) On the first day
