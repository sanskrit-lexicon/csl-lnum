JAYA¦ XIII. The original name of the Mahābhārata writ-
ten by Vyāsa, Many of the scholars are of opinion that
Vyāsa was not the author of the whole of the Mahā-
bhārata that we see in its present form now. They say
that the Bhārata written by Vyāsa consisted only of
eight thousand and eight hundred stanzas. That work was
named Jaya. To those eight thousand and eight hund-
red stanzas Vaiśampāyana added fifteen thousand, two
hundred stanzas and this great book was given the
name Bhārata or Bhārata saṃhitā (Bhārata collection).
When Sūta recited this book to other hermits in Naimi-
śāraṇya the book had a lakh of stanzas. Henceforward
the book was called Mahābhārata, (History of classical
Sanskrit Literature; Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter
62, Stanza 20).
