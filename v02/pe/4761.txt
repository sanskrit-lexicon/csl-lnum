NARAVĀHANA¦. A Kṣatriya King who had obtained
remission of the sin of Brahmahatyā (slaughter of
Brahmin) by taking the fast of Vaiśākhavrata.
<div n="NI"/>This man who was a Kṣatriya of Pāñcāla once
happened to kill a Brahmin with an arrow. To get
remission of this sin, he discarded his Sacred thread,
mark on the forehead and forelock and had been
wandering here and there when he met a Brahmin
named Muniśarmā. Naravāhana told him his story.
This Brāhmaṇa who was a lover of God advised him
regarding the importance of the Vaiśākha fast. By
taking this fast the King obtained remission of sin.
