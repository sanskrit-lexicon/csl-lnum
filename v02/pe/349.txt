Agnīdhra, Nābhi, Ṛṣabha, Antarīkṣa. Svāyambhuva
Manu had two sons, Uttānapāda and Priyavrata.
Dhruva was the son of Uttānapāda. Priyavrata married
Barhiṣmatī, and they had eleven children including
Agnīdhra. Agnīdhra married Pūrvacitti, a Deva wo-
man, and they became parents to nine sons, viz. Nābhi,
Kimpuruṣa, Hari, Ilāvṛta, Ramyaka, Hiraṇmaya,
Kuru, Bhadrāśva and Ketumāla. Nābhi wedded Meru-
devī, and to them were born 100 sons. The eldest son
was Bharata, after whom this country (India) is
named, i.e., Bhārata. Bhārata had 9 younger brothers,
namely Kuśāvarta, Ilāvarta, Brahmāvarta, Malaya,
Ketu, Bhadrasena, Indraspṛk, Vidarbha and Kīkaṭa.
<F>*) Rāmānuja's Bhāgavata (Malayalam) mentions one Āryāvarta also as Bharata's younger brother. But the name does not occur in the
original. (See Bhāgavata, Chapter 4, Verse 10.)</F>
<div n="NI"/>These brothers had nine younger brothers who were all
highly evolved yogīs. They were Kavi, Hari, Anta-
rīkṣa, Prabuddha, Pippalāyana, Āvirhotra, Dramiḍa,
Camasa and Karabhājana. (Bhāgavata, Pañcama
Skandha, Chapters 1-4).
