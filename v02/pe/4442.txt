MĀTALI¦. Charioteer of Indra. Chapter 69 of Vāmana
Purāṇa gives the following story about the birth of
Mātali.
<div n="NI"/>A child was born to sage Śamīka. It was the time
of Devāsura war. A great army of asuras under the
leadership of Andhaka attacked Devaloka and conquer-
ed it. In the great battle with Andhaka the Vajrā-
yudha of Indra broke into two. Indra was thinking of a
new weapon for him. Mahāviṣṇu then appeared before
him and advised him to praise the glory of Agni. Indra
did so and then a divine weapon rose from the fire.
Indra flew at the asuras carrying the new weapon.
There was no clever charioteer to drive the chariot of
Indra. Still, seated in the golden chariot given to
him by the Vasus Indra drove very swiftly against the
asuras. The earth shivered by the din of the chariot-
wheels.
<div n="NI"/>When the earth began to quake the sage Śamīka follow-
ing directions of his wife Tapasvinī placed the child
on the ground outside the hermitage. An astrologer had
told her that a child would become two if it was
placed in an open ground at the time of earth-quake.
Tapasvinī wanted one more child. As soon as her child
was placed on the ground another child identical in
every respect with the first one was born by the side of
the other. But the second child, as soon as it
[Page493-b+ 64]
was born rose up and ran to Indra for driving his
chariot.
<div n="NI"/>When the Gandharvas knew he was coming to help
Indra, they showered him with brilliance and the child
approaching Indra said “Oh, Lord of the Devas, I
shall be your charioteer.” Indra asked him, “Child,
whose son are you? How will you drive my horse? I
doubt your competence.” The child replied, “I am the
son born to Śamīka on the ground. I have been given
power and brilliance by the Gandharvas and so I am
capable of driving your chariot.” On hearing this, Indra
accepted him as his charioteer and named him Mātali.
