UPAYĀJA¦. Brother of the hermit Yāja. Both of them
lived on the banks of the Gaṅgā. Dhṛṣṭadyumna and
Pāñcālī were born to the King Drupada of Pāñcāla as
the fruit of the sacrifices performed by these hermits.
The story is given below:
<div n="NI"/>The famous teacher Droṇa was the son of the hermit
Bharadvāja, who was a friend of the King Pṛṣata of
Pāñcāla. So King Pṛṣata sent his son Drupada to the
hermitage of Bharadvāja for education. Thus Droṇa
and Drupada were fellow students.
<div n="NI"/>After completing his education Drupada became King
of Pāñcāla. At that time the teacher Droṇa once visited
the palace of the King. But Drupada did not duly
receive his former classmate. Droṇa got angry at this
and went to Hastināpura and became the teacher of the
Pāṇḍavas and the Kauravas. As a remuneration
for teaching them Droṇa demanded that Arjuna should
bind Drupada and bring him before him. Arjuna did
so. Drupada gave Droṇa a portion of his kingdom and
got his liberty. From that day onwards Drupada wished
for a son who would take revenge on Droṇa, and
requested the hermit Upayāja to perform a sacrifice for
getting a son. At first the hermit refused. The King
served the hermit for a year. The hermit was pleased
and asked the King to invite Yāja for the sacrifice. The
King did as he was told and Yāja and Upayāja came
to Pāñcāla and performed the sacrifice for getting a
son. From the sacrificial dais Dhṛṣṭadyumna and
Pāñcālī were born. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 166
and Sabhā Parva, Chapter 80, Stanza 45).
