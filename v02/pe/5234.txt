PRABHAÑJANA III¦. A Kṣatriya king. Once this king
killed a deer while it was breast-feeding its child and by
a curse of the mother-deer Prabhañjana had to live as
a tiger for a hundred years. When the period of the
curse was coming to an end, the tiger heard the advice
of a cow called Nandā and got himself transformed into
his original form of the king. (Chapter 18, Sṛṣṭi Khaṇḍa,
Padma Purāṇa).
