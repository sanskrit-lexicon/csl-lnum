ŚAKTI II¦. The weapon of Subrahmaṇya is called
Śakti, and it was made by Viśvakarman. Viśvakarman
once grilled Sūrya (sun) on his machine and reduced
his glow. The glow thus released by Viśvakarman fell
on the earth and Viśvakarman made with that glow
the cakra (disc) of Viṣṇu, the triśūla (trident) of Siva
the Puṣpaka, aerial chariot of Kubera and the Śakti of
Subrahmaṇya. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part 3, Chapter 2).
