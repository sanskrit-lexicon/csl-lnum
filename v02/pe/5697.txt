RATHAVĪTI¦. A maharṣi. He lived in a hilly region
very far away from the Himālayas. Once the maharṣi
called Śyāvāśva invited Rathavīti to perform a homa
at the yajña conducted by King Taranta, and when he
came for the homa with his daughter the father of Śyāvā-
śva asked him to marry his daughter to Śyāvāśva.
Rathavīti not only refused, but also dismissed Śyāvāśva
from the yājñic platform. At last Rathavīti married
[Page644-b+ 65]
his daughter to Śyāvāśva at the request of King
Taranta. (Ṛgveda, Sāyaṇabhāṣya).
