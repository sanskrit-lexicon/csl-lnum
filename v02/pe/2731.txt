ILĀ I¦. Daughter of Vaivasvata Manu.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu in this order:—
Brahmā—Marīci—Kaśyapa—Vaivasvata Manu—Ilā.
Vaivasvata Manu was the son of Kaśyapa by his wife
Aditi, and Ilā the daughter of Vaivasvata Manu by his
wife, Śraddhā. Ikṣvāku, the ancestral father of the solar
dynasty of Kings was brother of Ilā.
<div n="NI"/>2) Vaivasvata Manu and Śraddhā had, for a long
time no children. Manu got performed once by Agastya
a yajña to propitiate the Mitrāvaruṇas so that a son
might be born to him (Manu). Soon a daughter was
born to him and she was called Ilā. Then Manu
asked Vasiṣtha why a daughter was born to him
instead of a son for whom the yajña was performed by
Agastya. At once, Vasiṣtha by his will-power turned
the girl Ilā into a boy, and the boy was named Sud-
yumna. (Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Sudyumna again turned into woman.%} Once Śunaka
and some other sages went to the great forest Kumāra
Vana near Kailāsa to salute Sri Parameśvara ignorant
of the fact that just then Pārvatī and Parmeśvara were
enjoying themselves. The sudden appearance of Śunaka
and others was not relished by the divine couple, who
were then naked. They therefore, pronounced the curse
that anybody who entered the forest in future would be
turned into a woman. (Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>Sudyumna, now a young man, went for hunting one day.
Sudyumna who was ignorant of this curse entered this
forest with his friends while hunting. At once all of
them were transformed into women. Grief-stricken,
they stayed in the forest for some days, and then started
for the palace. Sudyumna bearing the name Ilā walked
at the head of the party as a beautiful woman. On the
way Budha met Ilā, they fell in love with each other
and got married. A son, Purūravas was born to Budha
by Ilā. (Bhāgavata).

<div n="NI"/>4) {%Transformation again;%} Ilā expressed to Vasiṣṭha, her
grief at having been turned into a woman, the sage
requested Śrī Parameśvara to restore her to her former
form as a man. Śiva said that Ilā would be a man and
a woman every alternate month, throughout life. Dur-
ing the month when she was a man he would engage
himself in matters of Government, and the next month,
when a woman, she would stay in the inner apartments
in the palace. Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 32 says
that Ikṣvāku, brother of Purūravas ruled the state till
the latter became a major. As soon as Purūravas
attained majority Sudyumna handed over to him the
reins of Government and retired to the forest for tapas,
and during this period he was taught the Navākṣara
mantra by sage Nārada. Sudyumna adored Devī with
this Mantra. She appeared to him and blessed him with
the state of salvation. (Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>Purūravas married Urvaśī, and ruled the country.
