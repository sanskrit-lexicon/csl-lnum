SUDARŚANA¦ XIV. (The Discus Sudarśana-weapon).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} The weapon of Mahāviṣṇu.
Two stories are seen about the origin of this weapon.
<div n="NI"/>(i) The sun married Saṃjñā the daughter of Viśva-
karmā. Saṃjñā complained to her father that she could
not bear the radiance of the Sun. Viśvakarmā put the
Sun in a turning machine and turned him and decreas-
ed his radiance. Out of the dust of the sun produced
by this process, Viśvakarmā made the discus-weapon,
the aerial chariot Puṣpaka, the Trident of Śiva, and
the Śakti (lance) of Subrahmaṇya. Of these weapons
the discus-weapon Sudarśana was given to Mahāviṣṇu.
This is one story. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 3, Chapter 2).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) During the burning of the forest Khāṇḍava, Indra
showered rain, against the fire. According to the second
story, the God Fire gave the discus weapon Sudarśana
to Śrī Kṛṣṇa and the Gāṇḍīva to Arjuna to fight
against Indra. (See the word Khāṇḍavadāha).
<div n="NI"/>Besides these two stories, several statements occur in
various Purāṇas, about this weapon Sudarśana. As
Sudarśana was in existence even before the incarnation
of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the story that Viśvakarmā made it, ought
to be given prominence. Very often Mahāviṣṇu used to
destroy enemies by this Sudarśana. Though Mahāviṣṇu
had taken several incarnations, only Śrī Kṛṣṇa is
mentioned in the Purāṇas as having used this weapon
Sudarśana very often.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The power of Sudarśana.%} Sudarśana flies up to the
ranks of the enemies, burning like fire. Once Mahā-
viṣṇu sent the weapon Sudarśana towards the asuras.
Then the havoc and destruction caused by this weapon,
is described as follows:
<div n="NI"/>The moment he thought of Sudarśana, to destroy the
power of the enemy, it made its appearance like the
Sun in the Solar region. It was a fearful sight. Emanat-
ing light and radiance from the blazing fire, the
Sudarśana rested on the hand of Viṣṇu; turning round
with a tremendous speed. Viṣṇu threw it at the
enemies with his powerful hand like that of the trunk
of an elephant, with a view to cleave the city of the
enemies into pieces. That weapon which was burning
in great flames like a great fire spreading radiance,
flew into the midst of the enemy's army and instantly
every one near it fell dead. Thus it flew about among
the asuras and burnt them to ashes. Then turning
round and round in the air it drank the blood shed
on the earth. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 19).
