HARIVAṂŚA¦(M). An appendix to the Mahābhārata
in 10,000 verses. The main object of it is to sing the
praises of Mahāviṣṇu. It contains three parts called
respectively Harivaṃśa Parva, Viṣṇu Parva, and Bha-
viṣya Parva. Creation of the world, kings of the solar
dynasty and of the lunar dynasty, Yadu dynasty and the
birth of Śrī Kṛṣṇa form the theme of Harivaṃśa Parva.
Viṣṇu Parva deals mainly with the pranks and games
of Śrī Kṛṣṇa in his childhood. Though there occur
certain hints about the future at the beginning of the
Bhaviṣya Parva, the creation of the world, the incar-
nation of Viṣṇu as Vāmana (Dwarf) and as Narasiṃha
(half man and half lion), Śiva and Viṣṇu constitute its
main theme.
<div n="NI"/>The following verses prove that the Harivaṃśa also was
composed by Vyāsa.
<Poem>Harivaṃśastataḥ parva-
purāṇaṃ khilasaṃjñitam /
Viṣṇuparvaśi śoścaryā
Visṇoḥkaṃsavadhastathā //
Bhaviṣyam parvacāpyuktaṃ
Khileṣvevādbhutaṃ mahat/
Etat parvaśatam pūrṇam
Vyāsenoktaṃ mahātmanā //</Poem>
(Ādi Parva, Chapter 2, Verses 83-84).
