SUDEVA IV¦. A famous King. Nābhāga married
Suprabhā the daughter of this King Sudeva. The
following is a story taken from Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa
stating how this Sudeva who was a Kṣatriya by birth,
became a Vaiśya by the curse of hermit Pramati.
<div n="NI"/>Once Nala, the friend of Sudeva, and the relative of
Dhūmrākṣa, after having drunk too much liquor, tried
to rape the wife of the hermit Pramati. All this happen-
ed while King Sudeva was standing silently near Nala.
Pramati requested King Sudeva repeatedly to save his
wife. Sudeva replied: ‘The Kṣatriya who could help
the needy, could save your wife also. But I am a
Vaiśya.” This arrogance of the King made the
hermit angry. “May you become a Vaiśya.”
The hermit cursed the King. Sudeva repented
and requested for liberation from the curse. “When a
Kṣatriya steals away your daughter you will recover
the lost feelings of Kṣatriya.” The hermit gave this
liberation from the curse.
<div n="NI"/>Because of this curse Nābhāga stole away Suprabhā
the daughter of Sudeva and Sudeva got back the lost
feelings of Kṣatriya.
