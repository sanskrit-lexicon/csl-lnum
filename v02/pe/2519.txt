GṚTSAMADA III¦. The son born to Indra of Mukundā.
There is the following story about him in Gaṇeśa
Purāṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Once when Rukmāṅgada was out from the palace,
Indra, in the guise of Rukmāṅgada, went to
Mukundā, wife of Rukmāṅgada, and slept with
her who was at that time sexually hungry. She delivered
a child in due course. This boy was Gṛtsamada. He
grew into a great scholar. Nobody was able to defeat
him in any verbal duel. Once Gṛtsamada went to the
palace of the king of Magadha to attend a Śrāddha (an
offering to the manes) along with Vasiṣṭha and others.
Atri Maharṣi who was present there then spoke sligh-
tingly of Gṛtsamada's parentage and Gṛtsamada coming
home questioned his mother. The mother then told him
what had happened and Gṛtsamada getting angry at the
immoral act committed by his mother cursed her and
said “May you be a Kaṇṭaka tree”. Mukundā also did
not leave her son free. She cursed him thus “You will
have a demon as your son”. But Gṛtsamada went and
did penance to propitiate Gaṇapati and got Brāhmaṇya.
