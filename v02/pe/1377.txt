CAKRA¦(Ṃ) I. Sudarśana Cakra (disc) of Mahāviṣṇu.
The Viṣṇu Purāṇa contains the following story about
the origin of the Cakra.
<div n="NI"/>Sūryadeva (the Sun God) married Saṃjñā, daughter
of Viśvakarmā. But, due to the insufferable heat of
her husband the marital life of Saṃjñā became miser-
[Page166-b+ 65]
able, and so she requested her father to lessen the heat
of Sūrya. And, accordingly Viśvakarmā ground Sūrya
on a grinding machine and thus diminished his efful-
gence. But, the grinding could diminish only (1/8) of
that effulgence, which glowing red-hot dropped on the
earth, and with that Viśvakarmā made the Sudarśana
Cakra, the Triśūla, the Puṣpakavimāna and the
weapon called Śakti. Out of those four things the
Triśūla came to be possessed by Śiva, the Puṣpaka-
vimāna by Kubera and Śakti by Brahmā. The Sudar-
śana Cakra which was glowing like anything was
deposited in the sea. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part 3, Chapter 2).
There is a story in the Mahābhārata as to how the
Cakra thrown into the sea came into the possession of
Mahāviṣṇu. While Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna were picnic-
ing on the shores of the Yamunā Agnideva went to
them and requested them to give Khāṇḍava forest to
him for food. As Takṣaka, friend of Indra, was living
in the forest the latter was causing heavy rains to fall
there. Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna realized the fact that Agni
would be able to consume the forest only after subjuga-
ting Indra. But, how to manage it? Then Agni said
that he would supply the weapon to fight Indra with,
and accordingly he meditated on Varuṇa, who pre-
sented to him (Agni) a chariot and flag with monkey
as symbol, a quiver which would never become empty
of arrows, a bow called Gāṇḍīva and the Sudarśana
Cakra. Agnideva gave the Cakra to Śrī Kṛṣṇa and the
other things to Arjuna. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter
297).
