DHARMAPUTRA¦. The eldest of the Pāṇḍavas, the
others being Bhīmasena, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} See under Arjuna.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Pāṇḍu, brother of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, had two wives,
Kuntī and Mādrī. There was a curse for Pāṇḍu that he
would die the moment he touched his wife. (See under
Pāṇḍu). Kuntī, the first wife of Pāṇḍu, had obtained
from Durvāsas five mantras. The mantras were very po-
tent. If she called upon any god reciting the mantra that
God would manifest himself to her and bless her with a
son. When Kuntī found that Gāndhārī was pregnant and
was about to deliver she became anxious and meditating
on Dharmadeva recited one of the mantras given by Dur-
vāsas and got a child from him. The boy was born at mid-
day on the eighth Jyeṣṭha day of the year on Pañcamī
and at the auspicious hour, Abhijit. At the time
of his birth there was a celestial voice which said “This
boy will become a very righteous and bold King, best
among the virtuous. He will be known as Yudhiṣṭhira”.
Obeying the dictate of the mysterious voice he was
named Yudhiṣṭhira. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 123).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Boyhood.%} When he had five sons Pāṇḍu went to the forest
of Śataśṛṅga together with his family to spend the spring
time there. The sages residing in that forest conducted
the christening ceremony of Dharmaputra. Kaśyapa,
priest of Vāsudeva, performed the Upanayana ceremony
(thread-wearing) of Dharmaputra (Chapter 123, Dākṣi-
ṇātyapāṭha) Ādi Parva, M.B.). Rājarṣi Śuka imparted
instructions to Dharmaputra on spear-warfare. Pāṇḍu
died during their stay there. Mādrī abandoned her life
by jumping into her husband's funeral pyre. Before
doing so she called Dharmaputra to her side and join-
ing her hands together said “Son, you are now the father
to your brothers.” When Pāṇḍu and Mādrī were dead
the sages of the forest took Kuntī and the children to
Hastināpura and entrusted them to the care of Bhīṣma
[Page227-a+ 65]
detailing to him all that had happened in the forest.
(Chapter 125, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Kaumāra (youth).%} Dharmaputra and his brothers spent
their boyhood in Hastināpura along with Duryodhana
and his brothers. Bhīmasena became a great foe of
Duryodhana and his brothers and Duryodhana always
nurtured a desire to kill Bhīmasena. Once Duryodhana
invited Dharmaputra and his brothers to have aquatic
games in the Gaṅgā. Accepting the invitation Dharma-
putra participated in the games along with his brothers.
One night Duryodhana caught hold of Bhīma alone and
tied him with ropes and threw him into the river. When in
the morning Dharmaputra found his brother missing he
ran to his mother to inform her of the loss. Kuntī asked
him to start a search and while he was on it Bhīmasena
appeared before him and told him how he was thrown
into the river by Duryodhana and how he went to
Nāgaloka and was brought to earth with great acquisi-
tions from there. Dharmaputra advised them not to
make the incident public. They received training in
warfare in Hastināpura under Droṇācārya. Dharmaputra
got great proficiency in chariot-fighting. As Gurudakṣiṇā
(fee for the preceptor) Dharmaputra agreed to bring
Drupada bound before the preceptor. But Arjuna stop-
ped him and himself undertook the task (Chapters 127
to 136, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Becomes heir-apparent and goes to the forest.%} Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
crowned Dharmaputra as the heir-apparent when the
latter had successfully completed his course of study in
warfare. By his good conduct, righteousness and adminis-
trative efficiency Dharmaputra excelled his father and be-
came very popular among his subjects. Jealous of this
Duryodhana decided to destroy the Pāṇḍavas somehow.
With the permission of his father, Duryodhana cons-
tructed a palace at Vāraṇāvata for the Pāṇḍavas to
reside there. That palace was built of Lākṣā (See
under Arakkillam). The entire population resented
this act of Duryodhana and rebuked him. They tried
to follow Dharmaputra to Vāraṇāvata and stay there.
But by tactful words he made them abandon that idea.
Still many brahmins followed Dharmaputra. After some
days Duryodhana set fire to the palace. But the Pāṇḍa-
vas escaped through a tunnel from the house which had
been constructed without the knowledge of Duryodhana
just at the time of construction of the building. Escap-
ing from there the Pāṇḍavas reached the forests and
travelling farther came to the shore of the Gaṅgā.
(Ślokas 138 to 148, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Story up to the life incognito.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) When the palace was burnt to ashes it was presumed
that they were dead and by the instructions of Dhṛtarā-
ṣṭra the funeral rites of the Pāṇḍavas were conducted
at Hastināpura. But Vidura informed Bhīṣma that the
Pāṇḍavas were alive. (Chapter 149, Dākṣiṇātyapāṭha,
Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Dharmaputra gave permission to Bhīma to marry
Hiḍiṃbā while they were in the forest. (Chapter 154,
Dākṣiṇātyapāṭha, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Dharmaputra counselled Arjuna to release Citraratha
Yakṣa who was defeated by Arjuna in a battle. (Śloka
39, Chapter 169, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(4) After the svayaṃvara of Pāñcālī, Dharmaputra
narrated to Drupada the story of their escape from
the palace. (Chapter 194, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(5) After svayaṃvara of Pāñcālī the Pāṇḍavas returned
[Page227-b+ 64]
to their country and Dharmaputra was crowned king
of half of the country. He started his rule at Khāṇḍava-
prastha, his capital. (Chapter 206, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(6) Nārada went to Khāṇḍavaprastha and advised them,
how to avoid unpleasantness accruing from their hav-
ing one wife in common. His advice was that Pāñcālī
should spend one year with each of the five in turn.
(Chapter 207, Ādi Parva).

<div n="NI"/>(10) When Śrī Kṛṣṇa went to Dvārakā from Indraprastha
Dharmaputra drove the chariot in the place of Dāruka,
charioteer of Kṛṣṇa. (Śloka 16, Chapter 2, Sabhā
Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(11) Mayāsura constructed a beautiful palace in
Indraprastha and gave it to Dharmaputra. (Śloka 37,
Chapter 3, Sabhā Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(12) Yudhiṣṭhira decided to perform a Rajasūya at Indra-
prastha. Even before the Rājasūya Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna
and Bhīmasena together killed Jarāsandha. After that
Yudhiṣṭhira sent Arjuna to the northern side and the
other brothers to the southern side for Digvijaya (con-
quest of countries). When he established his autocracy
he performed the Rājasūya. (Chapter 45, Sabhā
Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(13) Yudhiṣṭhira used to give free sumptuous food to
thousands of brahmins in golden pots daily. (Chapter 49,
Sabhā Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(14) Envious Duryodhana sent Vidura to bring Dharma-
putra to Hastināpura and defeated him foully in a game
of dice. Though Dharmaputra lost everything Dhṛtarā-
ṣṭra gave him back everything. (Chapter 72, Sabhā
Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>(15) Before Dharmaputra went back to his place, with the
permission of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Duryodhana called him back
again for another game of dice. Despite protests from
all sides Dharmaputra went again for a game of dice
with Duryodhana and lost again all he possessed. Then
he left the country with his brothers and wife to spend
twelve years in exile in the forests and another year
incognito. (Chapter 79, Sabhā Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(16) Sūrya gave the Akṣayapātra (a pot which is never
emptied) to the Pāṇḍavas. (Śloka 72, Chapter 3, Vana
Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(17) At first the Pāṇḍavas stayed in Dvaitavana and
later on the advice of Vyāsa they went to Kāmyakavana.
(Śloka 41, Chapter 36, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(18) He advised Bhīmasena to remain quiet for thirteen
years. (Chapter 52, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(19) Bṛhadaśva, the sage, narrated the story of Nala to
Dharmaputra while they were in the forest. (Chapter
43, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(20) The sage Lomaśa imparted instructions on philoso-
phy to Dharmaputra while they were in the forest.
(Chapter 94, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(21) Yudhiṣṭhira met and conversed with Paraśurāma
at the mountain Mahendra. (Chapter 117, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(22) The Pāṇḍavas then travelled in north India. On
their way to the mountain of Gandhamādana Pāñcālī
[Page228-a+ 64]
fainted and Yudhiṣṭhira wept bitterly. (Chapter 145,
Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(23) From Gandhamādana Dharmaputra with his wife
and brothers reached Badarikāśrama and from there
they returned to Dvaitavana.
<div n="NI"/>(24) When they went to Kāmyaka vana Śrī Kṛṣṇa visited
Dharmaputra there. (Chapter 153. Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(25) Duryodhana and his followers made a grand march
to Kāmyaka vana to see the Pāṇḍavas in sad plight
and there the Gandharva Citrasena bound them all by
ropes. Arjuna on the orders of Dharmaputra got them
all released. (Chapter 246, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(26) While the Pāṇḍavas were in exile in the forest
Duśśāsana went and invited Yudhiṣṭhira to attend a
Vaiṣṇava sacrifice conducted by Duryodhana. But
Dharmaputra sent him away saying that it was not
proper to come to the country before the expiry of the
period of exile. (Chapter 256, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(27) Yudhiṣṭhira received the sage Durvāsas with respect
and after offering homage sent him away contented.
(Chapter 262, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(28) Jayadratha kidnapped Pāñcālī and in the battle
that ensued Dharmaputra slew the King of Trigartta
but left free Jayadratha. (Chapter 272, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(29) At a time when Yudhiṣṭhira was plunged in sorrow
the sage Mārkaṇḍeya narrated the story of Śrī Rāma
to console him. (Chapters 273 to 291, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%How Dharmadava tested Yudhiṣṭhira.%} The Pāṇḍavas
travelling through the forests reached Dvaitavana. A
brahmin among their group was making fire by the
araṇi sticks when a deer rushed at him and took the
araṇi sticks away, carrying them on its horns. The
Pāṇḍavas ran after the deer and they travelled far
away from their place, still not getting scent of it. They
were all tired and thirsty. Yudhiṣṭhira directed
Nakula to climb on the top of a tree and investigate
whether there was any water anywhere nearby. Nakula
did so and reported that he could see a pond not far
from the place where they were sitting. Yudhiṣ-
ṭhira asked Nakula to go and fetch water. Nakula did
not return for a long time and Sahadeva was asked to
go and enquire. Sahadeva also did not return and
Arjuna was sent in search of them. When Arjuna did
not return Bhīmasena went to enquire. Bhīmasena also
did not return and finally Yudhiṣṭhira himself set out in
search of them. On reaching the pond Yudhiṣṭhira
was dumbfounded to see his brothers lying dead on
the banks of the pond. Weeping bitterly Yudhiṣṭhira
entered the pond and to his surprise he heard a voice
from the air addressed to him thus: “Ho, Yudhiṣṭhira,
I am a stork living on the small fishes of this pond.
This pond is my hereditary property. It was I who
killed your brothers. I will ask you certain questions.
If you answer them correctly you can drink from this
pond. If not, you will also die.
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—“I do not believe that you are simply
a bird. My brothers are renowned for their valour and
have defeated not only the devas, dānavas, gandharvas
and rākṣasas but also the four huge mountains like
Himālaya Pāriyātra, Vindhya and Malaya. I am eager
to know your true self who have slain such brave
brothers of mine.”
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—“I am a Yakṣa and not merely a bird. I
objected to your brothers' taking water from the pond.
[Page228-b+ 64]
But waving aside my objections they started taking
water from the pond and then I slew them. Now,
hear my questions: Who carries the Sun? Who are his
followers? Who makes the sun set? On whom does
the sun exist?”
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—It is Brahman who carries the Sun.
Devas are his followers. Dharma makes him set. He
exists on Satya.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—How does Mahāsiddhi come to he Śrotriyas?
(those who study the Vedas).
<div n="NI"/>Yudhiṣṭhira:—It happens by deep penance.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—What is the reason for a brahmin getting divi-
nity? What deed is equal to good conduct? What makes
a brahmin mortal and what makes him evil?
<div n="NI"/>Yudhiṣṭhira:—The Brahmin gets divinity by medita-
tion. Austerity is equal to good conduct. Death makes
a brahmin mortal and abusive words make him evil.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—What is the divinity of Kṣatriyas? What is
equal to good nature? What makes them mortal and
what makes them evil?
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—The divinity of a Kṣatriya is weapon.
Sacrifice is equal to good conduct. Fear makes him
mortal and non-sacrifice makes him evil.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—What is the best thing for agriculture? What
is the most important thing for agriculture? What are
the installations of the atmosphere and child-birth?
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—The best thing for agriculture is rain.
The important thing for agriculture is seed. The ins-
tallation of atmosphere is rays and that of child-birth
is child.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—Who is lifeless even though he breathes?
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—He who never offers oblations to a
deva, a guest or a servant is like the dead even though
he breathes.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—What is bigger than the earth? What is higher
than the sky? What is swifter than the wind? What
are greater in number than grass?
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—Mother is bigger than the earth.
Father is taller than the sky. Mind is swifter than the
wind. Thoughts are greater in number than grass.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—What is it that does not shut its eyes when
asleep? What is it that does not grow after birth? What
is heartless? What grows very quickly?
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—A fish does not shut its eyes when
asleep. An egg does not grow after its birth. A stone
is heartless. A river grows very quickly.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—Who is a friend to one who lives outside his
country? Who is a friend to a householder, to a patient
and to one dead?
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—For one who leaves his country the
friend he gets on his way is the best friend. To a house-
holder his wife is his friend, to a patient his doctor and
to one dead, charity.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—Who is a guest of all? What is Nectar? What
is spread throughout the world?
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—Agni (fire) is the guest of all. Moon
(Candra) is the nectar. Air is that which is spread
throughout the world.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—Who circles around solo? Who is born again?
What is the remedy for cold? What gives the maximum
yield?
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—The Sun circles solo. Candra is born
again. Fire is the remedy for cold. Earth gives the
maximum yield.
[Page229-a+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—What is the soul of Man? Who is the com-
panion given by God? What is Upajīvana?
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—The soul of Man is his son. The com-
panion given by God is wife. Cloud is Upajīvana.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—How do you become rich? How do you be-
come happy?
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—If you abandon lust you will be rich.
If you abandon desire you will be happy.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—By what is this world covered? By what does
the world become clear? By what does one lose his
friend? What is the obstacle for an entry into heaven?
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—Dullness covers the world. World
becomes clear by intelligence. A friend is lost by desire.
Domestic ties stand in the way of getting into heaven.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—Who are those equal to the dead? Which
country is dead?
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—A poor penniless man is equal to the
dead. The country where there is mob-rule is dead.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—Who is a pandit? Who is an atheist? Who is
wicked? What are lust and jealousy?
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—A righteous man is a pandit. An
atheist is wicked. Lust is the cause of worldly life.
Jealousy is the cause of worry.
<div n="NI"/>Yakṣa:—Though charity, wealth and lust are incom-
patible with each other when do they unite together?
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra:—When charity and wife compromise
the above three blend together harmoniously.
<div n="NI"/>The Yakṣa was highly pleased with the replies given by
Dharmaputra. He then offered to revive one of his bro-
thers and asked Dharmaputra to name whom he should
do so. Then Yudhiṣṭhira named Nakula. Yakṣa then
enquired why he had named Nakula leaving aside Arjuna
and Bhīma. Dharmaputra replied that though Kuntī
and Mādrī were two wives of Pāṇḍu they were both
mothers to them and so he wanted to see one of the
sons of Mādrī alive. He therefore pressed the name of
Nakula again. The Yakṣa who was none other than
Dharmadeva was immensely happy to hear that reply
and gave life to all his brothers. He confessed to
Yudhiṣṭhira that it was he who in the form of a deer
came and ran away with the araṇi sticks. He returned
the araṇi sticks also. Dharmadeva then advised them
to go and spend their life incognito at the court of King
Virāṭa blessing them with the assurance that they
would never be found out during their life in disguise.
Dharmadeva disappeared after this and the Pāṇḍavas
returned to their āśrama. (Chapters 312 and 313 of
Vana Parva, M.B.).

(Chapter 107 to 115, Bhīṣma Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(17) In the meantime Droṇācārya made a vow that he

<div n="NI"/>(27) Once Yudhiṣṭhira scolded Arjuna and the latter

fight. (Śloka 18, Chapter 61, Śalya Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(32) When Yudhiṣṭhira won the war he sent Śrī Kṛṣṇa
to Hastināpura to console Gāndhārī. (Śloka 40, Chap-
ter 62, Śalya Parva).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Yudhiṣṭhira is crowned King.%} When Yudhiṣṭhira won
the war he sent Nakula to bring Pāñcālī. He went
round the Kurukṣetra battle ground and saw his own
kith and kin lying dead and the sight made him faint.
After that he went to Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Gāndhārī cursed
him for killing her sons. Gāndhārī gave a piercing
look at the nails on the foot of Dharmaputra when he
stood before Gāndhārī bowing down, Instantly the
nails turned black. Yudhiṣṭhira gave Dhṛtarāṣṭra the
names of all the prominent persons who were killed in
the war Dhṛtarāṣṭra ordered Yudhiṣṭhira to perform the
obsequies of the dead. It was at this stage that Yudhiṣṭhira
came to know from Kuntī that Karṇa was his brother.
Yudhiṣṭhira wept bitterly when he knew the secret from
his mother and cursed womankind as a whole stating
that woman would thereafter be incapable of keeping a
secret to herself. The news of the death of Karṇa gave
a sudden mental turn-back to Yudhiṣṭhira and he
decided to renounce all and go to the forest. He
called aside his followers and announced his decision to
them. At that time Vyāsa came there and preached to
him about the perishable nature of life. Yudhiṣṭhira
then asked him what he should do for the atonement
of the sins committed. Though he strongly desired to
go to the forest Vyāsa and Śrī Kṛṣṇa did not allow him
to do so and sent them all to Hastināpura. When the
Pāṇḍavas entered the city the people gave them a
rousing reception and Yudhiṣṭhira was crowned King.
(Chapters 10 to 17 of Sauptika Parva, Chapters 12 to
27 Strī Parva, Chapters 1 to 40 Śānti Parva).
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Administration.%} When Yudhiṣṭhira became King,
with the permission of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, he distributed the
various administrative responsibilities among his bro-
thers. He took for himself the task of taking care of
their kith and kin and friends. He gave many gifts to
the brahmins and other dependants. He once went to
Śrī Kṛṣṇa to express his gratitude for him. He visited
Bhīṣma lying on his bed of arrows accompanied by
Śrī Kṛṣṇa and his brothers. Bhīṣma revealed to him
the inner import of Rājadharma, Āpaddharma and
Mokṣadharma. Receiving the blessings of Bhīṣma
Yudhiṣṭhira and his brothers returned to Hastināpura.
Yudhiṣṭhira went to the Himālayas to get riches from
Marutta before performing an Aśvamedha Sacrifice.
While on his way to the Himālayas he fasted for a night
and worshipped Śiva. People like Vyāsa and Śrī Kṛṣṇa
partook in the sacrifice. After the sacrifice was over
Dhṛtarāṣṭra desired to go to forest and sought the
approval of Yudhiṣṭhira to do so. On hearing that
Yudhiṣṭhira wept. But on the advice of Vyāsa he gave his
approval for Dhṛtarāṣṭra to go to forest. Dhṛtarāṣṭra
appealed to him through Vidura for funds to perform the
obsequies of the dead. Bhīma objected to this but
[Page230-b+ 65]
Yudhiṣṭhira reprimanded him and silenced him and
gave Dhṛtarāṣṭra enough funds for his purposes. Kuntī
and Gāndhārī accompanied Dhṛtarāṣṭra to the forest.
Yudhiṣṭhira accompanied by Pāñcālī and Sahadeva
went and saw them in the forests after a few days.
(Chapters 41 to 55, Śānti Parva, Chapters 92 from
Anuśāsana Parva and Aśvamedha Parva and Chapter
26 from Āśramavāsika Parva).
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Vidura merges into Dharmaputra.%} When Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
Gāndhārī and Kuntī went to forest Vidura also accepted
sannyāsa and left for the forest. There sitting under a
tree he started doing penance. After a few days Yudhi-
ṣṭhira came to the forest to see his mother and others.
After spending some time with Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Gāndhārī
and Kuntī he went to the place where Vidura was
doing penance. Vidura started running the moment he
set eyes on Yudhiṣṭhira and the latter ran after him.
After some time Vidura turned back and stood staring
at Yudhiṣṭhira. At that time the soul of Vidura escap-
ing from his body merged with that of Yudhiṣṭhira.
The body of Vidura stood stiff and leaned against a tree.
Taking him to be dead Yudhiṣṭhira started to do the
funeral rites and then there resounded a voice from
heaven saying that Vidura was not dead. The unknown
voice was from Dharmadeva. When the voice subsided
Vidura became his old self again. Yudhiṣṭhira went
back. (Chapter 26, Āśramavāsika Parva).
<div n="NI"/>13) {%The end of Dharmaputra.%} Soon after his return from
the forest Nārada came to Hastināpura and told him of
the death of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Kuntī and Gāndhārī in a
wild fire in the forest. Lamenting deeply Yudhiṣṭhira
performed the obsequies at Hastināpura. It was at
this time that the Yādava dynasty perished and Dvārakā
was sunk into the ocean. The Pāṇḍavas then crowned
Parīkṣit as their successor and entrusted Yuyutsu with
the administration of the State till Parīkṣit came of age.
Vajra was appointed as chief of Indraprastha. The
obsequies of Vāsudeva, Balarāma and Kṛṣṇa were per-
formed at Hastināpura. Kṛpācārya was appointed as
preceptor to Parīkṣit. After having made all such
arrangements the Pāṇḍavas commenced their Mahāpras-
thāna. The five Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālī started from
Hastināpura. A dog also followed them. Yudhiṣṭhira
walked ahead. On the way, one by one, Pāñcālī Saha-
deva, Nakula, Arjuna and Bhīmasena fell dead. Alone
with a dog to keep company, Yudhiṣṭhira reached a
plateau on the top of the Himālayas and there Indra
was waiting for him with a chariot. But Yudhiṣṭhira
said that he would not come to heaven without his
wife and brothers. He was then informed that they had
already reached heaven. Yudhiṣṭhira insisted that the
dog also should be taken to heaven which Indra
blankly refused. But Yudhiṣṭhira refused to ascend the
chariot without the dog which, he said, had given him
company from the start to the finish. The dog then
changed itself into Dharmadeva and he complimented
him on his sense of justice. When Yudhiṣṭhira entered
heaven he saw Duryodhana sitting in all luxury and glory.
Yudhiṣṭhira did not like it but Nārada pacified him.
Yudhiṣṭhira saw all his relatives sitting there. A devadūta
took him round hell also. When he heard the pitiable
groans from there Yudhiṣṭhira thought his right place
was with them. But Indra and Dharmadeva again con-
soled him. He was given a bath in Ākāśagaṅgā. He then
lost his mortal form and his soul entered Divyaloka.
[Page231-a+ 64]
Standing in the form of Dharmadeva he saw all his
relatives including Kṛṣṇa. (Chapters 38 and 39,
Āśramavāsika Parva, Chapter 1, Mausala Parva;
Mahāprasthānika Parva, Svargārohaṇa Parva).
