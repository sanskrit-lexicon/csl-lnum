VĀYU I¦. One of the eight guardians of the world.
(Dikpālakas).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Vāyu was born from the breath
of Viśvapuruṣa. (Ṛgveda 10, 90). Tvaṣṭā was the son
in-law of Vāyu. The eight dikpālakas are Indra, Vahni
(Fire), Yama, Nirṛti, Varuṇa, Vāyu, Kubera and Śiva.
Vāyu is the guardian of the North West zone. The
palace of Bhagavān Vāyu is known as Gandhavatī.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Confrontation with Vāsuki.%} Once Vāyu and Vāsuki
tried to find out who of the two was mightier, in con-
sequence of which, Trikūṭaparvata, a peak of Mount
[Page841-a+ 64]
Himālaya, was broken from its bed and thrown into
the southern ocean near Laṅkā. Later, the city of
Laṅkā was built on this mountain. (For details see
under Trikūṭa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Children.%} Bhīmasena and Hanūmān are said to be
the prominent sons of Bhagavān Vāyu. It is mentioned
in Ṛgveda, Maṇḍala 1, Anuvāka 7, Sūkta 112, that
Agni was the son of Vāyu. To make fire from wood by
attrition, the hands obtain strength by the help of the
life breath called Vyāna (a breath or vāyu). It is from
this, that the idea that fire is the son of Vāyu, came in-
to existence. To know how Vāyu obtained the paternity
of Bhīma and Hanūmān see under Bhīma and Hanūmān.
It is stated in Brahma Purāṇa that a group of celestial
maids called ‘Mudā’ owes its origin to Vāyu.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Love of Vāyu.%} Once Bhagavān Vāyu happened to see
the six beautiful daughters of Kuśanābha, a king, and
he was excited sexually. As the princesses refused to
satisfy his desire, Vāyu changed the damsels into hunch-
backs, by a curse. (For detailed story see under Kuśa-
nābha).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The Vāyus (breaths) in the body.%} (See under Nāḍīcakra).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Curbing the arrogance of Silk-cotton tree.%} Long ago a
silk-cotton tree grew up on the top of the Himālayas.
It grew up to be a big tree spreading its branches in
all directions. Birds built their nests on the branches of
that big tree and hermits and animals found shelter
under its shade. The silk-cotton tree became arrogant.
Once Nārada came there and praised the tree:—“How
gigantic, this silk-cotton tree is! Even in a great storm
its branches do not move.” The praise of Nārada made
the tree more haughty. It told Nārada that the storm
etc. were its servants. Nārada told Vāyu, what the
silk-cotton tree said to him. Vāyu got angry and com-
ing to the tree, said thus:- “You, wicked silk-cotton
tree, in days of yore, when Brahmā was carrying on
creation he took rest on you for a while. That is why I
keep motionless when I come to you. It is not because
I am afraid of you. I knew that you belittled me before
Nārada. If you are bold enough, come and fight with
me.”
<div n="NI"/>The silk-cotton tree accepted the challenge. Next day
Bhagavān Vāyu changed into a storm and blew against
the tree. The tree lost leaves, flowers and fruits and
stood bare. Thus within a very short time the arrogance
of the tree was curbed.
<div n="NI"/>This story was told to Yudhiṣṭhira by Bhīṣma, to show
that rendering help to a foe, will only make him
haughty. (M.B. Śānti Parva, 3 Chapters from 154).
<div n="NI"/>{%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) When Indra cut off the wings of the mountains,
Bhagavān Vāyu saved the mountain Maināka from this
danger, by hiding it in the ocean. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
Sundara Kāṇḍa, Sarga 1, Stanza 126).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) The image of Bhagavān Vāyu should be consecrated
as sitting on the haunch of a deer, holding a flag. (Agni
Purāṇa, Chapter 51).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Indra sent Vāyu also along with Menakā to hinder
the penance of Viśvāmitra. While Menakā was dancing
in front of Viśvāmitra, Vāyu displaced her cloth. (M.B.
Ādi Parva, Chapter 72, Stanza 1).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) It is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Vana Parva,
Chapter 19, Stanza 22, that Vāyu is the messenger of
the gods.

a priest. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 72, Stanzas 10-25).

Parva, Chapter 128).

of Brahmins to Kārtavīryārjuna. (M.B. Anuśāsana
