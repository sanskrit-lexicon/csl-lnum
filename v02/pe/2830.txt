JALANDHARA¦. A mightly and valiant Asura. Khaḍga-
romā was his charioteer and Vṛndā was his wife.
Jalandhara was the grandson of the sea of Milk. Once
he met with the headless Rāhu, who said to Jalandha-
ra, the whole story beginning from the churning of the
sea of Milk. Jalandhara, became furious at the gods who
had churned his grandfather. So he collected a big
army of asuras and went to war with the devas. Though
a large number of Asuras were killed in the battle,
Indra and Viṣṇu were defeated and Viṣṇu was taken
captive and hidden under the sea. Finally Paramaśiva
went to fight with the Asura. In the fight Jalandhara
was killed and Viṣṇu was rescued. (Padma Purāṇa,
Chapters 3 to 5). For further details see under Māyā-
śiva.
