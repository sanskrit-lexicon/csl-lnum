ṚTUKĀLA¦. The time that is most auspicious for sexual
intercourse for a woman with her husband. In ancient
India certain days were prescribed as the best period for
women to become pregnant. This period is called
Ṛtukāla. (Ṛtu—Menstruation. Kāla—time, period.)
<div n="NI"/>The sixteen days following menstruation are supposed
to be good; but the first three days are not very good
and it is advisable not to have sexual intercourse during
those days. The next even days beginning with the
fourth day (4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th and 16th)
are the best days for coitus if a male issue (a son) is
desired. The odd days (5th, 7th, 9th, 11th 13th, 15th)
are to be preferred if a female issue (daughter) is desired.
(Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 151).
