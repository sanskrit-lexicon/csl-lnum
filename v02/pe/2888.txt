<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Jarāsandha was created by joining together
two halves of a child, by a giantess called Jarā, and so
this child got the name Jarāsandha. (For detailed story
see under Jarā).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The first battle with Śrī Kṛṣṇa.%} Asti and Prāpti, the
two wives of Kaṃsa, were daughters of Jarāsandha.
When Śrī Kṛṣṇa killed Kaṃsa, the two daughters
went to their father and shed tears before him. Jarā-
sandha became angry and with a mighty army sur-
rounded the city of Mathurā. A fierce battle was
fought between Jarāsandha and Kṛṣṇa. At last Bala-
bhadrarāma caught hold of Jarāsandha and was
about to kill him, when an ethereal voice said that
Balabhadrarāma was not the person to kill Jarāsandha.
Accordingly Rāma and Kṛṣṇa set Jarāsandha free.
(Bhāgavata, Skandha 10).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other information.%}

<div n="NI"/>(3) Mention is made in Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva,

Svayaṃvara (marriage) of Pāñcālī.
<div n="NI"/>(4) Once there arose a battle between Jarāsandha
and Kaṛṇa, in which Jarāsandha was defeated and so
he made a treaty with Karṇa. (M.B. Śānti Parva,
Chapter 5, Stanza 6).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The death of Jarāsandha.%} The enmity between Śrī
Kṛṣṇa and Jarāsandha was life-long. These two mighty
powers confronted each other eighteen times. Śrī Kṛṣṇa
decided to kill Jarāsandha, the King of Magadha,
in a duel. Once Śrī Kṛṣṇa with Arjuna and Bhīma,
reached the city of Magadha in the guise of Brāh-
maṇas. They started from the kingdom of Kuru
[Page350-a+ 64]
travelled through Kurujāṅgala and passed by
Padmasaras and Kālakūṭa, visited the holy. places of
Gaṇḍakī, Mahāśoṇā, Sadānīrā and such others, crossed
the river Sarayū and reached the opposite bank. Then
they travelled through the countries of East Kosala
and Mithilā. Touring through the countries they
crossed the rivers Carmaṇvatī, Gaṅgā and Śoṇa. Wear-
ing matted hair and barks of trees they reached Giri-
vraja, the capital city of Magadha. There were three
big drums, which were used only on special occasions.
The hide of elephant was used for making them.
<F>1. See under Bṛhadratha IV to know about the sound of this big drum.</F> Seeing
all these sights they reached the presence of Jarāsandha,
who welcomed them with necessary formalities and
talked with them. But they kept silence. At last Śrī
Kṛṣṇa told him that his two friends were having the
vow of silence, which would terminate only at mid-
night. So the King left them in the sacrificial hall and
went to the palace. He came to them at midnight and
asked them who they were. Śrī Kṛṣha revealed to him
that they were Kṛṣṇa, Bhīma and Arjuna, who had
come to fight a duel with Jarāsandha, who had unrea-
sonably put many innocent Kings in dungeon, and
challenged him to select any one of them for duel. Jarā-
sandha, trembling with fury, selected Bhīma. In that
duel Jarāsandha was killed. (M.B. Sabhā Parva,
3 Chapters from 20).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Names given to Jarāsandha.%} Bārhadratha, Māgadha,
Magadhādhipa and Jarāputra are some of the names
used in the Mahābhārata by Vyāsa as synonyms of
