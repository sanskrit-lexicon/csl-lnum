TORAṆASPHĀṬIKA¦. Duryodhana decided to make
the Pāṇḍavas beggars by defeating them in a false game
of dice. Dhṛtarā ṭra stood as an accomplice to that.
To play the game Dhṛtarāṣṭra constructed a palace
and that palace was called Toraṇasph ṭika.
<div n="NI"/>That diamond-studded palace had a thousand pillars and
a hundred entrances. It had crystal fortresses and
golden thrones in all the chambers. This palace was
called Dyūtabhavana also. (Chapter 56, Sabhā Parva).
