VIŚĀKHA I¦. One of the three brothers of Skanda-
deva. The other two were Śākha and Naigameya.
There is a story regarding them in Mahābhārata, Śānti
Parva, as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Skandadeva approached his father Śiva. At that
time Śiva, Pārvatī, Agni and Gaṅgā, all wished
in their minds that Skanda should come to him or her.
Understanding the desire of each, by Yogabala (the
power obtained by union with the Universal Soul)
Skanda divided himself into four persons, Skanda,
Viśākha, Śākha and Naigameya and went to each of
them respectively and fulfilled their desire. (For
further details see under Subrahmaṇya).
