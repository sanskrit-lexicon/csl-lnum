DHANVANTARI I¦. A deva who was a preceptor in
Āyurveda.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin.%} The devas and asuras together churned the
milky ocean, Kṣīrābdhi, to salvage Amṛta (Nectar) from
it. After thousand years there arose from the ocean a
deva with a Kamaṇḍalu (water-pot of ascetics) in one
hand and a daṇḍa in the other. That deva was Dhan-
vantari, (Śloka 31, Sarga 45, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki
Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>The birth of Dhanvantari from the ocean of Milk is
described in Chapter 29 of Harivaṃśa thus:
<div n="NI"/>Prosperous-looking Dhanvantari rising above the water-
level of Kṣīrābdhi stood worshipping Mahāviṣṇu. Viṣṇu
gave him the name of Abja. Dhanvantari is thus known
by the name of Abja also. Dhanvantari bowing to
Viṣṇu said “Prabho, I am your son. Allot to me
yajñabhāga”.
<div n="NI"/>Vtṣṇu replied thus: “Portions of yajña have already
been allotted. Because you were born after the devas
you cannot be considered as one among them. You will
be born again in the world for a second time and then you
will be a celebrity. In your second life even from while
in the womb you will have knowledge of Aṇimā and
Garimā. Therefore you will be born as a deva incar-
nate. You will write in eight divisions a book on
Āyurveda; your second life will be in Dvāpara yuga.”
After having said so much Viṣṇu disappeared.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Rebirth of Dhanvantari.%} Suhotra, King of Kāśi, in
the second Dvāpara yuga had two sons, Śala and Gṛtsa-
mada. Śunaka was the son of Gṛtsamada. Śala got a son,
Ārṣṭiṣeṇa. Kāśa was born to Ārṣṭiṣeṇa. To Kāśa was
born Dīrghatapas (Dhanvā). For a long time Dhanvā
did not have any children and so he went and did
penance to propitiate Abjadeva. Abjadeva (Dhanvan-
tari) was pleased and was born as a son to Dhanvā.
Dhanvā named the boy as Dhanvantari and the latter
taught his disciples Āyurveda, by parts, eight in num-
ber. From Dhanvantari in order were born Ketumān—
Bhīmaratha—Divodāsa. (Chapter 29, Harivaṃśa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Dhanvantari and Parikṣit.%} There is a story in the
purāṇas that when Takṣaka went and bit Parīkṣit to
kill him, a Viṣahāri (one who cures those infected with
snake venom) rushed to save the king but was bribed
and sent back by Takṣaka. There are indications in
the Purāṇas to show that the Viṣahāri under reference
was Dhanvantari though it is stated that Kaśyapa was
the person involved. (See under Takṣaka).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Dhanvantari and Manasādevī.%} In the Kṛṣṇajanma
[Page223-b+ 65]
Khaṇḍa of Brahmavaivarta Purāṇa there is a story
connecting Dhanvantari with Manasādevī, a serpent-
goddess.
<div n="NI"/>Once Dhanvantari with his disciples was going to Kailāsa.
On the way Takṣaka made a venom-spitting hiss. At
once one of the disciples of Dhanvantari boldly went
and plucked the diamond on the head of Takṣaka and
threw it to the ground. Hearing this Vāsuki, King of
serpents, sent to Dhanvantari thousands of serpents
under the leadership of Droṇa, Puṇḍarīka and Dhanañ-
jaya. The poisonous breath of all these serpents joined
together made the disciples of Dhanvantari swoon.
Immediately Dhanvantari by a medicine made from
vanaspati made all his disciples recover and then sent
all the serpents to a swoon. When Vāsuki heard this
he sent the serpent-maid, Manasādevī, a disciple of
Śiva, to face Dhanvantari. Manasādevī and Gaḍūra
were both disciples of Śiva. But Dhanvantari was a
follower of Gaḍūra. Manasādevī made all the disciples
of Dhanvantari swoon but the latter because of his great
proficiency is Viṣavidyā soon brought back his disciples
to normal. When Manasādevī found that it was impos-
sible to defeat Dhanvantari or his disciples by using
poison Manasādevī took the triśūla given to her by Śiva
and aimed it at Dhanvantari. Seeing this Śiva and
Brahmā appeared before them and pacifying them sent
them all their way.
