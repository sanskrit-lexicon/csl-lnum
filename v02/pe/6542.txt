SĀVITRĪ IV¦. The wife of Satyavān.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} In the country of Madra, famous in the
Purāṇas, there was a king named Aśvapati. His wife was
Mālatī. Though the couple grew old they were child-
less. At last they worshipped Devī Sāvitrī. After vows
and prayers for eighteen years the Devī appeared before
them, and giving them the boon that a daughter would
be born to them, she disappeared. The couple returned
to the palace and Mālatī conceived and delivered a
daughter whom they named Sāvitrī. (Skandha 9, Devī
Bhāgavata; Mahābhārata, Vana Parva, Chapter 293).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Marriage.%} Sāvitrī grew up as though Lakṣmī had
taken an incarnation and bloomed into a beautiful
damsel. But nobody came forward to marry her. On
a New moon day she bathed and purified herself and
getting the blessings of Brahmins, came and bowed
before her father. The King felt sorry as nobody had
offered to marry her though she was in the full bloom of
youth. He advised her to travel in the outside world
and to select a husband by herself. According to the
order of her father she took the aged ministers of the
King and travelled through the forests in which hermits
lived.
<div n="NI"/>Once Nārada came to the palace and while he was
talking with King Aśvapati, Sāvitrī and the aged
ministers returned. She bowed before her father and
Nārada. As soon as Nārada saw her, he asked with
curiosity about her marriage. The father replied that he
had sent her in search of a husband. Sāvitrī said “I have
accepted the Prince Satyavān as my husband. He is
the son of King Dyumatsena of Sālva. Dyumatsena
became blind in his old age, and taking this opportunity
his enemies captured his country. Dyumatsena with
his wife and son went to the forest and lived there.”
<div n="NI"/>Nārada described the qualities of Satyavān. “Satyavān
is as radiant as the sun, as intelligent as Bṛhaspati,
as valiant as Indra and as patient as the Earth.
Aśvapati was immensely pleased at hearing about the
good qualities of Satyavān, and asked Nārada, if
there was anything to say against him. Nārada said
that he had nothing to say against Satyavān except
that he would die “within one year from this date.”
(Mahābhārata, Vana Parva, Chapter 294).
<div n="NI"/>The King felt miserable when he heard this. Sāvitrī
said that she had accepted Satyavān as her husband
and that nothing could make her waver from her
decision even if he is not going to live more than a
year. The King agreed to the wish of his daughter and
preparations for the marriage were begun. The King
went with Sāvitrī to the forest and saw Dyumatsena
[Page713-b+ 63]
who gladly consented to the marriage. Aśvapati return-
ed to the palace leaving Sāvitrī with Satyavān and his
parents. As soon as Aśvapati had returned, Sāvitrī dis-
carded her ornaments and assumed the dress suitable
to life in the forest and lived with them.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The death of Satyavān.%} It was nearly a year and the day
of death of Satyavān was fast approaching. There were
only four days more. Sāvitrī had taken a vow lasting
for three days. Dyumatsena dissuaded her from taking
fast. She completed the fast. There was left only one
night more. She kept awake for the whole night.
Morning came. Though she ended her fast she had not
taken any food. Dyumatsena wanted to know the
reason. She humbly said that she would eat only after
sun-set.
<div n="NI"/>As usual Satyavān took his axe and started for the wood.
Sāvitrī also followed him.
<div n="NI"/>Satyavān:-“You have never accompanied me before.
Moreover you are very weak on account of the fast.
Then how can you come with me?”
<div n="NI"/>Sāvitrī: “I am not at all weak by the fast and vow. I
want to come with you. I pray, don't hinder me.”
<div n="NI"/>At last Satyavān consented after getting the permission of
his parents. Both went to the forest to gather fruits and
roots. They gathered fruits and roots. Then Satyavān began
to cut wood. By that exertion Satyavān sweated all over.
He was affected by headache. “Let me lie down!” He said.
The axe fell from his hand. Sāvitrī caught her husband
who was falling down and laid him on her lap. Sāvitrī
saw a person clad in blood-coloured garments, with red
eyes and a rope in hand, coming towards them. He
came to the spot and stood there looking at the body of
Satyavān. Realizing the person to be Kāla (Deathgod)
Sāvitrī stood up instantly and bowed before him.
<div n="NI"/>Sāvitrī:—“Who are you Lord. What may be your
object in coming here?”
<div n="NI"/>Yama:—Hei, Sāvitrī. As you are a hermitess of chas-
tity I may converse with you. I am Yama. I am come to
take away the life of your husband.”
<div n="NI"/>Sāvitrī:—“Lord, I have heard that your messengers
come and take away the souls. How is it that you have
come in person today?”
<div n="NI"/>Yama:—This Satyavān is a righteous man who is an
ocean of good qualities. Messengers are not sent, in the
cases of persons like him.”
<div n="NI"/>Saying thus Yama cast his rope and caught the soul of
Satyavān. Sāvitrī saw the body of her husband lying
without life and soul. Sāvitrī followed Yama who had
gone to the south with the soul of Satyavān.
<div n="NI"/>Yama:—Child, you go back and conduct his funerals.
You have followed your husband as far as you can.
<div n="NI"/>Sāvitrī:—I am coming to the place where my husband
is being taken. That is the duty of a wife. What im-
pediment is there on my way to follow you, when I
have the merits of vow, fast, devotion to my elders, love
and regard for my husband and the good will of your-
self, my Lord.”
<div n="NI"/>When Yama realized that it was difficult to send
Sāvitrī back, he asked Sāvitrī to ask for any boon. Yama
was prepared to give anything except the life of Satya-
vān. She requested for the recovery of sight by Dyumat-
sena. Yama granted it. Still Sāvitrī did not turn back.
Yama asked her to pray for one more boon. She
[Page714-a+ 65]
requested for the recovery of the lost kingdom of Dyu-
matsena. Yama sanctioned that request also. Still she
followed Yama, who was ready to grant her a third
boon. She requested: “My father may, please be given
a hundred sons who would continue the family. Yama
granted that too. But she did not turn back. Yama
told her that she might ask for a fourth boon. She said:
“I may be given a hundred sons born directly from
Satyavān. Yama granted this fourth boon also. Then
Sāvitrī asked Yama how the boon would be realized
unless the life of Satyavān was given back to him.
Yama was pleased with her at her love and devotion
for her husband and returned the life of Satya-
vān. Yama blessed her that she and Satyavān would
live for hundred years.
<div n="NI"/>Yama disappeared. Sāvitrī returned and sat there
taking the body of Satyavān on her lap. Satyavān
came to life. Both of them rose up. Night came on. It
was dark. They could not find the way. Satyavān
wanted to reach their hermitage somehow. Sāvitrī
took the axe and supporting her husband in the dim
moon light, walked to the hermitage.
<div n="NI"/>Dyumatsena got sight. He started with his wife in
search of his children, and walked about in the forest.
At last all of them met together. They reached home.
Then Sāvitrī told them all that had happened. Every-
one was delighted. Then some people from Sālva came
to the hermitage. They said that the minister had
killed the King, that the people had expelled the
minister, and that they had come to request Dyumat-
sena to return to his country and to resume the reign.
Accordingly all of them returned to Sālva. Dyumatsena
was anointed as the King of Sālva. (M.B. Vana Parva,
Chapters 293 to 299).
