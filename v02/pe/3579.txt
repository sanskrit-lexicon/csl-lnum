KOLASAVRŪPA¦ (KOLATTUNĀḌU). After the decline
of the second Cera empire in Kerala, several royal
families such as Perumpaṭappu, Neḍuvirippu, Kolasva-
rūpa, Veṇāṭu etc. came into power. Some details regard-
ing the family of Kolasvarūpa are given below.
<div n="NI"/>In ‘Kerala Māhātmya’, it is given that Paraśurāma
had made a Soma-Kṣatriya, as King of Cirakkal or
Kolattunāḍu. According to ‘Keralotpatti’ it was Cera-
mān Perumāl who did this. Logan says that Kolasva-
rūpa came into being from the children born to the
last Perumāl of the Veṇāṭu family. In the edicts Vīra-
rāghavapaṭṭaya or Jūtaśāsana no mention is made
about Kolattunāḍu. Both the families of Veṇāṭu and
Kolattunāḍu, from very early times had observed
the customary rites of taint, pollution, defilement etc.
It is said in ‘Keralamāhātmya’ that Paraśurāma had
enthroned the sons of two sisters in both the kingdoms.

But no documents are available to prove that there
was any connection between the two families till the 5th
century M.E. (Malayālam Era). i.e. 14th century A.D.
