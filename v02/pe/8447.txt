VIROCANA I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} An asura. He was the son of
Prahlāda and the father of Mahābali. Three sons Viro-
cana, Kumbha and Nikumbha were born to Prahlāda
by his wife Dhṛti. Virocana, though an asura, perform-
ed rites and rituals carefully. He was kind towards
Brahmins. His son Bali became famous and got the
name Mahābali. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 65, Stanza
19).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Once there was a controversy between Virocana
and Sudhanvā. (See under Sudhanvā II).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) During the time of emperor Pṛthu, when the
[Page862-a+ 64]
asuras milked the earth Virocana stood as the calf.
(M.B. Droṇa Parva, Chapter 69, Stanza 20).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Virocana is included among the ancient Kings of
prominence. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 227, Stanza
50).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) There is a story about the quest for knowledge
about universal and individual souls, by Indra and
Virocana, in Chāndogyopaniṣad, as given below.
<div n="NI"/>Once the Devas and the asuras approached Prajāpati
to learn about Brahman, the impersonal God. Prajā-
pati told them: “Ātman (soul) is the first tattva
(Essential being) which is sinless, eternal, desireless
and unimaginable in the earth.” Having heard this
philosophy about the soul, the Devas selected Indra,
and the asuras selected Virocana and to know the
details, they sent them to Prajāpati as his disciples.
<div n="NI"/>Indra and Virocana stayed with Prajāpati for several
years to know more about Ātman. But Prajāpati did
not reveal to them the secret about Brahman. At last to
test them Prajāpati said “Your reflection that you see in
water or mirror is the Ātman (soul).”
<div n="NI"/>Virocana, who mistook what the Prajāpati said as truth
immediately took his bath, put on costly dress and orna-
ments and stood near water and saw his reflection in water.
After that, taking the reflection for soul, he spread this
doctrine among his people. With this the asuras accept-
ed body as soul. But the Devas did not recognize this
philosophy. They accepted the doctrine that Ātman is
that essence of Nature which is alien to body and mind
and which is pure.
<div n="NI"/>(v) There are two different statements about the death
of Virocana in the Purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>(1) In the battle with Tārakāsura, Virocana was killed
by Devendra. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 99.
Brahmāṇḍa 1. 20. 35; Matsya: 10: 11; Padma Purāṇa,
Sṛṣṭi Khaṇḍa 16).
<div n="NI"/>(2) The Sun God was pleased with Virocana and had
given him a crown. The sun told him that death would
come only if that crown was removed from the head by
some body. Because of this boon Virocana became
arrogant. So Mahāviṣṇu took the form of a beautiful
woman and enticed Virocana towards him and taking
away the crown killed him. (Gaṇeśa Purāṇa 2, 29).
<div n="NI"/>According to Nārada Purāṇa, Mahāviṣṇu took the form
of a Brahmin and reached the palace of Virocana. There
changing the righteous wife of Virocana into a mad
woman he killed Virocana.
<div n="NI"/>(vi) Virocana had two wives called Viśālākṣī and Devī.
Two children, Bala and Ya odharā were born by them.
The wife of the famous Tvaṣṭā was this Yaśodharā.
(Brahmāṇḍa. 3: 1: 86; Nārada Purāṇa 2: 32: Bhāga-
vata, Skandha 9).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) Virocana had five brothers named Kumbha, Nikum-
bha, Āyuṣmān, Śibi and Bāṣkali and a sister named
Virocanā. (Vāyu Purāṇa. 84, 19).
