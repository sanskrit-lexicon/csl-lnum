PAUṆḌRAKA II¦. (Pauṇḍrakavāsudeva). A king of an-
cient Kārūṣa. Once he sent a messenger to Dvārakā and
told Kṛṣṇa thus: “Oh Kṛṣṇa, I am the real Vāsudeva.
Therefore put down all your royal emblems and robes
and come and worship at my feet.” As soon as Kṛṣṇa
heard it he got angry and moved to Kārūṣa with a
large army and killed Pauṇḍrakavāsudeva. 10th Skan-
