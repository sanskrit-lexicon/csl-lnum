PAÑCAVAṬĪ¦. The sacred place where Śrī Rāma built
an āśrama and lived for some time with Sītā and
Lakṣmaṇa during their exile in the forests. There is a
story about Pañcavaṭī in the Kamba Rāmāyaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Pañcavaṭī is on the southern bank of the Godāvarī.
Five Vaṭavṛkṣas (banyan trees) stand here in a circle
and therefore, the place got the name Pañcavaṭī. There
is a legend about these banyan trees. Once five Gan-
dharva youths encircled the sage Agastya in the forest
as a sport and prevented him from moving towards any
direction. The enraged sage cursed them to stand in
the same position as banyan trees. Thus by obstructing
the movements of a divine man they were forced to
remain without movement as trees. Before they took
the form of trees they begged the sage for deliverance
from the curse. Agastya said, “One day Śri Rāma with
his wife and brother will come and stay in an āśrama
built in your midst. Their holy presence will give
you salvation from my curse.”
<div n="NI"/>Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa when they came to that
forest decided to build an āśrama in the centre of the
circle formed by the five banyan trees. Lakṣmaṇa
started to build the hermitage. At first he cut down one
of the trees standing tall and straight and to the
surprise and astonishment of all the fallen trunk of the
tree disappeared and there in its place lay the dead
[Page562-a+ 64]
body of a demon youth. It was the body of Śambhu-
kumāra, son of Śūrpaṇakhā. He was doing penance
there when Śrī Rāma came there with Sītā and becom-
ing lustful at the sight of Sītā he stood there as a tree.
It was he who was cut down by Lakṣmaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Śrī Rāma understood the thing that happened. He
then explained to Sītā and Lakṣmaṇa many things
about the frauds and deceits of the demons. After that
they built their hermitage there and dwelt there for a
long time. (Araṇya Kāṇḍa, Kamba Rāmāyaṇa).
