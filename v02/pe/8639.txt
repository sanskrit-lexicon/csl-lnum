VṚṢĀDARBHI II¦. A famous son of Śibi. The follow-
ing is a story given in Mahābhārata about this Vṛṣā-
darbhi.
<div n="NI"/>Once the seven hermits started for going round the earth.
At this time Vṛṣādarbhi had been performing a sacri-
fice. Vṛṣādarbhi invoked the seven hermits and gave them
his son as a gift. The child died before long. As famine
was prevailing everywhere the hermits were weak and

worn out by hunger. They wished to eat the flesh of
the child. Vṛṣādarbhi tried to dissuade the hermits
from this beastly action in vain. At last the angry King
created a wicked fairy to kill the hermits. Though the
fairy attacked the hermits, Indra, who had lived with
the seven hermits killed the fairy.
<div n="NI"/>Vṛṣādarbhi was not at all behind his father Śibi in
liberality. There are various stories in Mahābhārata to
illustrate this.
