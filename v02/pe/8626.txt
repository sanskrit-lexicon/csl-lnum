VṚṢA IV¦. An incarnation of Śiva in the form of an ox.
The following is a story that occurs in Śiva Purāṇa,
Śatarudasaṃhitā, about this incarnation.
<div n="NI"/>When the Devas and the Asuras united together
and churned the sea of milk, ever so many noble objects
rose up to the surface of the sea. Several beautiful
damsels also came up. Viṣṇu grew amorous of them
and thus thousands of sons were born by them. These sons
who were born in the Pātāla (Nether world), by and by,
came up and began to do harm to the dwellers of the
earth. At this time Śiva took the incarnation in the
form of an ox to study the situation properly. In this
disguise Śiva entered Pātāla and took by stealth the
Sudarśana (the weapon of Viṣṇu) and drove him to
heaven. When Viṣṇu had gone from Pātāla, he had
advised his sons to stay in Pātāla. Vṛṣa who came to
know of this, cursed them:—“Any man, other than the
peaceful hermits and Dānavas (asuras) who are born
from my portion, who enters Pātāla shall die.” From
that day onwards, the world of Pātāla became a for-
bidden place for men.
