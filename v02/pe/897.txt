BALĀKA¦ (VALĀKA). A forester. This forester used to
go for hunting and he gave everything he got to his old
parents without reserving anything for himself. One
day he did not find any animal even though he had
made a thorough search in the forest. He was much
worried. At last he reached the bank of a river. He
saw an extraordinary animal drinking water. He had
never seen such an animal before.

<div n="NI"/>It was a peculiar creature. That creature had done
penance before Brahmā, from its young age with the view
of destroying everything. Brahmā appeared before the
creature and granted it the boon that it would have the
power to make anything blind. Brahmā also said that
anybody who killed the creature would be given a place
in the realm of Gods. The creature had been wandering
in the forest making blind every creature it met, and
one day it was drinking water and it was then that
Valāka shot it down. As soon as the creature fell down
the gods showered flowers, and took him to the realm
of Gods in a divine chariot. (M.B., Karṇa Parva,
Chapter 69).
