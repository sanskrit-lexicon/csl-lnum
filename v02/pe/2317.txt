GAṆḌAKĪ¦(GAṆḌAKA). A river in Orthern India
which falls into the Gaṅgā.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Origin.%} There arose an argument between the
[Page274-a+ 64]
Devas and the asuras about the Amṛtam (nectar) got
from the churning of Kṣīrābdhi (the milk ocean) and
Mahāviṣṇu appeared in the form of Mohinī and enti-
ced the asuras away from the subject and gave the
nectar to the Devas. Attracted by the great beauty of
Mohinī, Śiva made love to her, and the sweet produced
at the time of their embrace flowed as river Gaṇḍaki
through the earth. (Skandha Purāṇa, Āsura Khaṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%It became a holy river.%} While the worms on the banks
of Gaṇḍakī were once collecting soil they fell into the
river, and all at once they attained salvation, the reason
being that the water in the river had been formed by
the sweet of Viṣṇu and Śiva. And, from that day on-
wards people began worshipping Gaṇḍakī as a holy
river. (Skandha Purāṇa, Āsura Khaṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other information.%}

sins. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 169, Verse 20).
