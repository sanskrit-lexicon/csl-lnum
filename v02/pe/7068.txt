SUMADA¦. A muni who did penance at Vimala on the
Hemakūṭa mountain. When twelve years had passed
thus Indra got frightened and deputed Kāmadeva to
disturb the muni's penance. Many Deva women also
accompanied Kāmadeva. All their attempts failed to
have any effect on the muni. Ultimately Devī appeared
before him and asked him to choose his boon to which
he answered thus: “I do penance to regain my kingdom
[Page763-a+ 65]
lost to enemies. Also, I should develop eternal devotion
to you and finally attain salvation.”
<div n="NI"/>Devī assured him recovery of his lost kingdom which he
would rule till the sacrificial horse of Śrī Rāma in con-
nection with the aśvamedha yajña came to his kingdom.
Accordingly Sumada conquered his enemies and became
king in Ahicchatra. After many years, in connection
with Śrī Rāma's aśvamedha, Śatrughna with the yājñic
horse reached Ahicchatra. Sumada welcomed Śatrughna
and in his company went to Ayodhyā and detailed
everything to Śrī Rāma. He then abdicated his throne
in favour of his son and attained salvation. See under
Ahicchatra. (Padma Purāṇa, Pātāla Khaṇḍa, Chapter
13).
