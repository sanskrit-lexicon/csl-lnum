BHOGAVATĪ I¦. Nāgaloka or Pātāla. When Sugrīva
sent monkeys in all directions in search of Sītā, he gave
instructions to them to go and search for her in Bhoga-
vatīpura. Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, 41st Sarga, Kiṣkindhā-
kāṇḍa describes the place as the city infested with ser-
pents (nāgas) and guarded by them. Vāsuki, King of
serpents, lives there.
