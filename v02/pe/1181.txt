BHṚGU¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} A sage, the son of Brahmā. He was the
founder of Bhṛgu vaṃśa. Members of the Bhṛgu vaṃśa
are called ‘Bhārgavas.’ Bhṛguvaṃśa has been reputed
for many of its members who were Ṛṣis of great sanctity
and grandeur.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%}
<Poem>“Utsaṃgād Nārado jajñe
Dakṣo 'ṃguṣṭhāt svayaṃbhuvaḥ /
Prāṇādvasiṣṭhaḥ saṃjāto
Bhṛgustvacaḥ karātkratuḥ”.
<F>*) Nārada was born from Brahmā's lap, Dakṣa from his Aṃguṣṭha, Vasiṣṭha from his Prāṇa, Bhṛgu from his skin and Kṛatu from his arm.</F> //</Poem>
[Page139-b+ 55]
<div n="NI"/>From these lines we see that Bhṛgu was born from
Brahmā's skin (tvak). But in M.B. Ādi Parva, 5th
Chapter, we find another version regarding his birth.
In that passage we read that Bhṛgu was born from
“Vahni” (fire). In the light of these two statements, we
may examine Bhṛgu's birth.
<div n="NI"/>Bhṛgu had two incarnations. The first time he was born
from Brahmā's skin. In course of time, the sage Bhṛgu
became famous. In the Dakṣayāga, this sage was pre-
sent as one of the Ṛtviks (officiating priests). On that
occasion, Satīdevī who was in rage and grief because
her husband (Śiva) was not invited to the yāga, commit-
ted suicide by jumping into the sacrificial fire. Hearing
about this, Śiva was enraged and the monster spirits who
emerged from his matted locks caught hold of the
Ṛtviks. Bhāgavata caturtha skandha says that the Bhūta
named Nandīśvara, who emerged from Śiva's locks,
caught hold of Bhṛgu and killed him.
<div n="NI"/>Therefore the Bhṛgu who was born from Brahmā's
skin must be considered as having died at Dakṣayāga.
Bhṛgu was born again in Vaivasvata Manvantara.
This second birth was at the famous Brahmayajña
of Varuṇa. He was reborn from fire, as Brahmā's son.
This child who was born from Brahmā's semen which
fell in the sacrificial fire, was brought up by Varuṇa
and his wife Carṣaṇī. Consequently Bhṛgu is referred
to as “Varuṇaputra” and “Carṣaṇīputra” in some
Purāṇas. Since he was born at Varuṇa's yāga he is
sometimes called “Vāruṇī Bhṛgu”.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Bhṛgu Vaṃśa. (Bhṛgu family).%} Each birth of Bhṛgu
gave rise to a separate family. They are given below
separately:—First birth: Bhṛgu and his wife Khyāti
had a daughter Lakṣmī and three sons, Dhātā, Vidhātā
and Kavi. Mahāmeru's daughters, Āyati and Niyati
became the wives of Dhātā and Vidhātā, respectively.
Two sons, Prāṇa and Mṛkaṇḍu were born to those two
couples. Mārkaṇḍeya was born to Mṛkaṇḍu and from
Mārkaṇḍeya was born Vedaśiras. Prāṇa had a son,
Dyutimān who had a son Rājavān. From that Rājavān,
Bhṛgu Vaṃśa multiplied. The family tree of this first
Bhṛgu Vaṃśa is given below:—(See Viṣṇu purāṇa,
Part I, Chapter 10).
<C n="1"/>BRAHMĀ
<C n="1"/>Bhṛgu <C n="2"/>Khyāti
<C n="1"/>Dhātā = Āyati <C n="2"/>Vidhātā = Niyati <C n="3"/>Kavi <C n="4"/>Lakṣmī = Viṣṇu
<C n="1"/>Prāṇa <C n="2"/>Mṛkaṇḍu
<C n="1"/>Dyutimān <C n="2"/>Mārkaṇḍeya
<C n="1"/>Rājavān <C n="2"/>Vedaśiras
<div n="NI"/>Second Birth: The second Bhṛgu Vaṃśa is the family
which took its origin from the second birth of Bhṛgu
as the son of Varuṇa. Varuṇa's son, Bhṛgu married
the woman, Pulomā. They had six children who were,
Bhūta, Cyavana, Vajraśīrṣa, Śuci, Śukra, and Savana.
By his first wife Bhūtā, he had his sons, “Ekādaśa
Rudras” (eleven Rudras) and “Rudra Pārṣadas”
[Page140-a+ 58]
(Attendants of Rudra) and by his second wife Sarūpā
he had a crore of Rudras. Cyavana had two wives,
Sukanyā and Āruṣi. Aurva, a son was born to Āruṣi.
From Aurva was born Ṛcīka, from Ṛcīka Jamadagni
and from Jamadagni, Paraśurāma. Cyavana had a
son, Pravati, by his wife Sukanyā. Ruru or Śunaka was
the son of Pravati by the Apsarā Ghṛtācī. Ruru
and his wife Pramadvarā had a son, Śaunaka. Śuka,
the son of Bhṛgu had two sons, Caṇḍa and Alarka and
a daughter, Devayānī. This is the second Bhṛgu Vaṃśa.
<F>1) Devī Bhāgavata, Saptama Skandha says that Bhṛgu had married two daughters of Dakṣa. Mahābhārata Anuśāsana Parva
Chapter 85, Verse 127 says that Bhrgu had seven sons, namely Cyavana Vajraśīla, Śuci, Aurva, Śukra, Vareṇya, and Savana.</F>

<div n="NI"/>4) {%Bhṛgu cursed Mahāviṣṇu.%} Once a terrible war broke
out between Devas and Asuras. In that war, not only
were the Asuras defeated but many of them were also
killed. Diti, the mother of the Asuras, with tears in her
eyes, complained to Bhṛgupati. Pulomā, Mother of
Śukra, promised to find a remedy for this somehow.
She at once went to the forest and started a tapas for
the annihilation of the Devas. As the tapas gained
force, the Devas were alarmed and they sought the
protection of Mahāviṣṇu. Mahāviṣṇu used his
Vajrāyudha (Vajra weapon) against Bhṛgu's wife,
Pulomā. Under the stroke of Vajra she fell down, a
headless corpse. The enraged Maharṣi Bhṛgu cursed
Mahāviṣṇu to be born as a mortal in this world and to
suffer the pangs of separation from his wife. When the
curse was pronounced against Mahāviṣṇu, he directed
his weapon Cakra against the Maharṣi. Bhṛgu fied in
panic and at last begged pardon and prayed for shelter
to Mahāviṣṇu himself in the ocean of milk. Viṣṇu
withdrew his Cakra. Bhṛgu himself restored Pulomā
to life. To fulfil the condition of Bhṛgu's curse, Viṣṇu
agreed to incarnate in the world as Śrī Rāma, the son
of Daśaratha and to experience the pain of separation
from his wife. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Bhṛgu kicked Viṣṇu.%} Long ago all the Maharṣis
joined together to perform a yāga on the bank of the
river Sarasvatī. A dispute arose among them as to who
was the most mighty among the Trimūrtis. Some of
them voted for Brahmā, others declared that Viṣṇu
was more mighty than the other two, while a third
group stood for Śiva's superiority. They unanimously
elected Bhṛgu to ascertain and find out the truth of
the matter.
[Page140-b+ 43]
<div n="NI"/>Bhṛgu set out to Devaloka. First he went to Brahmā's
assembly. There, in the presence of Brahmā who was
seated in the midst of many Munis, Bhṛgu took his seat
on a stool. Brahmā was provoked by this act of disres-
pect. Bhṛgu left the place without a word and went to
Śiva's place. Śiva rose from his seat and approached
him to embrace and welcome him. Bhṛgu, shrank back
saying, “Do not touch me?” Śiva became angry and
was about to hit him with his trident when Pārvatī
stopped him.
<div n="NI"/>Bhṛgu then turned his steps to Vaikuṇṭha, the abode of
Mahāviṣṇu. There he saw Mahāviṣṇu in a deep
slumber. Seeing Mahāviṣṇu whose task is the pre-
servation of the world, sleeping like an irresponsible
person, Bhṛgu gave him a kick on his breast. Viṣṇu
who sprang up suddenly, saw Bhṛgu standing before
him. He begged pardon of the sage. He declared that
he would carry Bhṛgu's footprint permanently on his
chest as a sign of his repentance for having shown dis-
respect to the Maharṣi. This foot-print still remains
on Viṣṇu's chest and is known by the name “Śrīvatsa”.
In this way, the Munis came to the conclusion that
Mahāviṣṇu is the noblest of the Trimūrtis. (Bhāgavata,
Daśama Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%The origin of Bhṛgu Tīrtha.%} There is a sacred spot
called, “Bhṛgu Tīrtha” on the western side of Daśāśva-
medha. It is here that Bhṛgu once offered tapas to Śiva.
Owing to the austerity of his tapas, his hair became
matted and discoloured. His body was completely
covered with earth heaped up by termites. When Śiva
was still not propitiated, Pārvatī interceded with him
on behalf of Bhṛgu, Śiva agreed to bless Bhṛgu.
<div n="NI"/>Śiva sent his bull to the place where Bhṛgu was sitting.
The bull in the course of its gambols broke up and des-
troyed the earthen covering on his body which was
made by the termites. Bhṛgu became angry and chased
the bull. But he was stunned by the sight of the bull
rising up to heaven through the air. A divine light
spread there. Śiva appeared before him and asked him
what boon he wanted. Bhṛgu prayed that the place
where he was doing tapas should become a holy spot.
Śiva granted his prayer and from that day, the place
became famous under the name “Bhṛgu Tīrtha”.
[Page141-a+ 62]
Brahmā and other Devas and the Kinnaras still worship
this Bhṛgu Tīrtha. All sin is removed by a mere sight
of this sacred Tīrtha. Those who bathe in the holy
water of this place attain Heaven and they will not be
born again. Even by hearing about the greatness and
glory of this Bhṛgu Tīrtha, one will be cleared of all
sins and find an easy way to Śivaloka. (Padma Purāṇa,
Chapter 20).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Other details.%} (1) It was Bhṛgu who gave the boon
for having progeny to Sagara, King of the solar dynasty.
Sagara, with his two wives, Keśinī and Sumati, per-
formed tapas at Bhṛgu prasravaṇa in the Himālayas.
After a hundred years, Bhṛgu, who was pleased, blessed
the king that he would have numerous children by one
wife and one son who would be progenitor of a vaṃśa,
by the other wife. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa,
38th Sarga).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Once when some Munis went to Dvārakā, Sāmba
and other Yādavas mocked them and the Munis cursed
them. Bhṛgu was one of those Munis. (See the word
Sāmba).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Paraśurāma, after exterminating the Kṣatriya kings,
went to the Āśrama of Bhṛgu, the founder of the family
and received his blessings. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chap-
ter 62).

ṭhira's assembly. (M.B. Chapter 4, Verse 16).

<div n="NI"/>(15) He got the name “Bhṛgu” because he was born out
of fire. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 85, Verse 105).
<div n="NI"/>(16) It was Bhṛgu who gave the necessary advice to
Agastya to depose Nahuṣa from Indra's post.
[Page141-b+ 63]
<div n="NI"/>(17) There is a story that Nahuṣa kicked Agastya on the
head while the latter was carrying Nahuṣa's palanquin
