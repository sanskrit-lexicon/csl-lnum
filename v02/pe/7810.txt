UTATHYA I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Son of sage A giras. (M.B. Ādi Parva,
Chapter 66, Verse 5). He gave advice on subjects of
statecraft to King Māndhātā. (M.B. Śānti Parva,
Chapter 90). He married Soma's daughter Bhadrā.
(M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 154, Verse 12).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Utathya drank up the sea dry.%} Varuṇa deva had an
eye on Soma's daughter Bhadrā when Utathya married
her. Incensed at the marriage, Varuṇa carried Bhadrā
off to the sea one day when Utathya was not present.
Nārada informed Utathya that it was Varuṇa who
stole his wife. Though Nārada, at the request of
Utathya, asked Varuṇa to return Bhadrā to the former
he did not oblige. Enraged at this Utathya drank up
the sea dry. Yet, Varuṇa did not come round. Then
Utathya rendered all the lakes of Varuṇa dry. Trem-
bling at this Varuṇa returned Bhadrā to Utathya and
prostrated at his feet. He pardoned Varuṇa and gave
back the sea to him. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter
154).
