VITASTĀ¦. A river famous in the Purāṇas. Mention is
made about this river in Ṛgveda. Important rivers
mentioned in Ṛgveda are, Kubhā, Sindhu, Suvāstu
Vitastā, Asiknī, Paruṣṇī, Śatadrū, Sarasvatī and
Yamunā. These rivers were more important than the
Ganges in those days. Mention is made about the
Ganges only once in Ṛgveda. Perhaps the Āryans were
not acquainted with the Gangetic basin in those days.
The region from the rivers Kubhā to Yamunā was
Āryadeśa (the country of the Āryans). The information
about this river Vitastā given in Mahābhārata is given
below:—
<div n="NI"/>(i) The river Vitastā is the same river as Jhelum in
Kashmir. The deity (goddess) of this river stays in the
palace of Varuṇa and praises him. (M.B. Sabhā Parva,
Chapter 9, Stanza 19).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) By worshipping the Devatās and the Manes after
taking bath in this river, one could obtain the fruits of
performing the sacrifice Vājapeya. In Kashmir, Takṣaka
the King of the Nāgas has a famous palace known as
Vitasta. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 82, Stanza 39).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Once four hundred horses with black ears, owned
by Brahmins were caught in the current of this river
and carried away. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 119,
Stanza 8).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) If anybody bathes in the waves of the river Vita-
stā, with vow and fasts, for seven days he would become
as pure as a hermit. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter
25, Stanza 7).
<div n="NI"/>(v) Once Pārvatī made a speech before Śiva on the
duties of women, after receiving advice from rivers.
The river Vitastā was one of the rivers which advised
Pārvatī. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 146, Stanza
18).
