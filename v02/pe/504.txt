AŚOKAVANIKĀ¦. A famous park in Laṅkā. It was in
this park that Rāvaṇa kept Sītā having stolen her from
Śrī Rāma. It is described in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
Sundarakāṇḍa, Sarga 14 and Araṇyakāṇḍa, Sarga 56
and in Mahābhārata also:—
<div n="NI"/>“Thinking of her husband alone, clad in the garments
of a hermit woman, eating only roots and fruits, in
prayer and fast, in sorrow and sadness, she of the wide
eyes lived in the Aśoka park which seemed as a hermit-
age.” (Bhāṣā Bhārata, Araṇya Parva Chapter 280,
Stanzas 42 and 43).
