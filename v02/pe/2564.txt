HAṂSADHVAJA¦. A King of Campānagarī, who
was a great devotee of Viṣṇu. During his reign
[Page307-a+ 64]
monogamy prevailed in the country. He took the
yājñic horse of Yudhiṣṭhira captive, and in the fight to
release the horse Arjuna killed Sudhanvā and Suratha,
sons of Haṃsadhvaja. Grieved and enraged at their
death Haṃsadhvaja took the field against Arjuna, and
Śrī Kṛṣṇa finding that Arjuna's life was in danger
pacified them both. Also Kṛṣṇa requested Haṃsadhvaja
to be a supporter of Arjuna in future. Haṃsadhvaja
had five sons called Suratha, Sudhanvā, Sudarśa,
Subala and Sama. (Jaimini, Aśvamedha Parva, 17,
21).
