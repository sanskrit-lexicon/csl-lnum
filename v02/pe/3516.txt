KHĀṆḌAVADĀHA¦.
1){%Introduction.%} Long ago a King named Śvetakī began
to perform a sacrifice of duration of 100 years. Many
Brahmins took part in the sacrifice as priests conducting
the rituals and ceremonies. These Brahmin priests be-
gan to depart after a few years turning blind due to the
smoke coming out of the sacrificial fire. Thus the sacrifice
was stopped for want of priests. Śvetakī was grieved at
this and performed penance to Śiva for getting a
priest. Śiva appeared before him and pointed out
hermit Durvāsas as the priest. Śvetakī recommenced the
sacrifice and under the supervision of Durvāsas the
sacrifice was completed. But Fire god caught dysen-
tery due to the continuous eating of oblations offered in
the sacrificial fire for a long period. His face became
pale, body became lean, and he had no taste for food.
At last Fire-God went to Brahmā and complained
about his disease. Brahmā said that in the forest of
Khāṇḍava there lived so many creatures which were
enemies of the devas (gods) and that by eating their
fat the disease of Agni would be cured. Accordingly
Agni came to the Khāṇḍava forest.
[Page409-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>The serpent Takṣaka, a friend of Indra, lived in this
forest with his wife and children. Indra knew that Agni
had come to burn the Khāṇḍava forest and resolved to
save Takṣaka at any cost. When Agni (fire) began to
catch the forest, Indra had already begun rain. So it
was not possible for Agni to consume the forest. Agni
tried seven times to consume the forest and in all these
seven attempts he failed. Agni again approached
Brahmā, who told him that the Nara-Nārāyaṇas would
take birth in the earth as Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna and that
at that time it would be possible for fire to consume the
forest Khāṇḍava.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna in the forest of Khāṇḍava.%} While the
Pāṇḍavas were living in Indraprastha, once the hot
season became so unbearable that Arjuna took Kṛṣṇa with
him and went to the forest of Khāṇḍava. While they
were playing in the river Yamunā with their wives
Agni came there in the guise of an old Brahmin and told
them all that had happened and requested their help
for eating the Khāṇḍava forest. Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna
promised to help him in this affair.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Preparation of weapons.%} For the time being Kṛṣṇa
and Arjuna were not having sufficient weapons. Agni
(fire-god) thought of Varuṇa (the God of water) who
instantly appeared. At the request of Agni Varuṇa gave
Arjuna the famous bow ‘Candradhanus’ (Gāṇḍīva), a
quiver which would never become empty of arrows
and a chariot having a flag with the sign of monkey.
and to Śrī Kṛṣṇa the weapon of the discus. Varuṇa gave
four white horses also with gold chains round their necks
for drawing the chariot of Arjuna. With these weapons
Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna got ready to help Agni. Śrī Kṛṣṇa
became the charioteer of Arjuna.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Burning the forest.%} When Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna stood
ready Agni began to consume the forest. Kṛṣṇa and
Arjuna guarded the boundaries of the forest so that
the inmates of the forest might not escape. The living
creatures ran hither and thither finding no way to
escape. Many died of suffocation. At that time the
hermits who were dwellers of that forest ran to Indra
and informed him of the great calamity. Indra instantly
got ready to fight and save the forest. He covered the
whole of the sky with clouds and a heavy rain was
showered on the forest. Arjuna created a covering of
arrows like an umbrella over the fire and saved him
from the rain.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The family of Takṣaka.%} At this particular time
Takṣaka had been away at Kurukṣetra. Aśvasena the
son of Takṣaka was writhing with heat and pain.
Seeing this his mother (wife of Takṣaka) swallowed him
from tail to head. Then she ran to the boundary to
throw the child into the outer region. Seeing this
Arjuna got angry and cut at the head of Aśvasena. But
at the nick of time Indra sent a storm and made Arjuna
swoon and Aśvasena was saved. So Arjuna became
furious and began to cut down every creature he saw.
Arjuna, Kṛṣṇa and Agni together cursed Aśvasena that
he would get refuge nowhere.
<div n="NI"/>Aśvasena kept up his hatred of Arjuna. In the Bhārata
battle, Aśvasena got on an arrow sent by Karṇa at
Arjuna and knocked off the crown of Arjuna and return-
ed. But due to the curse Karṇa did not receive him
back.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Deadly fight.%} The serpents and hawks confronted
Arjuna, who cut off their heads. Kṛṣṇa killed the
[Page409-b+ 65]
Asuras with the weapon discus. Indra came to the
battle-field riding on his elephant Airāvata. Kāla
(Time), Kubera, Skanda, Aśvinīdevas and all the other
Devas (gods), and Asuras (demons) helped Indra in the
fight. But Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna came out victorious.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%The advent of Maya.%} Meanwhile Kṛṣṇa and
Arjuna called Indra and told him who they were and
informed him that Takṣaka had gone to Kurukṣetra.
Hearing this Indra blessed Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna and
retreated from the battlefield. Agni began to consume
the forest more vigorously than before. Because of the
unbearable heat, Maya, the architect of the Asuras,
came out of the house of Takṣaka and ran to Kṛṣṇa
and Arjuna and entreated them to save him. Accordingly
Arjuna saved him from the fire.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%The story of four birds which escaped from the fire.%} In
that forest a hermit named Mandapāla had erected his
hermitage and lived there performing penance. He died
and went to the world of ancestors. But there, the hermit
did not attain any fruit of the penance he had performed.
The hermit asked the Devas for the reason. They replied
that it was because the hermit had no sons. The hermit
came to the forest again to marry and beget sons.
Mandapāla married a bird called Jaritā. Four sons named
Jaritāri, Sārisṛkka, Stambamitra and Droṇa, were born
to them. After this Mandapāla left Jaritā and her sons
and went after another woman Lapitā.
<div n="NI"/>Feathers were not yet grown on the body of Jaritā's
four sons. The burning of the forest began before it.
Jaritā and her sons were in a sorry plight. The mother
could fly. But she did not think of leaving her young
ones in danger. She decided to die in the fire folding
the young ones under her wings. But her sons did not agree
to it. They entreated her to fly away. Thus moments of
tears passed by. At last Jaritā told them crying, “There
is the hole of a rat closeby. The rat had been taken
away by a kite. I will take you to that hole and close
it. Then I shall go away and return when the fire is
abated.”
<div n="NI"/>But the young ones did not agree to this. They loved
to be killed by fire, rather than to be killed by rat. Final-
ly at their request Jaritā flew away.
<div n="NI"/>Mandapāla thought of his sons. He separated from
Lapitā, and came to Agni and requested him to save
his sons and Jaritā. Agni consumed the forest and
neared the birds. The young birds requested Agni to
save them. Agni Deva saved them. Mandapāla and
Jaritā returned. That family lived for a long time in
joy and happiness and finally attained the world of the
gods. Agni returned to heaven after the burning of
the forest of Khāṇḍava. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapters 233
to 346).
