BHĀNUMATĪ I¦. The daughter of Bhānu, a leader of
the Yādavas. When Śrī Kṛṣṇa went with his retinue of
Yādavas to visit the holy palace called Piṇḍāraka the
Yādavas conducted a wine festival. During that festi-
val a demon of the name Nikumbha carried away
Bhānumatī. This was because of a curse to Bhānumatī
from Durvāsas whom Bhānumatī did not respect once
when they met at the garden of Raivata. Durvāsas had
after the curse consoled her by assuring her that she
would be saved and married by Sahadeva, one of the
Pāṇḍavas. True to this, Bhānumatī was married to Saha-
deva in the presence of Nārada and Kṛṣṇa. (Viṣṇu
Parva, Chapter 90).
