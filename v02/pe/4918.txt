PADMĀVATĪ VI¦. Wife of a Vaiśya named Praṇidhi.
Once Praṇidhi went to a neighbouring village for trade.
Padmāvatī and her companions were one day bathing
in a river nearby when a Śūdra passed that way.
Attracted by her dazzling beauty he remained there
talking to her. The Śūdra named Dharmadhvaja was
greatly enamoured of her and the companions of
Padmāvatī, noticing that, just to make fun of him said
“If you abandon your life at the point where the rivers
Gaṅgā and Yamunā meet you can attain Padmāvatī.”
Without any hesitation, thinking that what they said
was true, he went and ended his life at the place suggest-
ed. Immediately he became a replica of Praṇidhi and
stood before Padmāvatī. The real Praṇidhi also came
there then. Padmāvatī was in a fix to choose the real
husband. Mahāviṣṇu appeared before them then and
asked Pādmāvatī to accept both of them as her husbands
Padmāvatī pleaded it was forbidden for women of her
community to accept more than one husband and then
Mahāviṣṇu took all the three along with him to
Vaikuṇṭha. (Kriyā Khaṇḍa, Padma Purāṇa, Chap-
ter 4).
