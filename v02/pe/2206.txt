DUṢPAṆYA¦. Last son of a merchant in Pāṭalīputra.
Short-tempered and haughty, this Duṣpaṇya killed many
children. The King outlawed him. He went into the
forest where he drowned the child of maharṣi Ugraśravas
The maharṣi cursed him that he also should end his life
by drowning and his soul roam about in unsupportable
distress. The curse came true. After roaming about for
many years he approached Agastya and prayed for
redemption from the curse. The sage directed his dis-
ciple, Sutīkṣṇa to get holy water from Agnitīrtha in
Mount Gandhamādana and sprinkle it on the sinful
soul of Duṣpaṇya. Sutīkṣṇa did as he was asked by the
guru, and the soul of Duṣpaṇya attained salvation.
(Setumāhātmyam).
