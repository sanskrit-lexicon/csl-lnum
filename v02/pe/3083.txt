KĀLA I¦.
<F>2.) Kāla and Dharma are not the same person. See under Dharma.</F>(YAMA). The god of Death. When the life
span of each living being allotted by Brahmā is at an
end Yama sends his agents and takes the soul to Yama-
purī (the city of Yama). From there, the holy souls
are sent to Vaikuṇṭha (Heaven, the abode of Viṣṇu) and
the sinful souls to Hell.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy and birth of Yama.%} From Mahāviṣṇu were
descended in the following order—Brahmā, Marīci,
Kaśyapa, Sūrya (Sun), Yama (Kāla).
<div n="NI"/>Sūrya married Saṃjñā, daughter of Viśvakarmā. They
had three children, Manu, Yama and Yamī. Of them,
Yama has the task of taking away the souls of those
whose life-span is at an end. Once Saṃjñā who was
unable to bear the dazzling brilliance of Sūrya, ordered
her maid Chhāyā to attend on him and went to the
forest for performing penance. Mistaking her for his
wife Saṃjñā, Sūrya begot of her three sons namely,
Śaniścara, Manu and Tapatī. Once Chhāyā cursed
Yama for disobedience. Then Sūrya and Yama under-
stood that she was not Saṃjñā. After that the Aśvinī-
kumāras, Revanta and Bhayā were born to Sūrya and
Saṃjñā. Thus Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part III, Chapter 2 says
that Yama was the brother of Manu, Yamī, the
Aśvinī Kumāras, Tapatī, Śanaiścara and Bhayā. Yama's
sister Bhayā was married by the Asura, Heti. Sunīthā
was the eldest daughter of Yama. Aṃga married her.
The famous King Vena was her son. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa,
Part I, Chapter 13).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Yama is a Dikpālaka.%} Once Kubera offered penance
to Brahmā for ten thousand years in water, head down-
wards and in the middle of Pañcāgni. Brahmā who was
pleased, appeared before him and Kubera prayed to him
that he should be made one of the Lokapālakas. Accord-
ingly Brahmā ordered that thenceforth, Indra should
rule in the East, Yama in the South, Varuṇa in the
West and Kubera in the North. Yama's city is called
Saṃyaminī. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Curse on Yama.%} Yama was once cursed by the sage
Aṇi Māṇḍavya. It was as a result of it that Yama was
born as Vidura. (For details see under Aṇimāṇḍavya).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Yama became Maharṣi.%} Śrī Rāma who returned after
his forest life became king of Ayodhyā. He ruled over
[Page368-a+ 65]
the country for 11,000 years. Then it was time to recall
Mahāviṣṇu who had incarnated as Śrī Rāma, to Vai-
kuṇṭha. Brahmā sent Yama to the earth to bring back
Śrī Rāma. Yama who assumed the guise of a young
Maharṣi, went to Ayodhyā and visited Śrī Rāma.
He said that he was the disciple of the sage Atibala and
had come to tell him a secret. So Lakṣmaṇa was posted
at the entrance to prevent anyone from entering the
room. It was announced that anyone who tried to enter
would be slaughtered. After that, while Śrī Rāma and
Yama were having their secret talk, Durvāsas, the sage,
who was hungry after a fast of 1,000 years, arrived at
the door, asking for food. Lakṣmaṇa told him humbly
that he could not be allowed to enter just then.
Durvāsas, who became furious, was about to curse the
whole race of Kings. So Lakṣmaṇa entered the room
and informed Śrī Rāma of the arrival of Durvāsas. At
the same time, in fulfilment of the order, he was ready
to be slaughtered. Vasiṣṭha suggested that it would be
enough if Lakṣmaṇa was banished from the palace.
Accordingly he was expelled and he went and drowned
himself in the depths of the river Sarayū. Śrī Rāma
who was broken-hearted at his separation from Lakṣ-
maṇa went to the same river and drowned himself there
shortly after. Yama then took their souls to Vaikuṇṭha.
(Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Yama became crow.%} In Uttara Rāmāyaṇa there is
a story that at Marutta's Yāga, Yama who was frighten-
ed at the sight of Rāvaṇa, escaped in the form of a
crow. (For details, see under Crow).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%An Age without Yama.%} In the Purāṇas there are refe-
rences to three periods when there was no Yama.
<div n="NI"/>(1) One such period was in Kṛtayuga. At that time
there was no death on earth which became overcrowded
with living beings. Unable to bear their weight, the
earth sank down to a depth of 100 yojanas. The goddess
of Earth offered tearful prayers to Mahāviṣṇu, who
incarnated as Varāha (pig) and lifted up the earth 100
yojanas. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 142).
<div n="NI"/>(2) When Mārkaṇḍeya reached the age of sixteen,
Yama went to him to take away his life. Mārkaṇḍeya
hid himself behind the idol of Śiva. Yama threw his
noose at him but it fell round Śiva's neck. Śiva opened
his third eye and glared at Yama who was burnt to
ashes in its fire. (See under Mārkaṇḍeya).
<div n="NI"/>(3) See under Pāñcālī, Para 1, Sub Para 2.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Yama returned Satyavān's Life.%} (See under Satyavān).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Yama and King Nṛga.%} See under Nṛga.
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Yamapurī (the city of Yama).%} Yamapurī is thousand
yojanas in extent. There is an entrance on each of the
four sides. On one side of the city stands Citragupta's
mansion. The fort surrounding the city is made of iron.
There are a hundred streets in Yamapurī. They are all
decorated with banners and festoons. There is a group of
people in Citragupta's mansion. They are engaged in
calculating the life-span of living beings. They take into
account the vices and virtues of human beings. To the
south of Citragupta's residence is situated “Jvara-
mandira” (the abode of diseases). Adjacent to it are
the abodes of all kinds of diseases, each disease having
its own abode. Yama's home is situated at a distance
of twenty yojanas from the abode of Citragupta. It has
an area of two hundred yojanas and a height of fifty
yojanas. It is supported by one thousand columns. On
one side of it there is an extensive assembly hall. It is
[Page368-b+ 65]
here that those who have led virtuous lives in the world,
find their abode after death. They lead a life of eternal
heavenly bliss there. (Garuḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 14).
<div n="NI"/>(10) {%Naraka (Hell).%} There is a world called Pitṛloka in
the middle of the three worlds, on their southern side
below the earth and above the Atala loka. The Agniṣ-
vāttas and other piṭrs stay there in meditative trance
for securing prosperity to those who come to pitṛloka.
Yama is the ruler of pitṛloka. Since he is scrupulous in
imparting justice, Yama is also called Yamadharma.
He administers justice with an even hand to all living
beings brought there by his agents, according to their
virtues and vices during their earthly lives. He has
power to assess the virtues and vices of people and to
assign suitable punishments to them, but not to alter
the laws or methods of punishment. Sinners are sent to
the different Narakas by Yamadharma according to the
nature and seriousness of their sins. The Purāṇas refer
to twentyeight Narakas in all. They are:—
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Tāmisraṃ.%} Those who rob others of their wealth,
wives, children etc, are bound with ropes by Yama's
servants and cast into the Naraka known as Tāmisram.
There, they are given sound beating until they faint.
After they recover their senses, the beating is repeated
and those who try to escape are bound hand and foot
and pushed again into this hell. This is repeated as long
as Fate has ordained.
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Andhatāmtsram.%} This hell is intended for the wife
who takes food after deceiving the husband or the hus-
band who takes food after deceiving his wife. The
punishment there is the same as that of Tāmisram except
the beating. But the excruciating pain suffered by the
victims on being tied fast with Yama's rope by his
servants, makes them fall down senseless.
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%Rauravam.%} This is the hell into which those who
have persecuted other living beings are cast. Those
who seize and enjoy another man's property or resour-
ces, also come under ‘Persecution’. When such people
are thrown into this hell, those whom they had per-
secuted or cheated while on earth, assume the shape
of “ruru” and torment them severely. “Ruru” is a
kind of dreadful serpent. This hell is known as “Raura-
vam” because of the abundance of rurus there.
<div n="NI"/>(4) {%Mahārauravam.%} Here also there are ruru serpents.
Only they are of a fiercer type. Those who deny the
legitimate heirs, their inheritance and possess and enjoy
others’ property, are squeezed to death by these terrible
serpents coiling round them.
<div n="NI"/>(5) {%Kumbhīpākam.%} This is the hell for the punishment
of those who kill and eat birds and animals. Here, oil is
kept boiled in huge vessels. Yama's servants plunge
sinners into this oil. The period of their torture extends
to as many years as there were hairs on the bodies of
the birds or animals which they killed and ate.
<div n="NI"/>(6) {%Kālasūtram (Yamasūtra).%} This hell is terribly hot. It
is here that those who do not respect their father,
mother, elders, etc. are cast. They rush about in the
unbearable heat of this hell and drop down exhausted,
from time to time.
<div n="NI"/>(7) {%Asi(ta)patram.%} This is the hell in which those sinners
who abandon svadharma (one's own duty) and accept
Paradharma (others’ duty) are flogged by Yama's
servants with whips made of asipatra (sharp-edged
sword-shaped leaves). When they run about under
the flogging they trip over stones and thorns and fall on
[Page369-a+ 64]
their faces. Then they are stabbed with knives made of
asipatra. They drop down unconscious and when they
recover their senses, the same process is repeated.
<div n="NI"/>(8) {%Sūkaramukham.%} Kings who neglect their duties and
oppress their subjects by misrule, are punished in this
hell. They are crushed to a pulp by beating until they
fall down unconscious and when they recover, they
are again subjected to the same treatment.
<div n="NI"/>(9) {%Andhakūpam.%} This is the hell for punishing those
who oppress Brāhmaṇas, gods and the poor. In this
Kūpa (well) there are wild beasts like tiger, bear etc.
carnivorous birds like eagle, kite etc. venomous crea-
tures like snakes and scorpions and insects like bugs,
mosquitoes, etc. The sinners have to endure the cons-
tant attacks of these creatures, until the expiry of the
period of their punishment.
<div n="NI"/>(10) {%Kṛmibhojanam (Food for worms).%} Depraved Brāh-
maṇas who take their food without worshipping gods
and honouring guests, are thrown into this “Kṛmi-
bhojana” Naraka which is one lakh yojanas in extent.
Worms, insects and serpents sting them and eat them up.
Once their bodies are completely eaten up by these
creatures, they are provided with new bodies, which
are also eaten up in the above manner. They have to
continue there in this manner, till the end of their term
of punishment.
<div n="NI"/>(11) {%Taptamūrti.%} Those who plunder or steal other
people's gold, jewels, ornaments or money are cast
into the furnaces of this Naraka, which is built of iron
and always remains red hot with blazing fire.
<div n="NI"/>(12) {%Śālmali.%} This Naraka is intended for men and
women who have committed adultery. A figure made of
iron, heated red-hot is placed there. The victim is
urged to embrace it. Yama's servants flog the victim
from behind.
<div n="NI"/>(13) {%Vajrakaṇṭakaśāli.%} This Naraka is for the punishment
of those who have unnatural intercourse with cows and
other animals. Here, the guilty people are made to
embrace iron images full of diamond needles.
<div n="NI"/>(14) {%Vaitaraṇī.%} This is the Naraka for Kings who have
violated all ordinances of Śāstras and for adulterers. It
is the most terrible place of punishment. Vaitaraṇī is
a river filled with human excreta, urine, blood, hair,
bones, nails, flesh, fat and all kinds of dirty substances.
There are various kinds of ferocious beasts in it. Those
who are cast into it are attacked and mauled by these
creatures from all sides. The sinners have to spend the
term of their punishment, feeding upon the contents of
this river.
<div n="NI"/>(15) {%Pūyodakam.%} This is a well, filled with excreta,
urine, blood, phlegm etc. Brāhmaṇas and others who
have intercourse with women of low caste against
customs, ordinances etc. vagabonds who wander about
irresponsibly like animals and birds and other such
sinners are cast into this Naraka.
<div n="NI"/>(16) {%Prāṇarodham.%} This Naraka is for the punishment
of Brāhmaṇas who keep dogs, asses and other mean
animals and constantly hunt and kill animals for food.
Here the servants of Yama gather round the sinners and
cut them limb by limb with their arrows and subject
them to constant insult.
<div n="NI"/>(17) {%Viśasanam.%} This Naraka is for the torture of those
who perform Yāga by killing cows to display their
wealth and splendour. They will have to remain there
[Page369-b+ 64]
during the whole term of their punishment under the
constant flogging of Yama's servants.
<div n="NI"/>(18) {%Lālābhakṣam.%} This is the Naraka for lustful people.
The lascivious fellow who makes his wife swallow
semen, is cast into this hell. Lālābhakṣam is a sea of
semen. The sinner lies in it feeding upon semen alone.
<div n="NI"/>(19) {%Sārameyāśanam.%} Those guilty of unsocial acts
like incendiarism, poisoning food, mass slaughter,
ruining the country, etc. are cast into the Naraka
called Sārameyāśana. There, nothing but the flesh of
dogs is available for food. There are 700 dogs in that
Naraka and all of them are as ferocious as leopards.
They attack the sinners who come there from all sides
and tear their flesh from their bodies with their teeth.
<div n="NI"/>(20) {%Avīci.%} This Naraka is for those guilty of bearing
false witness, false swearing or assuming false names.
They are hurled into Avīci from a mountain which is
100 yojanas in height. The whole region of Avīci is
always shaken like an ocean with turbulent waves. As
soon as the sinners fall into it they are utterly smashed
into dust. They are again restored to life and the
punishment is repeated.
<div n="NI"/>(21) {%Ayaḥpānam.%} Those who belong to the first three
castes—viz. Brāhmaṇas, Kṣatriyas and Vaiśyas—who
indulge in drinking Soma, Surā etc. are bound and
thrown into this hell. They are forced to drink melted
iron in liquid form.
<div n="NI"/>(22) {%Kṣhārakardamam.%} Braggarts and those who insult
people of noble birth are cast into this hell. Here,
Yama's servants keep the sinners upside down and
torture them in various ways.
<div n="NI"/>(23) {%Rakṣobhakṣam.%} This Naraka is for the punishment
of meat-eaters. There are separate compartments in
this hell for those who perform human sacrifice, eat
human flesh or the flesh of other creatures. All the
living beings they had killed before, would have arrived
here in advance. They would all join together in
attacking, biting and mauling these sinners. Their
shrieks and complaints would be of no avail there.
<div n="NI"/>(24) {%Śūlaprotam.%} People who take the life of others
who have done no harm to them, by deceiving them
or by treachery, with weapons like the trident, are
thrown into the “Śūlaprotam” hell. Yama's servants
fix each of the sinners of the above class, on the top
of a trident. They are forced to spend the whole term
of their punishment in that position, suffering intense
thirst and hunger, enduring all the tortures inflicted on
them by Yama's servants.
<div n="NI"/>(25) {%Dandaśūkam.%} Sinners who persecute fellow
creatures like venomous serpents are cast into this
Naraka. There are many wild beasts and many hooded
serpents here. They eat alive, the sinners who fall into
this hell.
<div n="NI"/>(26) {%Vaṭarodham.%} This hell is for those who persecute
the creatures living on mountain-peaks, dense forests,
hollow trunks of trees, etc. It resembles mountains,
caves, forests etc. After throwing them into this hell
the sinners are tortured with fire, snake, poison and
weapons, just as they had tortured other creatures,
while on earth.
<div n="NI"/>(27) {%Paryāvartanakam.%} One who denies food to a
person who happens to come at meal-time and abuses
him, is thrown into this Naraka. The moment he falls
into it, his eyes are put out by being pierced with the
[Page370-a+ 64]
beaks of cruel birds like the crow, eagle etc. It is the
most painful experience for them.
<div n="NI"/>(28) {%Sūcīmukham.%} Proud and miserly people who
refuse to spend money even for the bare necessities of
life, find their place in this hell. Those who do not
repay the money they have borrowed, will also be cast
into this hell. Here, their bodies will be continually
pricked and pierced with needles. (Devī Bhāgavata,
8th Skandha; Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part 2, Chapter 6).
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Mantra (incantation) to invoke Yama.%}
<Poem>“Mahiṣastha Yamāgaccha
daṇḍahasta mahābala /
rakṣa tvaṃ dakṣiṇadvāraṃ
Vaivasvata namo'stu te”. //</Poem>
After invoking Yama with this mantra, one should
worship with the mantra “Vaivasvataṃ Saṃgamanam”.
(Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 56).
<div n="NI"/>13) {%Yama Defeated by Rāvaṇa.%} Once the sage Nārada
went to Rāvaṇa and expatiated on the glory and splen-
dour of Yama. Immediately Rāvaṇa set out to Saṃya-
manī with the intention of subduing Yama. Accepting
Rāvaṇa's challenge, Yama came out. After a terrible
battle between them, which lasted for seven days neither
of them was able to defeat the other. Both of them
had received Brahmā's boon. In the night of the
seventh day, Yama rushed forth with his staff to beat
Rāvaṇa to death. Then Rāvaṇa took his Brahmāstra.
At that critical moment, Brahmā came to the battle-
field and persuaded Yama to withdraw from the fight.
Yama retreated to his city and closed the gate.
Rāvaṇa went back with a triumphant shout. (Uttara
Rāmāyaṇa).
