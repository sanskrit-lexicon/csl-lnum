VAIŚĀLĀ¦. A city. This city was founded by King
Viśāla, who belonged to the dynasty of Diṣṭa. Because
Nābhāga, the son of Diṣṭa had married a woman from
Vaiśya caste, he also became Vaiśya. The writings of
Vatsa, the son of Bhalandana of this family, are included
in the Ṛgveda. The differentiation of castes was not so
strict in those days as today. It is not known in what
country Diṣṭa and his people Anagas lived. The Kings
Karandhama, his son Avikṣit and his son Marutta
of this dynasty were great and valiant. Marutta had
performed both horse sacrifice (aśvamedha) and impe-
rial consecration (Rājasūya). To Tṛṇabindu, who was
in the tenth generation from Marutta, a son was born
named Viśāla. This Viśāla founded a city and lived
there. That city is called Vaiśālā. Many of the scholars
are of opinion that this city Vaiśālā is the same
as Ujjayinī. It is stated in Mahābhārata that Soma-
datta of the seventh generation from Viśāla had per-
formed ten aśvamedhas (horse-sacrifices).
