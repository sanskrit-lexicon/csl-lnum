BRAHMĀSTRA¦. This is known by another name Brah-
maśirāstra also. This weapon was given to Agastya by
Śiva. It is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva,
Chapter 138, Stanza 9, that Agastya gave this weapon
to Agniveśa, who gave it to Droṇa and Droṇa gave it to
Arjuna and instructed him about the use of it as
follows:
<div n="NI"/>“You should never shoot this arrow at man. If it is
used against mean people the three worlds would be
destroyed. It is said that this weapon has no parallel
in the world. Keep this pure, and give ear to what I
say. If an enemy, other than human being attacks you,
this weapon may be used to kill him in battle.”
