KALKI¦. The tenth avatāra (incarnation) of Mahā-
viṣṇu. The ten avatāras are called Daśāvatāras.
Kalki is the last of them. Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 16
says as follows about the incarnation of Kalki:—
<div n="NI"/>Towards the end of Kaliyuga, all people will lose their
faith in God and become irreligious. They will accept
presents from the wicked. At that time, there will be
intermixture of castes. People will become thieves and
evil doers. Fifteen divisions of the Veda Vājasaneya
alone will become the authoritative document. People,
wearing the garb of righteousness, will indulge in
unrighteousness. Mlecchas (lowest class of people)
assuming the form of Kings will begin feeding upon
human beings. At that time Lord Viṣṇu will incarnate
as Kalki, the son of Viṣṇuyaśas and the priest of
Yājñavalkya and exterminate all mlecchas. He will
restore people to cāturvarṇya and the four āśramas and
maintain proper standards of conduct. Afterwards the
Lord will renounce the form of Kalki and ascend
Heaven. Then Kṛtayuga will begin again.
<div n="NI"/>Chapter 190 of Bhāṣā Bhārata supports almost all the
above statements. In the light of them, we can gather cer-
tain features of Kalki's incarnation when Kaliyuga reaches
its zenith. Mahāviṣṇu will be born as a Brāhmaṇa with
the name Viṣṇuyaśas, in the village called Śāmbhala.
Viṣṇuyaśaṣ will become famous under the name Kalki.
He will be the priest of Yājñavalkya. He will create arms
and soldiers by his will itself and destroy the wicked.
With that Kṛtayuga will commence.
<div n="NI"/>There is difference of opinion as to whether Kalki's
incarnation has passed or is yet to come. But in the
light of the statements in the Purāṇas, Kalki has not
yet come. Mahābhārata, Vana Parva, says that
Kaliyuga extends over a period of 4, 32, 000 years.
It is now only a little over 5,000 years since it began.
Still, more than 4, 26, 900 years have to pass before
the end of Kaliyuga. Therefore lakhs of years have
still to pass before the incarnation of Kalki.
