BHADRĀ VI¦. There is reference to another Bhadrā,
daughter of Soma in Chapter 154 of the Anuśāsana Parva.
She once did intense penance to secure Utathya as her
husband. Atri maharṣi, father of Soma, came to know of
the desire of his granddaughter, and got her married
to Utathya. Varuṇa once fell in love with Bhadrā, who
was an exceptionally beautiful woman, and abducted
and concealed her in the sea. When Utathya returned
to the Āśrama, his wife was missing. He understood
what had happened to Bhadrā by the light of his divine
knowledge (television of mind). Burning with anger
he drank up the sea completely dry, and Varuṇa shud-
dering with fear returned Bhadrā to Utathya and pro-
fusely apologised. Thus ended the problem.
