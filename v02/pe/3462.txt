KEKARALOHITA¦. A great serpent which once took
sage Cyavana to Pātāla. Cyavana, after worshipping
Śiva at Nakuleśvara tīrtha got into river Narmadā to
take his bath when the nāga called Kekaralohita
caught hold of him, dragged him and bit him. As
the sage meditated upon Viṣṇu the poison did not
affect him. The serpent released him from Pātāla as
he was unaffected by poison. Cyavana went to the
palace of Prahlāda accompanied by nāga damsels. On
the request of Prahlāda Cyavana described to him the
holy places on earth, and without any delay Prahlāda
came to earth for hunting during which sojourn on
earth he visited Naimiṣāraṇya. (Vāmana Purāṇa,
Chapter 8).
