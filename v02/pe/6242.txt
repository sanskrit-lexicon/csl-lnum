SAPTACARU¦. A holy place. The reason for giving this
place the name Saptacaru is given in Mahābhārata,
Vana Parva, Chapter 82 as follows:
<div n="NI"/>The word ‘Caru’ means sacrifice. Once devas (gods)
and men together put the fat parts of sacrificial animals,
as burnt offerings in the sacrificial fire, each singing
seven verses from the Ṛgveda. By this sacrifice they
obtained more prosperity than the fruits of giving one
lakh of cows as alms or performing hundred Rājasūya
sacrifices or thousand horse-sacrifices.
<div n="NI"/>“The wise said that it was an endless gift to the
manes. The gods, the manes, the Gandharvas, the
celestial maids, the gaṇas, the yakṣas, Kinnaras, the
siddhas, the Vidyādharas, the people of the earth, the
Rākṣasas, the daityas, the Rudras, Brahmā, all these
joined together with vow and fast taken for a thou-
sand years and performed a sacrifice each exalting
Viṣṇu by singing seven verses from Ṛgveda. Keśava
was much pleased at the caru and gave them Āṣtaiś-
varyasiddhi (the eight miraculous attainments) and
everything they wished. Thus giving them all kinds of
prosperities, the god Mukunda disappeared in this place
as lightning in the clouds. Therefore this place became
famous everywhere by the name Saptacaru.”
