AKṢAUHIṆĪ¦. A big division of an army. It is described
in the Verses 19 to 26 in the 2nd Chapter of Ādi Parva of
the Malayalam Mahābhārata. It says thus: One chariot,
one elephant, three horses and five soldiers constitute
what is termed a Patti. Three such pattis make one Senā-
mukha and three such senāmukhas make one Gulma.
Three gulmas make one Gaṇa and three such gaṇas
make one Vāhinī. Three such vāhinīs make one Pṛtanā.
An Akṣauhiṇī contains 21870 chariots, an equal number
of elephants, 65160 horses and 109350 soldiers.
