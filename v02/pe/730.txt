ĀNANDA¦ (CĀKṢUṢA). Son of Maharṣi Anamitra. It
was he who was born as Cākṣuṣa, the sixth Manu.
There is a story behind his birth. One day, while his
mother was keeping him in her lap and caressing him
the baby laughed and questioned “Oh mother why are
you caressing me, but look at those two cats. They
consider me as their food”. After some time one of the
cats took the child away and put it in the cradle of the
child of King Vikrānta. Vikrānta took the child as his
for granted and reared him. At the time of Upanayana
the King asked the boy to prostrate before his mother at
which the boy exclaimed “Oh King, I am not your son.
Your son is at some other place. By births and rebirths
all of us have many mothers and so it is better to be
above rebirths”. After having said so much Ānanda
went to the forest and started doing penance. Brahmā
appeared before him and blessing him said that he
would become the sixth Manu and lead the world to
righteousness. By the blessing of Brahmā Ānanda was
reborn as Cākṣuṣamanu. (See under Cākṣuṣa). (Mār-
kaṇḍeya Purāṇa).
