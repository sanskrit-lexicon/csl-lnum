INDRADYUMNA I¦. A King born in the dynasty of
Svāyambhuva Manu, and a king of the Pāṇḍya
country.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu in this order:—
Viṣṇu—Brahmā—Svāyambhuva Manu—Priya-
vrata—Agnīdhra—Nābhi—Ṛṣabha—Bharata—
Sumati—Indradyumna.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Indradyumna turned into elephant.%} Indradyumna, a
devotee of Viṣṇu handed over governance of the country
to his children when he became old, and performed
penance in the Malaya mountain. One day, when he
was immersed in meditation Agastya came there. Natu-
rally, Indradyumna did not notice Agastya's arrival.
Enraged at this the latter cursed Indradyumna and
turned him into an elephant. Being told immediately
about the curse by his servants Indradyumna sought
redemption from the curse from Agastya himself. Redemp-
tion was granted thus: Indradyumna would roam in
the forest for years as an elephant, a devotee of Viṣṇu
and he would attain salvation when Lord Viṣṇu came
down to the earth and patted the elephant on its back.
Accordingly Indradyumna who was turned into an ele-
phant roamed about in the forest for many years in the
company of a herd of wild elephants. At last it arrived
at Mount Trikūṭa. There was a lake there on the banks
of which was sage Devala engaged in penance. Hūhū,
the Gandharva had once come to this lake with a num-
ber of Apsarā women and they indulged in amorous
sports, which Devala did not like. He cursed Hūhū and
turned him into a crocodile, and the crocodile lived in
the same lake.
<div n="NI"/>Indradyumna who was turned into an elephant, stepped
into the lake to drink water when the crocodile caught
hold of its hind leg. Neither did the elephant yield nor
[Page329-a+ 65]
the crocodile leave the former free. Their tug of war
continued for 1000 years when Mahāviṣṇu appeared
on the scene, killed the crocodile and saved the
elephant. At once the elephant was re-transformed
into Indradyumna and he attained Vaikuṇṭha (the
abode of Viṣṇu). (Bhāgavata, 8th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>A Malayalam verse summarises the above story as
follows:—Impelled by Agastya's curse the elephant
went to the lake at Mount Trikūṭa, and suffered for
1000 years as the crocodile which caught hold of its
hind leg did not loosen its grip. Then appeared on the
scene the killer of Murāsura (Lord Viṣṇu) on his
vehicle, Garuḍa, killed the crocodile with his discus
and granted salvation to the elephant.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Indradyumna's fall from heaven when the merits of his good%}
{%deeds were exhausted.%} The merits or the result of his
good and noble deeds having been exhausted, Indra-
dyumna, the saintly king once descended from heaven
to earth, and the sad King approached sage Mārkaṇ-
ḍeya. But, the sage did not recognize him. The King
and the sage went to Prāvīrakarṇa, an owl living on
the top of the Himālayas. It also did not recognise the
King. Then they went to Nāḍījaṃgha, a stork very
much older than the owl and living in the lake known
as Indradyumna. Nāḍījaṃgha also could not recognise
the King. In another part of the lake was living a
tortoise called Akūpāra, who was older than Nāḍī-
jaṃgha. At last the King, the sage, Prāvīrakarṇa and
Nāḍījaṃgha approached Akūpāra. At his very sight
Akūpāra recognized the King. Akūpāra told sage
Mārkaṇḍeya that Indradyumna was a very famous
King and quite liberal and munificent in distributing
gifts, and that the lake Indradyumna was formed by
the passage of the cows gifted by the King. Having
heard these details regarding the King the sage sent
him back to heaven. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 199).
