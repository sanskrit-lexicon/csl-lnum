SIṂHIKĀ¦. A giantess. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter
15, and Agni Purāṇa Chapter 19). Two sons named
Hiraṇyakaśipu and Hiraṇyākṣa and a daughter named
Siṃhikā were born to Prajāpati Kaśyapa by his wife
Diti. Siṃhikā was married by Vipracitti. Two sons
named Rāhu and Ketu were born to them. Because
they were the sons of Siṃhikā, they came to be known
by the name Saiṃhikeyas.
<div n="NI"/>(But it is stated in Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter
65, that Siṃhikā was the daughter of Prajāpati Dakṣa
and the wife of Kaśyapa.)
<div n="NI"/>A story occurs in Rāmāyaṇa, that this Siṃhikā caught
hold of Hanūmān by his shadow and swallowed him,
while he was jumping to Laṅkā, and that Hanūmān
escaped from her. (See under Rāma, para 27).
