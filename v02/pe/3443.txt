KAUTSYA¦ (KAUTSA). A hermit who was the disciple
of Varatantu. When he had completed his education
he asked his teacher what gift he desired. The teacher
said that he wanted fourteen crores of gold coins as
gift. Kautsya approached the emperor Raghu. The
emperor had just finished a sacrifice called Viśvajit and
had emptied his treasury by giving away all the
wealth he had as alms. Only pots made of wood were
left as his wealth. When the emperor heard about the
need of Kautsya he decided to conquer the capital city
of Kubera. That night Kubera filled the treasury of
Raghu by a shower of gold. The emperor Raghu gave
Kautsya fourteen crores of gold coins. (Raghuvaṃśa).
