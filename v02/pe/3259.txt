KANYĀKUMĀRĪ¦ (KANYAKŪPA; KANYĀTĪRTHA)
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Mahābhārata makes references
in many places to Kanyākumārī, the southern extremi-
ty of former Kerala and Gokarṇa, the northern
boundary. It must, therefore, be surmised that these
two holy places were very ancient ones. Vana Parva,
praises Kanyākumārī at many places. If any one bathes
at this place one will become very famous. (Anuśāsana
Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>Chapter eighty-five of Araṇya Parva, of Bhāṣā Bhārata
speaks praisingly of Kanyākumārī and Gokarṇa among
other places. It says thus:
[Page386-b+ 63]
“If you visit Ṛṣabhācala of Pāṇḍyadeśa you will get the
benefit of conducting an Aśvamedhayāga. Then you
must go farther south and take a dip in Kanyātīrṭha.
The touch of that water absolves you of all sins. Then
visit Gokarṇa situated in the ocean famous in all the
three worlds and worshipped by all.”
<div n="NI"/>From this it is to be understood that ot the time of
Mahābhārata Kanyākumārī was part of Pāṇḍyadeśa
and that Gokarṇa was an island.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Purāṇic stories about Kanyākumārī.%} There are several
stories regarding the origin and renown of Kanyā-
kumārī in the Purāṇas. The most important ones are
given below.
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Absolver of sins.%} The wife of a brahmin named
Apañcika living in Kāśī became unchaste and to wash
away her sin she came to Kanyākumārī walking all
the way and did penance there, daily bathing in its
waters. She attained Salvation and it is believed that
a bath in its waters would absolve anybody of all his
sins. (Maṇimekhala).
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Cakra tīrtha of Kanyākumārī.%} Puṇyakāśī, daughter of
Mayāsura, once went to Kailāsa and worshipped Śiva.
After three yugas Śiva appeared before her and asked
her what she wanted. She replied that she wanted to
be merged in Śiva always. Śiva then said ‘Three
hundred and sixtyfive days would make a year. Four
lakhs and thirtythree years would make a Kali Yuga.
Kṛta, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali are four Yugas and
when two thousand such Yugas are over Brahmā
finishes a day. Such thirty days make one month and
twelve months, a year for Brahmā. When such hundred
years of Brahmā are over the great deluge comes. Such
ten deluges make a nāzhikā (twentyfour minutes) of
Viṣṇu. Counting thus when you pass ten Viṣṇu deluges
Śiva passes a second. Then is the time for the fulfil-
ment of your desire. Till that time you sit in medita-
tion on the shores of the south seas. Your hermitage
would be known as Kanyākṣetra or Tapaḥ Sthala.
During your stay there you must kill all the wicked
people like Bāṇāsura and give relief to the people. I
will also come and stay with you there then.”
<div n="NI"/>Puṇyakāśī after prostrating before Śiva went to the
south seas. Taking a Japamālā (necklace for prayer) in
her hands she assumed the name Kanyākumārī, and
started her penance. After conquering all the three
worlds demon Bāṇa was having a wicked rule over his
people when he saw Kanyākumārī and asked her to be
his wife. He approached her with his wicked servants
Durmukha and Durdarśana. But Kanyākumārī flatly
refused and in the battle that ensued, Bāṇāsura fell dead
by the Cakrāyudha (Discus) of Devī and at that spot
is the Cakratīrtha. (Skanda Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(3) The phantom child which escaped from the hands
of Kaṃsa at the time of the birth of Śrī Kṛṣṇa was that
divine lady Kanyākumārī. (Padma Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The Geographical view.%} It is said that there was an
extension of the present continent to the south and that
expansive land called Lamūria was later submerged in
waters. There is a description of such an extended land
in some of the old literature like Cilappadikāram.”
Kanyākumārī which was called ‘Kumāri-ambādi’ also
was the first setu; Dhanuṣkoṭi the middle setu; and
Koṭikkara, last setu. (Setu Purāṇa)
[Page387-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>4) {%In History.%} Kanyākumārī had attracted the atten-
tion of foreigners long before Christ. Herodotus who
lived in the third century B.C. has written about
Kanyākumārī in one of his books.
<div n="NI"/>In the book ‘Periplus’ written in 60 A.D. there is a
mention of Kanyākumārī. It says: “Pious persons at
the fag end of their lives dedicate their lives to God
and go to Kanyākumārī on a pilgrimage and stay there
accepting an ascetic life. A divine lady bathed in the
holy waters there grants you ‘darśana’.”
<div n="NI"/>Ptolemy another traveller who lived two thousand years
ago refers to Kanyākumārī in his book as ‘Komaria
Akron’. He had bathed in those waters and worshipped
in the Kanyākumārī temple.
<div n="NI"/>Marco Polo of Venice who had travelled these parts in
1243 A.D. has written of his worshipping in the Kanyā-
kumārī temple. He has also recorded having seen thirty
miles from Kanyākumārī a glittering figure like that of
the Pole-star.
<div n="NI"/>Ibn Batūtā who lived in 1203 A.D. has referred to
Kanyākumārī in his book as Rāskuṃhari.
