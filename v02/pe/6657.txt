ŚIVARĀTRĪ¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Śivarātrī is a holy day. Śivarātrī is observed
on the eve of New moon day (Caturdaśī) falling in the
middle of Māgha and Phālguna (February-March).
During this night, penance should be done with
fasting. On Caturdaśī day penance (vrata) should be
observed without sleep and food and Śiva worshipped.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Origin.%} There is the following Purāṇic story about
the origin of the observance of Śivarātri as a sacred day.
Brahmā took his birth in the lotus that originated from
the navel of Viṣṇu. Brahmā trying to know the source
of the lotus saw Viṣṇu only. He asked, ‘Who are you?’
and was answered ‘I am Viṣṇu, your father’. That
answer did not satisfy Brahmā and a quarrel ensued
between him and Viṣṇu which ended in fighting.
Brahmā shot the Brahmāstra, which Viṣṇu countered
with Pāśupatāstra and neither of the two was able to
withdraw it, which went round the world. While both
stood aghast not knowing what to do, Śivaliṅga appeared
betwixt the two. Both the ends of the liṅga were invisi-
ble. To find the ends Brahmā went upwards and Viṣṇu
downwards. Though they travelled a great distance
they could not find out the ends, and, so, returned to their
old seats. Immediately Śiva appeared betwixt the two
and withdrew the pāśupatāstra. It was on Caturdaśī day
in the month of Māgha that Śiva thus appeared. Śiva
enjoined that in future Caturdaśī night every year
should be observed as a holy day, which should be
known as Śivarātri. (Kaṇṇaśśa Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The greatness of Śivarātri.%} The following story about
a sinner, who attained Śivaloka by observing Śivarātri
is related in Śivarātrimāhātmya.
<div n="NI"/>A son named Sukumāra was born to the Brahmin mana-
ger of the king of Kuñjara, a kingdom on the banks of
river Sindhu. The boy grew up to be an immoral fellow
and he married a Caṇḍāla girl with whom he lived for
seven years. Five daughters and two sons were born to
him of the Caṇḍāla woman. The father, Sukumāra,
himself married the daughters. One day he, in the
course of his search for a flower to be worn on the hair
of the Caṇḍāla woman, came near the Śiva temple cal-
led Nāgeśvara. A Śivarātri festival was being cele-
brated there that day and Sukumāra, participated in it.
Shortly afterwards Sukumāra died. Messengers of Kāla
and Śiva arrived to carry off his soul and a battle
ensued between the two for the soul. His soul attained
Śivaloka as he had, though by accident, participated in
Śivarātri festival.
