MŪṢIKA¦. An ancient merchant. In the Kathāpīṭha-
lambaka of Kathāsaritsāgara a story is told to demon-
strate that even without any capital an ingenious and
industrious man can earn money.
<div n="NI"/>A merchant got this name by means of his industry.
Once a poor man of no resources went to the house of
a great merchant named Viśākhila. He was then ad-
monishing a young man of his own caste. The merchant
was saying, “See, here is a dead rat on the ground. A
clever man would earn money by using this as a capital.
To you I have given money for business on several
occasions. Not only that you have not increased it but
also you have lost it.”
<div n="NI"/>The poor man who went to him requested the merchant
to give him the dead rat. Viśākhila greatly amused at
the request gave him the rat. A rich man bought it for
his cat to eat and gave him instead two measures of
Bengal gram. He roasted it and made it palatable and
then with a pot of water went outside the city gates and
sat under a tree on the road-side. Wood-cutters were
passing that way carrying loads and he sold the
roasted gram and water to them who purchased it with
eagerness to ease their weariness. They gave him in
exchange firewood and in the evening he took it to
the market and sold it. With the money he purchased
more Bengal gram and continued the trade as before and
after a few days he purchased from them a great stock
[Page512-b+ 64]
of firewood. Suddenly there were heavy rains and there
was a scarcity of firewood in the market and he sold
his stock for good price. With the money thus received
he purchased some goods and started a grocery shop.
Gradually his business increased and he became a big
merchant. Because he started the business from a Mūṣika
(rat) he got the nick-name Mūṣika.
