DĪNANĀTHA¦. A King who lived in Dvāpara Age. He
was a mighty and famous Vaiṣṇava. But his childless
life distressed him very much. Once he consulted
Gālava about his plight. Gālava assured him that if he
performed a human sacrifice, a son would be born to
him. A handsome, scholarly and highly-born man was
to be sacrificed into the fire, A cripple, a dark-skinned
man or a crude fellow was unsuitable for the purpose.
The King's servants scoured the villages and towns
looking for such a perfect man, but in vain. At last
they reached a country called Daśapura, inhabited by
noble Brāhmaṇas. The women of that place were
reputed for their charming eyes. No man could resist
their fascination. In that lovely city there lived a
Brāhmaṇa named Kṛṣṇadeva with his virtuous wife and
three sons. The King's servants requested Kṛṣṇadeva
to give one of his sons to be sacrificed. They offered
four lakhs of gold coins as price. The Brāhmaṇa and
his wife cried bitterly and Kṛṣṇadeva offered himself
instead of his sons. The royal servants seized one of his
sons after throwing gold coins in the house and
prepared to take him away. At this stage the second
son of Kṛṣṇadeva came forward and volunteered
himself. They agreed and he accompanied them to the
palace. On their way they met the sage Viśvāmitra.
He asked them to release the boy but they refused to
set him free. The sage followed them to the palace and
undertook to perform a sacrifice which would bless the
King with progeny without a human sacrifice. The
King accepted the offer and thus the boy was saved.
