JYOTIṢA¦(M). (Astronomy and astrology). Jyotiṣa is
the science about the stars and heavenly bodies. The
heavenly bodies are the sun, the moon, the other
planets and the stars etc. From the very ancient days
men believed that these planets and stars in the sky
played an important part in controlling the growth
and activities of all the living and non-living things
in the world.
<div n="NI"/>Astrology has been a recognized science in Egypt, China
and India from very ancient days. History tells us that
3000 years before Christ there were astronomers in
Babylon. But even before that time astronomy had fully
expanded and grown in Bhārata.
<div n="NI"/>The Vedas are supposed to have six Aṅgas (ancillaries)
They are Śikṣā (Phonetics), Kalpa (ritual), Vyākaraṇa
(Grammar), Jyotiṣa (astronomy) Chandas (metrics),
and Nirukta (etymology). From this it can be said that
the Indians had acknowledged Astronomy as an anci-
llary of the Vedas. The expounders of the Vedas say
that Astronomy is the eye of the Vedas.
<div n="NI"/>Astronomy has two sides, the doctrinal side (Pramāṇa-
bhāga) and the result-side (Phalabhāga). The Calendar
is reckoned in accordance with the Pramāṇa-bhāga.
Prediction and casting horoscopes of living beings is the
Phala-bhāga.

<div n="NI"/>The astronomers have divided the sky that surrounds
the earth into twelve parts called rāś is (zodiacs). All
the stars of the first zodiac appear in the shape of a goat
(Meṣa) so that zodiac was called Meṣa. Thus the
zodiac in which the stars took the shape of an ox was
called Ṛṣabha (ox). In the zodiac Mithuna the stars
took the shape of a young couple. Karkaṭaka means
crab. In that zodiac the stars appear in the shape of
a crab. In the same way Siṃha means lion and Kanyā
means a damsel. Tulā means balance and Vṛścika
means scorpion; Dhanus means bow and Makara means
Makara matsya (horned shark). Kumbha is a water
pot and Mīna means fish. The name of the zodiac is
according to the sign of the zodiac. That is, in what
shape the stars in that particular zodiac appear to the
people of the earth. The figure of the twelve zodiacs
with the earth as centre is given below:—
<C n="1"/>Mīna <C n="2"/>Meṣa <C n="3"/>Ṛṣabha <C n="4"/>Mithuna
<C n="1"/>Kumbha <C n="2"/>Karkaṭaka
<C n="1"/>Makara <C n="2"/>Siṃha
<C n="1"/>Dhanus <C n="2"/>Vṛścika <C n="3"/>Tulā <C n="4"/>Kanyā
<div n="NI"/>In Kerala and some other places the zodiacs are marked
to the right in order beginning with Meṣa, whereas it is
marked to the left in the same order in some of the
other parts of India.
<div n="NI"/>The earth completes one rotation in 60 Nāḍikās (24
minutes) i.e. 24 hours. In each rotation these twelve
zodiacs face the earth. For a man standing at a parti-
cular point on the earth it will take 60% 12 i.e. 5
nāḍikās (two hours) on an average, for a zodiac to pass
him. But it may vary in different places according to
the difference of the shape of the earth. A month is the
time the sun remains in a zodiac. The planet Jupiter
takes a year and Saturn two years and a half on an
average to pass a zodiac. The calendar shows which
are the planets standing in each zodiac and how far
they have travelled at a particular time in that parti-
cular zodiac. When a particular zodiac is in a parti-
cular region of the earth, a man born in that region is
said to be born in that zodiac. When a particular
place faces the zodiac of Meṣa the child which takes
birth in that place is said to be born in the zodiac of
Meṣa. The zodiac of birth is given the name Lagna by
astronomers. Those who are well-versed in the result-
side of astronomy are of opinion that the life,
fortune etc. of living beings depend upon the position
of the planets in relation to their lagnas.
