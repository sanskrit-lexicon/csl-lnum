<div n="NI"/>2) {%How Ahalyā got a curse and became a stone.%} The story
of how Ahalyā was cursed by her husband, Gautama,
and was turned into a stone is told in different versions
in different purāṇas. The following is the version in the
Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa. When Viśvāmitra was taking back
Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa from the forest to the palace of
Janaka they came across an āśrama on their way. Giving
details about that āśrama Visvāmitra told the princes
thus: “This is the āśrama where the sage, Gautama, was
living with his wife, Ahalyā. Indra fell in love with the
beautiful Ahalyā and while the sage was out for bathing
Indra entered the āśrama in the disguise of the sage
himself and took bed with her. But before Indra could
get out Gautama himself came to the āśrama and en-
raged at what he saw, cursed them both. Indra was to
lose his testicles and Ahalyā was to turn into a stone.
But taking pity on her the sage declared that she would
take her original form the moment Rāma of tretā yuga
came to that place and touched the stone by his foot.
Testicleless Indra went to devaloka and there his friends
feeling sorry for him, substituted a goat's testicle and
got him to normal.” While Viśvāmitra was talking to
the princes, Śrī Rāma's foot touched the stone and Ahalyā
stood up in all beauty. Ahalyā and Gautama lived in
the same āśrama again for another long period.
<div n="NI"/>In Kathāsaritsāgara this story is told in a slightly diffe-
rent yet more interesting way. As soon as Gautama
entered the āśrama Indra turned himself into a cat.
Angrily the sage questioned Ahalyā, “who was standing
here when I came in?” Ahalyā replied, “Eso thiyo khu
majjara” (Eṣaḥ sthitaḥ khalu mārjjāraḥ). It was a cat
which was standing there. Here Ahalyā used a pun on
the word ‘majjara’ and tried to be honest. ‘Majjara’ is
the Prakrit form of the word ‘mārjjāraḥ’ which means cat.
But ‘majjara’ has another meaning also. (ma=mine
jāra=lover i.e. majjāra=my lover). So Ahalyā did not
lie to her husband. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Lāvānakalam-
baka).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%How Ahalyā happened to bring up the mighty monkeys, Bāli%}
{%and Sugrīva.%} Once Aruṇa, the charioteer of Sūrya (the
Sun) went to devaloka to see the dance of the celestial
maidens there. Since there was no admission to the dance
for men Aruṇa disguised himself as Āruṇidevī and sought
admission; seeing the beautiful form of Āruṇidevī Indra
fell in love with her and that night a child was born to
Indra by her. On the advice of Indra Āruṇidevī took the
child to Ahalyā before daybreak and left it there to be
looked after by her. It was this child which later on
became the famous Bāli.
<div n="NI"/>Aruṇa went a bit late that morning to his master, the
Sun. The latter wanted an explanation and Aruṇa told
him what had happened. The Sun then asked Aruṇa to
become Āruṇidevī again and seeing the enchanting figure
the Sun also got a child of her. This child also was taken
to Ahalyā and it was this child that later on became the
famous Sugrīva.
