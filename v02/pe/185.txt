AMARĀVATĪ¦. It is the city of Indra, the King of the
Devas. Its location is described in Devī Bhāgavata as
follows: “Brahmā's world extends over 10,000 yojanas
on the Mahāmeru mountain. There are eight cities—
each 2,500 square yojanas in extent—of the Aṣṭadik-
pālakas in eight parts of this Brahmapurī. Thus there are
nine cities on the top of the Mahā Meru. They are the
following:—
<div n="NI"/>1. In the centre is Brahmā's city, Manovatī.
<div n="NI"/>2. To the east of Manovatī, Indra's city, Amarāvatī.
