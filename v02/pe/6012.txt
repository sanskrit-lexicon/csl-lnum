SĀLVA II¦. There is a story in Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva,
stating that three Sālvas and four Madras were born
to Bhadrā from the dead body of her husband Vyuṣi-
tāśva. (See under Bhadrā II).
<div n="NI"/>Here, ‘Sālvas’ means the rulers of Sālva. It is stated in
Mahābhārata, Sabhā Parva, Chapter 14, Stanza 26 that
the people of Sālva fled to the south in fear of Jarā-
sandha. Satyavān, the husband of Sāvitrī, was a native
of Sālva. It is also mentioned that the soldiers of Sālva
who joined the army of the Kauravas fought against
the Pāṇḍavas. There were Sālva on the side of the
Pāṇḍavas also. Mention is made in Droṇa Parva,
Chapter 154, that the Sālvas on the side of the Pāṇḍavas,
attacked Droṇa, the teacher.
