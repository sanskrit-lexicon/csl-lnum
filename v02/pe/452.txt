ARUṆA I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Son of Kaśyapa by Vinatā. Kaśyapa, son
of Brahmā, married Vinatā and Kadrū, and being so
much pleased by their services he gave them boons.
Kadrū got the boon to have 1000 nāga (serpent) sons,
and Vinatā to have two sons more powerful and vital
than the sons of Kadrū. After this Kaśyapa went into
the forest again for Tapas. After a period, Kadrū gave
birth to 1000 eggs and Vinatā to two. Both the mothers
kept their eggs in pots so that they were in the right
temperature. After 500 years the pot broke up and
Kadrū had her 1000 sons. Vinatā felt pained at this
and opened one of her pots. A child only half-developed
emerged from the egg and he was Aruṇa. (M.B., Ādi
Parva, Chapter 16, Verses 5-7). After another 500
years the other egg of Vinatā hatched itself and a glow-
ing son emerged. He was Garuḍa.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Genealogy.%} While Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa wandered
in the forest searching for Sītā they saw the wounded
and disabled Jaṭāyu. Jaṭāyu described his genealogy
as follows: “Kaśyapa, son of Brahmā, married the
daughters of Dakṣa. Of the two wives, Vinatā delivered
two sons, Garuḍa and Aruṇa. Sampāti was Aruṇa's
elder son and he (Jaṭāyu) the younger. (Vālmīki
Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇyakāṇḍa, Canto 14). Agni Purāṇa,
Chapter 19 also refers to Garuḍa and Aruṇa as the sons
of Vinatā.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Aruṇa curses his mother.%} The fact of Vinatā forcing
open one of her eggs prematurely and Aruṇa emerging
out of it with only a half-developed body has been
mentioned above. Aruṇa got angry at the haste of his
mother and cursed her to live as slave of Kadrū for
500 years, and then Garuḍa would redeem her from
slavery. He also asked her to wait for 500 years so that
the birth of another physically deficient son like him-
self might be avoided. After pronouncing this curse Aruṇa
[Page055-b+ 65]
rose to the sky. This curse was the reason for Vinatā's
becoming a slave of Kadrū. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter
16, Verses 18-23).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Aruṇa became charioteer of Sun.%} The Sun and the
Moon betrayed to the Devas Rāhu, who waited at the
entrance of Devaloka to snatch off the Nectar (Amṛtam)
got at the churning of the sea of milk (Kṣīrābdhi).
Thenceforth Rāhu does often swallow the Sun and the
Moon. That phenomenon is called the eclipse (of the Sun
or Moon. Sūrya-grahaṇa and Candra-grahaṇa). Enraged
by these frequent attacks of Rāhu, the Sun-God began
once to burn like anything. Murmuring that everyone
would cooperate when there was something to be achiev-
ed, but would go on their own way when the object was
achieved, the Sun-God began burning so virulently as
to destroy all living forms, and the Devas were frighten-
ed by this and took refuge in Brahmā. Brahmā called
Aruṇa and asked him to stand as charioteer in front
of the Sun-God everyday so that the Sun's intensity
might be reduced. From that day onwards Aruṇa has
been functioning as the charioteer of the Sun. (M.B.,
Ādi Parva, Chapter 24, Verses 15-20).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Birth of sons.%} Śyenī, wife of Aruṇa delivered two
sons, Sampāti and Jaṭāyu. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter
68, Verse 71).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Aruṇa assumed female form.%} Śīlāvatī, the chaste
woman, once did naked Tapas to redeem her husband,
Ugratapas from the consequences of a curse. The object
of her tapas was to prevent the next dawn (Sunrise).
Owing to the intensity of her tapas the Sun ceased to
rise, and this gave his charioteer Aruṇa some rest. Then
it was that Aruṇa came to know of a programme of
naked dance by the women in Devaloka. Women alone
were admitted to the dance hall. Aruṇa, therefore, assum-
ed female form and sat among the Deva women, and
the beautiful ‘female’ kindled erotic sentiments in Indra
and he enjoyed a night with ‘her’. Also, a son was born
to them. And, before the day dawned Aruṇa, at the ins-
tance of Indra entrusted the child to Ahalyādevī and re-
turned to join duty as the Sun-God's charioteer. (Aruṇa,
while he acted as Indra's wife was called Āruṇīdevī).
Aruṇa was a bit late to report for duty, and when
questioned by Sun he detailed the happenings during
the last night. This evoked the desire in the Sun to see
Aruṇa in female form. Aruṇa did so, and the Sun en-
joyed her. This also resulted in the birth of a son, who
too was, at the instance of the Sun, entrusted to Ahalyā-
devī. Ahalyādevī brought both the children with tender
love, which Gautama muni, her husband did not like.
He cursed them and turned them into monkeys. After
some time Indra went to Ahalyā to see his child and he
was told the story of Gautama's curse. Indra searched
out both the monkeys. In view of the elder one having a
long tail he was called Bāli (Vāli) and the neck of the
second one being very beautiful, he was named Sugrīva.
At that time, Ṛkṣarāja, the monkey King of Kiṣkindhā
was very unhappy because he had no sons. He came to
know of Bāli and Sugrīva, and requested Indra to give
both the monkeys to him as sons. Indra gladly obliged
him. Indra blessed Bāli to the effect that half the
strength of anybody who attacked him would be added
to his own natural power. Indra then sent him and
Sugrīva to Kiṣkindhā.
