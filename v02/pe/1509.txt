CĀTURVARṆYAM¦. (The four Castes, Classes).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} The purāṇas tell that Brahmā created the
four castes like Brahmins, Kṣatriyas, Vaiśyas and Śūdras
and assigned to them duties and rules of procedure.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Origin.%} Brahmā got ready for the work of Crea-
tion, concentrating his mind on the universal soul, the
embodiment of Truth. And, the first to be born from his
face were people with sublime qualities, and them he
called Brahmins. Then emerged from his chest people
in whom the heroic or militant qualities preponderated.
(Rājasa). Them the Creator named Kṣatriyas. Then
from his thighs were born people in whom rajas and
tamas preponderated, and they were called Vaiśyas.
And, lastly Brahmā brought forth from his feet another
sect of people, and as tamas (darkness, cultural darkness)
preponderated in them they were named Śūdras. The
system of four castes is called Cāturvarṇyam. (Viṣṇu
Purāṇa, Part 1, Chapter 6).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Code of conduct.%} Ahiṃsā (non-violence), Satyavāda
(speaking truth), Bhūtadāya (love for all living beings),
Tīrthasevā (resort to holy places), Dāna (gifts), Brahma-
carya (celibacy), Vimatsaratva (absence of malice),
Service of Devas, Brahmins and Gurus (elders), to attend
to all dharmas (duties), Pitṛpūjā (worship of elders)
eternal loyalty to King, to accomplish objects in con-
formity with the injunction of the Śāstras, not to commit
cruel deeds, Titikṣā (forbearance, to put up with
equanimity the pair of opposites such as pleasure and
pain, heat and cold), belief in God—these codes of con-
duct are common to all Castes and in all the four stations
in life. Now, the special codes for each of the four
castes.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Brahmins.%} To perform and get performed Yajñas,
to study and to teach the Vedas, to give gifts and to
receive gifts—these form the dharma (duties) of the
Brahmin. Brahmins take their second birth (dvija)
on the upanayana (wearing of the sacred thread).
The caste of the mother is the caste of the child. But
children born to Brahmins of their non-Brahmin wives
are not Brahmins. Children born of a Brahmin woman
to a Śūdrā are called Caṇḍālas. Sons born of Brahmin
women to Kṣatriyas are called Sūtas, and sons born of a
Brahmin woman to a Vaiśya are called Vaidehikas.
The Brahmin shall not adopt the profession of the other
castes. The twice-born are, however, allowed in certain
circumstances, the profession of agriculture, protection
of cows, commerce and kusīda (to lend money on inte-
rest). But, he shall not trade in gorasa (milk and other
cow products) lavaṇa (salt) and flesh. If he be an
agriculturist, the Brahmin may till the earth, cut medi-
cinal plants and destroy pests. But, he must purify the
soul by performing yajñas and worshipping Devas.
The soil should be ploughed with eight oxen attached to
the plough. He may sustain himself either with Ṛta
(food got by begging) or Amṛta (food got not by beg-
ging). The suffix “Śarmā” should be added to the names
[Page180-b+ 64]
of Brahmin children. Upanayana (wearing of the sacred
thread) should be done when the child is eight years
old. The mauñji (girdle around the waist) to be worn
after upanayana should be made either of muñja grass
or of the bark of trees. Brahmin brahmacārins should
wear hides, and when they beg for alms the sentence
should commence with the word ‘Bhavati’, e.g. “Bhavati,
bhikṣāṃ dehi). The Brahmin can marry in all the castes,
but he shall perform ritual only along with the wife of
his own caste.
<div n="NI"/>{%ii) Kṣatriya.%} To give gifts according to rules, study
Vedas and perform yajñas form the duty of the Kṣatriya.
To look after and take care of good people and to punish
evil-doers are his especial duties. Names of Kṣatriya
children should take the suffix “Varmā”. After upana-
yana the child should wear tiger skin. He should carry
a daṇḍa (rod) of the Arayāl (peepal) tree. When the
Kṣatriya brahmacārin begs for alms the word ‘bhavati’
should be used in the middle of the sentence, e.g. “Bhikṣāṃ
bhavati dehi”. The Kṣatriya can marry in the other
castes, except the Brahmin. At the time of wedding the
Kṣatriya woman should hold an arrow in her hand.
<div n="NI"/>{%iii) Vaiśya.%} Agriculture, protection of cows and trade
are the special duties of the Vaiśya. Children born of
Brahmin women to Vaiśyas are called Vaidehikas.
Names of Vaiśya children should have the suffix ‘gupta’
after them. After upanayana the Vaiśya brahmacārin
should wear sheep's skin. He should carry a daṇḍa made
of a branch of the Kūvala tree. The Vaiśya may have a
wife of his own caste and one of the Śūdra caste. At
the time of wedding the Vaiśya woman should hold a
cane in her hand.
<div n="NI"/>{%iv) Śūdra.%} Service to the Brahmin and architecture
form the duties of the Śūdra. Children born to Kṣatriya
women by Śūdras are called Pulkasas. Children born
to Brahmin women by Śūdras are called Caṇḍālas,
and sons born to Śūdras by Vaiśya women are called
Āyogavas.
<div n="NI"/>The Caṇḍāla's profession is to hang criminals sentenced
to death, and to live by women. The Pulkasa must
live by hunting. Āyogava is to act on the stage and live
by architecture. The Caṇḍāla should live outside the
village. The Caṇḍāla has a right to take the clothes on
corpses. He shall not have any physical contacts with
the others. He will attain salvation if he died in the
course of protecting others. The suffix ‘dāsa’ should be
added to his name. He shall marry only from his own
caste. (Agni Purāṇa, 4 Chapters from 151).
