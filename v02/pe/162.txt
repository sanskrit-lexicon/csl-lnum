ALAMBALA¦. A giant who used to eat human flesh.
This cannibal was the son of Jaṭāsura. This asura
(Alambala) fought on the side of the Kauravas in the
Kurukṣetra battle because Bhīmasena had killed his
father, Jaṭāsura. In the battle, Ghaṭotkaca cut off the
head of this mighty warrior and magician and threw his
head into the war-chariot of Duryodhana. (M.B., Droṇa
Parva, Chapter 149).
