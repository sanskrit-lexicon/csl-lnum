<div n="NI"/>2) {%Name.%} His actual name was Mitrasaha. Since he
was the son of Sudāsa, he was called Saudāsa also.
[Page377-a+ 64]
(M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 78). Kalmāṣāṅghri
and Kalmāṣapāda were names which he got as a result
of Vasiṣṭha's curse.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Mitrasaha became a Rākṣasa.%} Mitrasaha was a re-
puted and glorious king belonging to the solar dynasty
of kings who ruled over Ayodhyā. He had a queen
named Madayantī. While they were leading a happy
and enviable married life, Mitrasaha was forced to
lead the life of a Rākṣasa in the forest for a period of
12 years, as the result of a curse. The story of this
curse is given in different Purāṇas in different versions
and they are given below;—
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Śakti Cursed Mitrasaha.%} One day Mitrasaha went to
the forest for hunting. Viśvāmitra wished to get this
mighty King as his disciple. While the King was
passing through the forest, he saw Śakti, Vasiṣṭha's son,
coming towards him. The King was a Kṣatriya and
Śakti was a Brāhmaṇa. They were faced with the
problem of whether the Kṣatriya should make way for
the Brāhmaṇa or vice versa. Neither of them made way
for the other. At last, Mitrasaha struck Sakti with his
whip. In his anger Śakti cursed Mitrasaha that he
should become a Rākṣasa and roam about in the forest
for 16 years. Viśvāmitra who was standing nearby at
the time introduced a devil into the body of the King
and from that day Mitrasaha wandered about in the
forest in the form of a Rākṣasa. (M.B. Ādi Parva,
Chapter 176).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Vasiṣṭh cursed Mitrasaha.%} Mitrasaha once went to hunt
in the forest. While hunting he came across two tiger
cubs. Actually, they were two Rākṣasas in disguise.
The King who was unaware of it, killed one of them
with an arrow. The other cub suddenly assumed his
own form as a Rākṣasa and after giving Mitrasaha a
warning that he would take revenge on him at the
proper time, vanished.
<div n="NI"/>After the hunt the King returned to his palace. He
informed Vasiṣṭha that he wished to perform Aśva-
medhayāga like his ancestors. The sage offered to assist
him in it. Shortly after, one day, the old Rākṣasa-tiger,
disguising himself as the sage Vasiṣṭha, came to Mitra-
saha and said;— “Oh King! I will tell you a secret.
Don't tell anyone else. I have a great desire to eat
meat food. Please send some cooked meat to my Āśrama
without anyone knowing about it.” After saying this,
the disguised Rākṣasa-sage left the place.
<div n="NI"/>The King told this secret to his wife Madayantī. They
prepared the meat-food secretly and took it to Vasiṣṭha's
Āśrama. When Vasiṣṭha saw the meat food, he took it
as a personal insult and transformed the King into a
Rākṣasa. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Another story of Vasiṣṭha's curse on Mitrasah.%} Once
while Mitrasaha was hunting in the forest, he happened
to kill a Rākṣasa by accident. The dead Rākṣasa's
younger brother swore to avenge his death. He went to
the King in the disguise of a young Brāhmaṇa cook.
Mitrasaha appointed him as a cook in the royal
kitchen.
<div n="NI"/>At about that time, one day, Vasiṣṭha came to Ayodhyā,
on the invitation of Mitrasaha for a Śrāddha. Mitra-
saha, accompanied by his queen, greeted the sage with
honour. He ordered the cook to prepare food for the
guest at once. The Rāksasa disguised as cook, decided
to make the best of this opportunity. In a short time
[Page377-b+ 64]
he cooked some human flesh and offered it as food for
Vasiṣṭha. The enraged sage cursed the King to become
a man-eating Rākṣasa who would roam about for twelve
years in the woods. Thus Mitrasaha became a Rākṣasa.
(Śiva Purāṇa, Śivarātri Māhātmya).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%How Mitrasaha got the name “Kalmāṣapāda.”%} Mitra-
saha became very angry when he was cursed by
Vasiṣṭha. He decided to pay back in the same coin by
cursing Vasiṣṭha also. He took water in his hand and
was about to throw it down with the words of curse.
But his queen Madayantī stopped him. She reminded
him that it was not right to curse a Brāhmaṇa and
requested him to sprinkle that water on his own feet.
The King's anger cooled down and he sprinkled the
water on his own feet. Since his feet were polluted by
the water of sin Mitrasaha came to be called “Kalmā-
ṣapāda”, and Kalmāṣāṅghri” from that day. (Śiva
Purāṇa, Śivarātri Māhātmya).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Kalmāṣapāda's life as Rākṣasa.%} The curse-ridden
Kanmāṣapāda began to look upon Vasiṣṭha and his
sons with inveterate hatred. He roamed the country-
sides and forests in the form of a Rākṣasa. He started
man-eating by feeding upon Śakti, the eldest son of
Vasiṣṭha. After that he ate all the remaining 99 sons
of Vasiṣṭha. Distreseeḍ at the loss of his children,
Vasiṣṭha left his Āsrama, bent on committing suicide.
He tied his own hands and feet securely with a rope and
jumped into the river to drown himself. This attempt,
like several other attempts to commit suicide, failed
and he did not die. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 177).
In the Mahābhārata there is a story which says that
once Uttaṅka, a disciple of the sage Gautama went to
beg the Kuṇḍalas (ear ornaments) worn by Kanmāṣa-
pāda's (Saudāsa's) queen, for the sake of Gautama's
wife. (For details, see under the word “Uttaṅka”).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Brāhmaṇī's curse on Kalmāṣapāda.%} In the course of
his wanderings through the forest as a Rākṣasa, Kalmā-
ṣapāda happened to come across a Brāhmaṇa youth
engaged in amorous pleasures with his wife Āṅgirasī.
The King caught hold of the youth and killed him. His
wife, the Brāhmaṇī wept loudly and after cremating her
husband's body in a funeral pyre, jumped into it and
burnt herself to death. Just before her death she pro-
nounced a curse on Kalmāṣapāda that if he touched
any woman in future he would die immediately.
<div n="NI"/>After the death of the Brāhmaṇa couple, the sin of
Brahmahatyā (killing of Brāhmaṇa) continued to pur-
sue Kalmāṣapāda in the form of a terrible monster.
He fled for life from it and at last reached the pre-
sence of King Janaka. There, he happened to see the
sage Gautama who taught Kalmāṣapāda Divyajñana
(Divine wisdom). As advised by the sage, he went to
the temple at Gokarṇa and spent some years in deep
meditation. (Śiva Purāṇa, Śivarātri Māhātmya).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Śāpamokṣa. (Liberation from Curse).%} Towards the
close of the twelve years which Mitrasha (Kalmāṣa-
pāda) spent as a Rākṣasa, Vasiṣṭha saw him. The sage
sprinkled holy water on Mitrasha and at once the
Rākṣasa (the spirit of the Rākṣasa) left his body and he
resumed his original figure of the King. He accepted
Vasiṣṭha as his preceptor. They went back together to
Ayodhyā.
<div n="NI"/>Although Madayantī, queen of Mitrasaha was there, the
King was not able to touch her owing to the Brāhmaṇī's
[Page378-a+ 64]
curse. So he requested Vasiṣṭha to beget children by
her. Accordingly Madayantī became pregnant by
Vasiṣṭha. But she did not deliver the child even after
twelve years. At last she hit the embryo in her womb
with a stone and the child was born. Since he was born
with the help of a stone (Aśman), the child was named
“A maka”. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 167).
