RAMYAKA II¦. A particular region in Ilāvṛta, one
of the seven Continents. On the eastern part of Ilāvṛta
there exist three mountains called Nīlagiri, Śvetagiri and
Sṛṅgavān. These mountains jut into the sea, and are
separated from one another by a distance of two thou-
sand miles each and are the source of many rivers. In
between the three mountains are three regions of land
called Ramyaka, Hiraṇmaya and Kuru. (Devī Bhāga-
vata, 8th Skandha).
