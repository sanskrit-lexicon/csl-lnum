DAKṢA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Two Dakṣas.%} In most of the Purāṇas references
about two Dakṣas occur. In some purāṇas both are
referred to as one and the same person, whereas in
some others both are considered as separate persons,
so much so the stories concerning both are interlocked
and entangled very often. The fact is that there was
only one Dakṣa, whose life was of two stages. The first
Dakṣa was killed at the sacrifice of Dakṣa, at which point,
ends the first stage, or the first Dakṣa. The second stage
was the rebirth of the same Dakṣa. A short biography
of Dakṣa including both stages is given below:—
<div n="NI"/>Brahmā created by his mind, the seven great hermits,
Marīci, Aṅgiras, Atri, Pulastya, Vasiṣṭha, Pulaha and
Kratu. So these seven hermits are called the Mānasa-
putras (sons born from mind) of Brahmā. After this,
from the anger of Brahmā, Rudra was born, and from
his lap Nārada, from his right thumb Dakṣa, from
his mind the Sanakas and from his left thumb a daughter
named Vīraṇī were born.
<Poem>Vīraṇī nāma tasyā stu
asiknītyāpi sattamā</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>From this passage which occurs in Kālikā Purāṇa it
may be assumed that ‘Asiknī’ was another name of
Vīraṇī. Dakṣa did penance in the mountain of Vindhya
for a long time. It is mentioned in Bhāgavata, Skandha
8, that Mahāviṣṇu appeared before Dakṣa and gave
him Asiknī as his wife.
<div n="NI"/>Several sons were born to Dakṣa by his wife Asiknī.
The last one was a daughter named Satī who became
the wife of Śiva. At this time Dakṣa performed a sacrifice.
As he was not invited to that sacrifice, Śiva sent
Vīrabhadra and Bhadrakālī and killed Dakṣa. Though
the devas put the head of a goat in place of the lost
head and brought Dakṣa to life again, no reference
is made about the life of Dakṣa after the sacrifice. Thus
the first stage of the life of Dakṣa ends. (Devī Bhāga-
vata, Skandha 7).
<div n="NI"/>After this, once the Pracetases (the ten sons of Barhis)
were engaged in penance and the earth was not pro-
perly cultivated in consequence of which big trees
[Page193-a+ 65]
grew up and the whole of the earth was changed into
a big forest. The sky was covered with tree tops. It
was difficult even for the wind to pass through them
and thus the forest thrived for ten thousand years. The
pracetases got out of the sea after penance and entered
the shore. When they saw the big forest they got angry
and the ten of them discharged fire and wind from
their faces. The wind up-rooted the trees and the fire
dried them. Thus almost the whole of the trees were
consumed. Then Candra, the King of the medicinal
herbs came there and told the Pracetases “Oh, Kings,
hold your anger. I will make the trees conclude a
treaty with you. The beautiful Māriṣā who was born
to the trees is my foster-daughter. I give her to you
as your wife. From half the portion of your minds
and half the portion of my mind the great and wise
prajāpati Dakṣa is going to take birth in her womb”.
<div n="NI"/>The Pracetases controlled their anger and accepted
Māriṣā as their wife, at the words of Somadeva (Candra)
and as the son of the ten pracetases the Prajāpati Dakṣa
was born. With this the second stage of the life of Dakṣa
begins. The important occurrences in the two stages
of the life of Dakṣa are given below in their order.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Dakṣa's creation of the prajas or subjects.%} Once Brahmā
called Dakṣa and ordered him to create prajās or sub-
jects. Accordingly Dakṣa created the gods, the hermits,
the Gandharvas (Demi-gods), the Asuras, the serpents
etc. Seeing that the subjects he created were not pro-
liferating as required he thought of creating subjects
by coition of male and female; and he begot by his
wife Asiknī five thousand sons, and they were called
Haryaśvas. They in their turn were about to create
subjects when Nārada appeared before them and said
“Oh, Haryaśvas, you are mere children and ignorant
of the secrets of this world. How do you intend to
create subjects? You fools, since you have the power
to go up and down and lengthwise and breadthwise,
why don't you try to find out the extremities of the
earth?” Hearing the words of Nārada, they all ran
in different directions and have not returned since.
Thus Dakṣa lost the Haryaśvas. Dakṣa again begot
thousand sons by Asiknī and they were called Śabalāśvas.
Seeing that they also were about to create subjects
Nārada scattered them also, by some tricks. The
Śabalāśvas who had gone to see the end of the earth
have not yet returned.
<div n="NI"/>Dakṣa got angry with Nārada and cursed him thus:
“You also, like my children shall wander from place
to place all over the earth”. From that dry onwards
Nārada became a wanderer, without a fixed dwelling
place. The wise Prajāpati Dakṣa again begot sixty
damsels by Asiknī. Ten of the girls were given to Dharma-
deva, thirteen of them to Kaśyapa, twentyseven of
them to Soma, and four of them to Ariṣṭanemi. Of
the rest two were given to Bāhuputra, two to Aṅgiras
and two to the wise Kṛśāśva. The names of the wives
of each are given below:—

<div n="NI"/>The names of the wives given to Aṅgiras, Ariṣṭanemi,
Bāhuputra and Kṛśāśva are not mentioned.
<div n="NI"/>Besides these damsels, twentyfour daughters were born
to Dakṣa of his wife Prasūti who was the sister of Uttāna-
pāda. Dharmadeva married thirteen of them also, named
Śraddhā, Lakṣmī, Dhṛti, Tuṣṭi, Medhā, Puṣṭi, Kriyā,
Buddhi, Lajjā, Vapus, Śānti, Siddhi, Kīrti. Of the rest,
Khyāti was given to Bhṛgu, Satī to Śiva, Saṃbhūti to

to Pulaha, Santati to Kratu, Anasūyā to Atri, Ūrjā
to Vasiṣṭha, Svāhā to Agnideva and Svadhā to the
Manes. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter 15).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Sacrifice of Dakṣa.%} Once Dakṣa performed a sacri-
fice called Bṛhaspatisavana. To this sacrifice he did not
invite his daughter Satī or her husband Śiva. Dakṣa
did not invite them because of three reasons according
to the Purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>(1) Once Durvāsas, the son of Atri, went to Jambūnada
and meditated with the mantra or spell of ‘Māyābīja’
and worshipped Jagadambikā (mother of the
world) the goddess there. The goddess was much plea-
sed and gave him as a token of her pleasure the garland
of flowers she wore from which nectar was oozing.
Durvāsas wore it on his head and went to the palace of
Dakṣa, the Prajāpati. When he saw such a wonderful
garland which was not of this world, he wanted to have
it and Durvāsas instantly gave it to Dakṣa. He placed it in
a prominent place in his bedroom and enjoying the
wonderful fragrance of it he conjugated with his wife,
and polluted that pure garland by his lust. Śiva and his
wife came to know of this and they scolded Dakṣa, who
kept this bitterness in his heart and when the sacrifice
was performed, he decided not to invite them. (Devī
Bhāgavata, Skandha 7).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Śiva was considered as a polluted man by Dakṣa
as he had always been carrying with him the skull of
Brahmā and so he thought it wrong on his part to admit
his daughter and son-in-law to the sacrificial hall. The
story of how Śiva came to have the skull, is given below.
<div n="NI"/>In days of old when the whole world was under the
single ocean (of the great flood) the sun, the moon, the
fire, air everything was destroyed and darkness pre-
vailed. All the vegetations were destroyed. All the
emotions and non-emotions disappeared. The supreme
Lord was sleeping for so many thousands of nights
together. At the end of the night he assumed the attri-
bute of ‘Rajoguṇa’ (activity) and got ready to create
the universe. From the face of the Supreme Lord and
creator of the universes came out Brahmā with five faces.
In the same way, Śiva with three eyes and matted hair,
and trident and rosary of beads (Elaeo carpus) and with
attribute of ‘Tamas’ (darkness—destruction) also came
out. Both Brahmā and Śiva were filled with egoism and
both began to quarrel with each other. It was a contest
as to who was greater. The contest ended in attack.
Śiva plucked off the fifth head of Brahmā, when the
same face, flushed with anger, scolded Śiva. The head
fell into the hands of Śiva, who could not throw it down
as it didn't come off from his hand. Brahmā cursed
Śiva and made him polluted. Since Śiva became polluted,
[Page194-a+ 64]
his wife Satī also was considered as polluted by Dakṣa.
(Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 2).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Once the prajāpatis performed a sacrifice. Brahmā,
Viṣṇu and Śiva were present there. Dakṣa, who had been
invited by the prajāpatis also was present. When Dakṣa
entered the hall his son-in-law Śiva did not rise up.
This arrogance of Śiva made Dakṣa angry. Dakṣa made
up his mind to take vengeance on Śiva, and performed
a sacrifice known as Bṛhaspatisavana. To that sacrifice
he did not invite Śiva or Satī.
<div n="NI"/>Hearing that her father was conducting a sacrifice Satī
came uninvited. But Dakṣa did not even look at her.
Satīdevi whose heart was broken at this treatment made
a fire and jumped into it and died. Śiva became furious
when he came to know of this. Being overwhelmed with
sorrow and anger he beat his matted hair on the ground,
from which two monsters, Vīrabhadra and Bhadrakālī,
came out. They ran to Dakṣa's sacrificial hall and des-
troyed everything they saw, killed everybody, caught
hold of Dakṣa and cut off his head. Then they began to
create havoc in the whole world. The hermits and
sages began to take to flight. Men and animals shivered.
Thus the three worlds began to tremble with fear. The
gods approached Śiva with supplication to curb his
anger. The gracious Śaṅkara was pleased to recall the
monsters. After that everybody requested him to bring
Dakṣa back to life. But the search made for the head of
Dakṣa was futile. At last Brahmā took the head of a
goat and joined it to the headless trunk of Dakṣa. Thus
he was brought to life again.
<F>1. Though Dakṣa was brought to life again with the head of a goat there is no mention of him again in the Purāṇas. We hear of
Dakṣa again as the son of Māriṣā.</F> (Devī Bhāgavata,
Skandha 7).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Cursing Candra.%} Candra had married twentyseven
daughters of Dakṣa. But he showed particular attach-
ment to Rohiṇī. The other twentysix wives could not
bear this. They made a complaint to their father Dakṣa.
Dakṣa called Candra and advised him to show equal
attachment to all his wives and not to show any partia-
lity to anyone. Candra did not gainsay his father-in-
law, but he did not make any change in his disposition.
After a few days all the daughters except Rohiṇi went
to the palace of Dakṣa and told him that they were
going to stay with him. This time Dakṣa got angry and
called Candra and cursed him to become a sick man
(of consumption).
<div n="NI"/>From that day onwards Candra became a patient affec-
ted with consumption. All the vegetations in the world
began to weaken. It appeared that the world was
about to be destroyed. So the gods approached Dakṣa
and requested him to show some leniency towards
Candra. Dakṣa accordingly called Candra and told
him that he would be affected by consumption only for a
fortnight and after that he would recover gradually.
Candra went to Prabhāsa tīrtha and Sarasvatī tīrtha and
dipped in water. He began to recover from that day.
It is according to the curse of Daksa that Candra (Moon)
waxes and wanes. (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 35).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Other information.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) Dakṣa has another name ‘Kan’.
“Dakṣa the Prajāpati is a son of ten fathers. He has
two names. They are Dakṣa and Kan.” (M.B. Śānti
Parva, Chapter 208, Stanza 7).
<div n="NI"/>(2) When the emperor Pṛthu milked the earth, Dakṣa
[Page194-b+ 63]
was crowned as the King of the subjects. (See under
Pṛthu).
<div n="NI"/>(3) It occurs in Mahābhārata, Sabhā Parva, Chapter
11, Stanza 18, that Dakṣa was a member of the assembly
of Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>(4) Dakṣa was one of those who visited Bhīṣma in his
bed of arrows. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 47).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Mention is made in Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva,
Chapter 166 that the devas, the manes, the gandharvas,
the celestial maids, the Rākṣasas, animals and birds,
fishes and all living creatures were born from the daugh-
ters of Dakṣa.
