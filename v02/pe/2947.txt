JAYADEVA I¦. A Sanskrit poet who lived in the 13th cen-
tury A.D. He is the author of the play ‘Prasannarāgha-
vam’. As far as the story of Śrī Rāma is concerned,
some changes have been made in this play from that
given by Bhavabhūti in his ‘Mahāvīracarita’. Accord-
ing to this play Śrī Rāma and Bāṇāsura both were
lovers of Sītā. The famous work ‘Candrāloka’, a trea-
tise on rhetorical figures, was written by this poet Jaya-
deva. His most important work is ‘Gītagovinda’, the
theme of which is the early life of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, especially
the love between Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā, which is very
touchingly described. This book consists of 12 sargas
and each sarga contains 24 octaves. This poet was a
devotee of Kṛṣṇa. He used to sing lyrics before the
image of Kṛṣṇa while his wife danced according to the
beat.
