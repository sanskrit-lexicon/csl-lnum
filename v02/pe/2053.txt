ḌIBHAKA¦. A prince who, puffed up by the power of
boons and blessings from the gods, tried to harm sage
Durvāsas. Balabhadrarāma killed him. The following
account occurs in the Bhaviṣya Purāṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Brahmadatta, King of Sālva, had two wives. No chil-
dren were born to them for several years. Brahmadatta's
minister, Mitrasaha, also had no children. Mitrasaha
was a brahmin and a scholar. On his advice, Brahma-
datta, with his wives, went to Kailāsa and performed
tapas to please Śiva to get children. As a result of ten
years’ rigorous tapas Śiva was pleased and blessed
him that two sons would be born to him. Later his
wives gave birth to two sons. The son of the eldest
queen was named Haṃsa and that of the second queen
was named Ḍibhaka. At this time a son was also born
to Mitrasaha, the minister by the blessing of Viṣṇu. That
child was named Janārdana.
<div n="NI"/>Haṃsa and Ḍibhaka were spoilt, but Janārdana was
a bhakta of Viṣṇu. Haṃsa and Ḍibhaka performed
tapas in their childhood to please Śiva and got invinci-
ble power and arrows. After that they became loka-
kaṇṭakas (torturers) and went round the world. Once
they went to Kaśyapa's āśrama and destroyed the place
of worship. After that they went to the āśrama of
Durvāsas. There they tortured the sages and made the
sages naked who were wearing only loin cloth. Then
they returned.
<div n="NI"/>Enraged by these, sage Durvāsas went to Dvārakā
taking the destroyed loin-cloth and other articles. Śrī
Kṛṣṇa and his courtiers stood up and saluted him when
they saw Durvāsas coming like saṃhārarudra. On
hearing the news, Śrī Kṛṣṇa assured him that he would
kill Haṃsa and Ḍibhaka and sent him back pacified.
<div n="NI"/>Haṃsa and Ḍibhaka began a rājasūya. They sent
Janārdana to Śrī Kṛṣṇa with the message that he should
[Page241-b+ 63]
either fight with them or give them tribute (in the
form of money). Janārdana went to Dvārakā, just as
Akrūra, a devotee of Viṣṇu, went to Ambāḍi with the
message of Kaṃsa. Immediately Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadra
with the chief Ministers like Sātyaki went to Sālva. In
the war that followed Śrī Kṛṣṇa killed Haṃsa and Bala.
Bhadrarāma killed Ḍibhaka. (M.B. Bhaviṣya Parva,
Chapter 103-129).
