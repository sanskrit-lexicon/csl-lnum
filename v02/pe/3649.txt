<div n="NI"/>1). {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus: Brahmā-
Atri—Candra—Budha—Purūravas—Āyus—Nahuṣa—
Yayāti—Puru—Janamejaya—Prācinvān—Pravīra—
Namasyu—Vītabhaya—Śuṇḍu—Bahuvidha—Saṃyāti—

Bṛhatkṣetra—Hasti—Ajamīḍha—Nīla—Śānti—Suśānti—
Puruja—Arka—Bhavyāśva—Pāñcāla—Mudgala. A dau-
ghter called Ahalyā was born to Mudgala. Maharṣi Gau-
tama married her. To Gautama was born Śatānanda, to
him Satyadhṛti, to him Śaradvān and to Śaradvān was
born Kṛpācārya. The Purāṇas refer to the generation
preceding Gautama only in the maternal line. It is said
in verse 2, Chapter 130 of the Ādi Parva, that Śaradvān
was the son of Gautama. According to Agni Purāṇa,
Bhāgavata etc. Śaradvān, father of Kṛpa was the son
of the great-grand son of Gautama and grandson of
Śatānanda. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 278).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth of Kṛpa.%} Though born in a family of Sages
Śaradvān evinced more interest in Dhanurveda. He
performed penance in the forest, with bow and arrows
deposited by his side. As his penance gathered intensity
the Devas got alarmed. To break his penance Indra
deputed the Devatā called Jānapadī to the earth and
she appeared before Śaradvān and danced, dressed only
in one piece of cloth. Emission occurred to him. But,
wisdom dawned on him immediately and leaving behind
him the bow, arrows and deer skin he quitted the
place.
<div n="NI"/>The semen discharged by him fell on the arrow which
broke into two giving birth to a male child and a
female one.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Kṛpa in the Palace.%} One of the attendants of King
Śantanu, who had come to the forest to hunt, saw the
children and took them to the King. The King felt Kṛpā
(pity) for them and brought them up in the palace
and as they were thus brought up due to his Kṛpā they
came to be called Kṛpa and Kṛpī. (Ādi Parva, Chapter
130).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Kṛpa's mastery of Dhanurveda.%} While living in the
forest engaged in penance Śaradvān, with his divine
power understood that the two children forsaken by
him were growing up in the palace. He went to the
palace and told the king details about the children. He
also lived there in secret and taught Kṛpa everything
contained in the four branches of Dhanurveda and the
various usages in archery. Gradually Kṛpa became an
ācārya (master) in Dhanurveda. Not only the Pāṇḍavas
the Kauravas, the Yādavas and the Vṛṣṇis but also
kings, who came from various regions of the country
learned archery at the feet of Kṛpa. (Ādi Parva, Chapter
130, Verse 23).

for them. Spectators crowded to see it. Droṇa, Kṛpa,
Somadatta, Bālhīka, Bhīṣma and Vidura and other
great ones took their seats in the stadium. Arjuna and
Karṇa entered the arena for contest when Kṛpa inter-
vened and said that Arjuna was the youngest son of
Kuntī but Karṇa should specify his parentage. At this
