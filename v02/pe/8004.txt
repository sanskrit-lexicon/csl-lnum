VAPUṢMĀN¦. Son of Saṅkrandana, the King of Vidar-
bha. Dama, a famous King of Diṣṭa dynasty carried
away by stealth Sumanā, the daughter of Cāruvarmā,
the King of Daśārṇa, in consequence of which Vapuṣmān
and Dama became enemies.
<div n="NI"/>Vapuṣmān waited for an opportunity to take revenge
and when a convenient moment came, he killed Nari-
ṣyanta the father of Dama. Indrasenā the mother
of Dama told him of his father's murder and then
jumping into the funeral pyre of her husband, she died.
Because of grief at the loss of his parents and anger
towards the slayer, Dama started with a mighty army
and engaged Vapuṣmān in a fierce battle. He killed
Vapuṣmān in the battle and with his blood he made
offerings to the spirits of his parents. (Mārkaṇḍeya
Purāṇa, 133).
