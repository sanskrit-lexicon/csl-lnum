BHOJA III¦. A king who became renowned as a Sanskrit
scholar. It is believed that he lived from 1018 to 1054
A.D. His capital city was Dhārā. Bhoja is credited
with the authorship of two scholarly books entitled,
“Sarasvatīkaṇṭhābharaṇa” and “Sṛṅgāraprakāśa”.
Of these, the first is a compendious volume in five chap-
ters, dealing with the merits and defects of poetry,
figures of speech, etc. Bhoja observes that besides the
four styles (in poetry) laid down by Rudraka, there are
two more styles, namely, “Avanti” and “Māgadhī”.
