NAHUṢA I¦. A famous King of the Lunar dynasty.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu in the following
order:—Brahmā-Atri-Candra-Budha-Purūravas-Āyus-
Nahuṣa.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Āyus, the son of Purūravas, married the
princess named Indumatī (Svarbhānukumārī). Nahuṣa
was the son born to the couple, thanks to the blessing of
the great hermit Dattātreya. Nahuṣa married Aśoka-
sundarī, the daughter of Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>There is a story about the birth and marriage of Nahuṣa
and Aśokasundarī in Padma Purāṇa as given below:
<div n="NI"/>Once Śiva and Pārvatī were engaged in love-making in
Kailāsa. Pārvatī requested Śiva to show her the best
garden ever created by Brahmā. Śiva took her to
Nandanavana, where she saw the Kalpa tree, which
was beautiful all over, and she asked Śiva about its
special features. Śiva replied that anything asked of it
would be granted by the Kalpa tree. Pārvatī made a
request to the Kalpa tree for a girl just for a test.
Instantly a very beautiful girl was born from the tree.
Pārvatī named her Aśokasundarī and brought her up as
her daughter. Once Pārvatī gave her a boon that she
would become the wife of King Nahuṣa of the Lunar
family, who would be equal to Indra.
<div n="NI"/>One day, when the beautiful Aśokasundarī was walking
with celestial maids in the Nandanavana an asura
named Huṇḍa the son of Vipracitti, came there. The
moment his eyes fell on Aśokasundarī he fell in love
with her. The asura spoke to her of his love and re-
quested her to be his wife. Not only did she refuse his
request but also told him that according to the boon
given by Pārvatī she would become the wife of Nahuṣa,
the King of the Lunar dynasty.
<div n="NI"/>Hearing this Huṇḍa smiled and said: “That righteous
man named Nahuṣa is yet to be born in the Lunar
dynasty. You will be much older than he. He will not suit
you as he will be too young. So don't waste your blooming
youth. Come and enjoy life with me.” But Aśokasundarī
did not concede. Huṇḍa was disappointed. So he began
to think about ways to get her. He disappeared from
there and reappeared in the guise of a beautiful woman
[Page516-a+ 65]
and told Aśokasundarī thus:—“Lady, I have taken a
fast. Huṇḍa has killed my husband. I am doing penance
to curse him. You may come to my hermitage on the
banks of the Gaṅgā”.
<div n="NI"/>Aśokasundarī believed these false words. She went with
her. Both of them walked on and at last entered a
palace. Then only did she understand that it was the
palace of Huṇḍa, who assumed his original form and
tried to violate her chastity. Aśokasundarī became angry
and cursed Huṇḍa that he would die at the hands of
Nahuṣa, and ran away to Kailāsa.
<div n="NI"/>Huṇḍa was sad for two reasons. On the one hand
he did not get Aśokasundarī and on the other hand
he had incurred the curse that Nahuṣa would be his
slayer. Now what was the way to get out of the trouble?
He asked his minister Kampana to take Indumatī the
wife of Āyus by stealth and bring her to his palace. They
decided to destroy Nahuṣa in the womb of Indumatī, in
case it was not possible to carry her away. They waited
for an opportunity.
<div n="NI"/>Āyus was an emperor of righteousness. After the marri-
age, for a long time he was childless. Once he visited
the hermit Dattātreya, in his hermitage. Dattātreya
who was the son of Atri and the most famous and
the noblest of all the hermits, was quite senseless and
red-eyed because of drinking, and without even the
Brahmasūtra, was playing with a young woman,
seating her in his lap. His body was besmeared with
sandalwood and aloe and adorned with garlands and
necklaces of pearl and he was surrounded by many
women. The King seeing the divine hermit bowed
him with reverence and fear. The moment the hermit
saw the King, he sat in deep meditation. This continued
for a hundred years, at the end of which period, seeing
the devotion of the King, he said, “Oh King! why do
you take this trouble. I have left off the customs and
manners of Brahmins. I have no Brāhmaṇya (Brahmin-
ism). I am immersed in liquor, meat and women. So
you had better go and serve another Brahmin.”
<div n="NI"/>Āyus refuted all that the hermit said and requested him
to bless him that he might get a son. Finally the hermit
ordered the King to bring meat and liquor in a skull.
The King obeyed him. Dattātreya was pleased at the
devotion and willingness to serve as a disciple and told
the King that a son would be born to him; that the
son would be a worshipper of Devatīrthas (Holy baths),
that he would not be defeated by devas, asuras, Kinnaras
giants, and Kṣatriyas, that he would be the protector of
his subjects and that he would be a great scholar in
Vedas and Śāstras. Saying this he gave the King a
fruit to be given to his wife. The King returned to his
palace.
<div n="NI"/>The King gave the fruit to his wife Indumatī. She ate
it and became pregnant. One night she gave birth to a
son. When the servant-maid went out of the room of
confinement Huṇḍa entered into her body and went
in. When all were asleep he took the child and ran to
his palace at Kāñcanapura. He gave the child to his
wife Vipulā and asked her to make a sauce of the child
for him. Vipulā gave the child to the servant woman to
cook it. With the aid of the cook she hid the child and
prepared a sauce with some other flesh. The cook took
the child to the hermitage of Vasiṣṭha and placed it at
the door of the hermitage, in the night. At dawn
Vasiṣṭha came out of the hermitage and seeing the
[Page516-b+ 64]
child took it, named it Nahuṣa and brought him up.
The King and his wife Indumatī cried for a long time
over the loss of the child. At that time Nārada came
there and told them that their son would return
soon.
<div n="NI"/>Once Nahuṣa was bringing Samits (butea-fuel) when
he heard some devacāraṇas (heavenly singers) saying
among themselves the history of Nahuṣa. Nahuṣa heard
it. He told Vasiṣṭha all that he had heard. Vasiṣṭha
told him all the stories from the beginning to his being
kidnapped by Huṇḍa. Nahuṣa was amazed at what
he heard. He wanted to kill Huṇḍa instantly. So he
bowed before Vasiṣṭha and taking bow and arrow went
away to kill Huṇḍa.
<div n="NI"/>Believing that he had eaten Nahuṣa, Huṇḍa approached
Aśokasundarī again and told her that he had actually
eaten Nahuṣa. Aśokasundarī felt very sad when she
heard this. At that time a Kinnara named Vidyuddhara
and his wife came there. They consoled Aśokasundarī
and told her that Nahuṣa was alive. He continued.
<div n="NI"/>“Oh beautiful lady, that great sage will kill Huṇḍā-
sura and marry you, and live with you as an emperor
in this world, as Śakra (Indra) in heaven. From Nahuṣa
will be born to you a son named Yayāti, who will be
righteous, kind and loving towards his subjects and
equal to Indra, and a hundred daughters who would
be exceedingly beautiful and of very fine character. Then
Nahuṣa will go to heaven and become Devendra.
At that time your son Yayāti will be the emperor and
will rule his subjects with kindness. Four sons, who
would possess prowess and valour, who would be second
to none in archery will be born to him. They will be
known by the names Turvasu, Puru, Kuru and Yadu.
Powerful and mighty sons called Bhoja, Bhīma,
Andhaka, Kukkura, Vṛṣṇi, Śrutasena, Srutadhāra and
Kāladaṃṣṭra will be born to Yadu. They will become
famous by the name Yādavas. Several sons will be born
to them. Thus the family of Nahuṣa and yourself will
increase.”
<div n="NI"/>By this time Nahuṣa had arrived at the spot fully armed
and ready to fight Huṇḍa, who was killed in the terrible
battle which ensued. Nahuṣa married Aśokasundarī in
the midst of devas and after the marriage the couple
reached the palace of Nahuṣa. (Padma Purāṇa, fifteen
chapters from 102).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Nahuṣa became Indra.%}
<div n="NI"/>{%Became a python by the curse of Agastya.%} To get remission
from the sin of Brahmahatyā, incurred by killing Vṛtrā-
sura, Indra hid himself in a cluster lotuses in the Mānasa
lake. The devas who were worried due to the absence
of Indra, elected Nahuṣa as Indra temporarily. Nahuṣa
wanted to get Indrāṇī. Agastya cursed Nahuṣa and
changed him to a python. At the sight of the Pāṇḍavas
he regained his original form and went back to the
world of Indra. (For detailed story see under
Agastya).
