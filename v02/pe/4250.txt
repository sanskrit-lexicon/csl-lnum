MĀLĪ¦. A demon of great valour.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy and birth.%} There were two very brave
brothers in the demon tribe named Heti and Praheti.
They were inseparable companions of Mahābali. Pra-
heti was unmarried and spent his time in religious
pursuits. Heti married Bhayā sister of Kāla and got a
son named Vidyutkeśa. Vidyutkeśa married Sāla-
kaṭaṅkā daughter of Sandhyā and got a son named
Sukeśa Sukeśa married Devavatī, daughter of Grāmaṇī,
alias Maṇimāyā. Devavatī delivered three sons, Mālī
Sumālī and Mālyavān.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Boon to Mālī.%} The three brothers, even while young
decided to acquire great strength and started performing
penance. When their penance became very fierce
Brahmā appeared before them in person and asked them
what boon they wanted. They said, ‘We must be invin-
cible, we must be destroyers of our enemies, we must
have long life, we must become rich and powerful
ever remaining friendly with each other”. Brahmā
granted the boon asked for.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Family life.%} After obtaining the boon they went
to Viśvakarmā and asked him to construct a place of
abode for them. Viśvakarmā was frightened and he
hastened to suggest a beautiful place for them to live.
He said, “There is a mountain named Trikūṭa on the
shores of the southern sea. There is a mountain on it
called Subala. Its main top grazes the sky. Its four
sides have been beautifully chiselled. No birds fly to its
top. I have constructed there at the request of Indra
a beautiful city surrounded by walls of gold and adorned
on all sides with festoons of gold. That city is called
Laṅkā and you, demon-lords, can stay there. You will
get glory and prestige which even Indra could not
acquire in his Amarāvatī. If you live in Laṅkā with
your followers you will be unconquerable”.
<div n="NI"/>The happy demons with their people went to Laṅkā.
They married the daughters of a Gandharva woman
named Narmadā. Mālī married Vasudhā; Sumālī,
[Page472-b+ 65]

his wife Vasudhā four sons named Anila, Anala, Hara
and Sampāti. Sumālī got of his wife Ketumatī ten sons
named Prahasta, Akampana, Vikaṭa, Kālakāmukha,
Dhūmrākṣa, Daṇḍa, Supārśva, Saṃhrāda, Prakvātā and
Bhāsakarṇa and four daughters named Vekā, Puṣpot-
kaṭā, Kaikasī and Kumbhīnasī.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Death.%} The three brothers attacked Devaloka under
the leadership of Mālī and a great fight ensued and
Mālī died by the discus of Mahāviṣṇu. (Uttara Rāmā-
yaṇa).
