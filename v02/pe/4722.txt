NANDAKA II¦. A sword of Mahāviṣṇu. (M.B. Anuśā-
sana Parva, Chapter 147, Stanza 15).
<div n="NI"/>There is a story explaining how Mahāviṣṇu came by
this sword Nandaka. In days of old Brahmā performed
a sacrifice on the banks of the heavenly Gaṅgā on a
peak of mount Mahāmeru. While Brahmā was sitting
in deep meditation in the sacrifice Lohāsura was seen
coming to cause disturbance to the sacrifice. Immediate-
ly a male being came into existence from the medi-
tation of Brahmā. The male being paid homage to
Brahmā and the devas (gods) became glad and they
encouraged the male being. Because the gods greeted the
male one, he was changed to a sword called Nandaka
(that which is greeted or thanked for). That sword
was received by Mahāviṣṇu at the request of the gods.
When Mahāviṣṇu slowly took it Lohāsura came near.
He was an asura of blue complexion, with thousand
hands of adamantine fists. By wielding his club he
drove away the gods. Mahāviṣṇu cut down his limbs
one by one and those organs became metals by the
touch of the sword. Then Mahāviṣṇu killed the asura.
Then Mahāviṣṇu granted Nandaka a pure body and
various boons. Afterwards Nandaka became the deity
of weapons on the earth. Thus Brahmā, who got rid
of the disturbance by the aid of Viṣṇu, completed the
sacrifice. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 245).
