DURYODHANA I¦. Villain in the Mahābhārata story;
the eldest and greatest of the Kauravas.
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Genealogy.%} See under Kauravas.
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Birth.%} Dhṛtarāṣṭra born blind married Gāndhārī.
Hungry and thirsty, Vyāsa once came to Dhṛtarāṣṭra's
palace where Gāndhārī treated him sumptuously, and
he blessed her to have hundred sons by her husband.
Ere long Gāndhārī conceived, but even after two years
she did not deliver. Grief-stricken at this she got
herself aborted in secret as the result of which she
‘delivered’ a mass of flesh, and hearing about it Vyāsa
visited her. As instructed by him hundred pots were filled
with ghee, and the mass of flesh was sprayed with cold
water as a result of which it got divided into hundred
pieces, each the size of a thumb. Also a smaller piece of
flesh remained. Those pieces of flesh were deposited in the
pots filled with ghee and the pots kept in a secret place.
Vyāsa departed for the Himālayas for tapas.
<div n="NI"/>In course of time the pots burst open one by one and
from each pot emerged a boy. From the 101st pot a girl
was born. Eldest among the boys was named
Duryodhana, and the girl called Duśśalā. (For other
names see under Kauravas).
<div n="NI"/>Duryodhana, at the time of his birth cried in the voice
of an ass on hearing which the asses kept in their shed
also cried. Also, such evil omens as the jackal howling,
birds like crows, vultures etc. crying and storms break-
ing out were witnessed on the occasion. Alarmed by
such evil omens Dhṛtarāṣṭra sent for the brahmins and
his other friends and well-wishers like Bhīṣma and Vidura
and enquired of them whether, after the death of
Dharmaputra, Duryodhana would be able to become
King. As soon as Dhṛtarāṣṭra had asked the question, evil
omens like the world becoming dim, jackals howling etc.
were witnessed again. Scholars like Vidura did their best
to divine what the future of Duryodhana would be, and
after mature consideration Vidura and the brahmin
pandits opined that because of Duryodhana's birth the
country and people would be ruined, and they, there-
fore advised that he should be cast away and forsaken.
But, paternal affection did not permit Dhṛtarāṣṭra to
accept the advice.
<div n="NI"/>During this period Gāndhārī was laid up for a few days
with stomach trouble, and a vaiśya woman was engaged
[Page258-a+ 65]
to look after Dhṛtarāṣṭra, who begot of her a son called
Yuyutsu.
<F>1. Vyāsa blessed Gāndhārī to have 100 sons. Then how was it that she got a daughter too? On being questioned thus by King
Janamejaya Vaiśaṃpāyana replied “when Vyāsa was dividing the mass of flesh a desire to have a daughter entered the heart of Gāndhārī
and divining that desire Vyāsa cut the flesh in such a manner as to have one more piece, viz. 101</F> Thus with 100 sons and Duśśalā for daughter
Dhṛtarāṣṭra became rich in the matter of children
<F>2. Duryodhana was born as a part of Kali. (M.B. Āśrama vāsika Parva, Chapter 1).</F>
(M.B. Adi Parva, Chapter 114).
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Duryodhana harms Bhīmasena.%} Now, Pāṇḍu was
dead and Mādrī also died in the funeral pyre of her
husband. Forlorn and helpless Kuntī and her five sons
came to Hastināpura, and Dhṛtarāṣṭra welcomed them
to the palace. Thus arose the occasion for the Pāṇḍavas
and the Kauravas to live together in the Hastinā-
pura palace. And, naturally there used to be petty
differences and quarrels between the Pāṇḍava and
Kaurava princes. Bhīma being in every way a giant the
Kauravas had often to suffer at his hands. To collect all
the hundred Kaurava brothers together and throw them
away in one lump to push them to the ground, to suffo-
cate them by holding their heads under water etc—these
were some of the childish pranks played by Bhīma on
the Kauravas. The constant repetition of such pranks
and mischiefs on the part of Bhīma rendered him an
object of hatred for the Kauravas among whom the
common conviction grew that it was essential to put an
end to Bhīma's life for their safety, nay even their very
existence.
<div n="NI"/>One day, the Kauravas, with the object of doing away
with Bhīma, escorted the Pāṇḍavas to Pramāṇakoṭi on
the banks of the Gaṅgā for water sports. There all of
them ate sumptuous meals and took various drinks. But,
Duryodhana had secretly mixed Kālakūṭa poison in the
food of Bhīma. After taking meals they began playing
water-sports. After the sports were over they returned
to their tents and slept. Owing to the effects of the
poison and the overexertion during the day Bhīma
slept stone dead. While all were asleep during the night
Duryodhana bound the hands and legs of Bhīma with
cords and threw him into the depths of the Gāṅgā.
Bhīma who was still unconscious sank down to the very
bottom of the river where the denizens of nāgaloka saw
him and the nāgas bit him in anger. The poison of the
nāgas neutralised the effects of Kālakūṭa poison in
Bhīma, though their bite could not make even a scratch
on his skin. Freed thus from the effects of poison Bhīma
shook himself up from sleep and drove off the nāgas.
Alarmed at these developments the nāgas called Vāsuki
up to the scene, and he, recognising Bhīma held him in
embrace and gave him much money and costly gems
etc. Bhīma refused the gifts, but asked Vāsuki for nāga-
rasa, which would impart the strength of thousand nāgas
to those who used it. Vāsuki gave Bhīma eight potfuls
of nāgarasa, which the latter drank to the last dregs
and thus gained immeasurable strength.
<div n="NI"/>When next morning after the water-sports the Pāṇḍavas
and the Kauravas awoke from sleep Bhīma was found
missing. Duryodhana said that Bhīma had returned
earlier to Hastināpura, but this did not satisfy the
Pāṇḍavas. Kuntī lamented over the absence of Bhīma.
<div n="NI"/>Bhīma, who drank the nāga rasa lay on the veranda of
Vāsuki for eight days in the manner of one who had
lost consciousness. By the time he woke up on the eighth
day the body had almost fully assimilated the rasa.
Vāsuki told Bhīma that eight potfuls of nāgarasa
[Page258-b+ 61]
would impart the strength of 10,000 elephants. And
then at the instance of Vāsuki Bhīma took his bath in
holy waters and wore new clothes and fragrant garland.
He ate the pudding offered by Vāsuki, and taking leave
of him and followed by nāgas he came up from the
water to the bank of the Gaṅgā. Bhīma gave a detailed
description to his mother and brothers of all that had
happened to him. Dharmaputra advised him to keep
the secret. After the incident, once again was Kālakūṭa
poison mixed in the food of Bhīma. But, Yuyutsu born
of the vaiśya woman to Dhṛtarāṣṭra gave the Pāṇḍavas
confidential report about it. Because of the powerful
effect of nāga rasa, the Kālakūṭa consumed by Bhīma
did no harm to him but it only got assimilated in his
body. On another occasion Duryodhana killed the
charioteer of Bhīma. (Bhāṣā Bhārata, Chapter 127 and
129).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Karṇa crowned king of Aṅga.%} The Kauravas and the
Pāṇḍavas learnt the use of weapons of war at the feet
of Droṇācārya, and when the studies were over arrange-
ments were made for a rehearsal, and at the rehearsal
Bhīma and Duryodhana were the first to clash with
each other. When the encounter reached its climax
both of them pointed the club at each other. But, Aśvat-
thāmā intervened and pacified them. Next Karṇa enter-
ed the stage for a trial of strength with Arjuna, and
at once arose from the Pāṇḍava side questions about
Karṇa's nobility and aristocracy of birth etc. Karṇa
stood there stunned, not knowing what to say or how
to repel the attack. Then it was Duryodhana who rose
up to announce that he was, that very moment, crowning
Karṇa King of Aṅga. This ended the scene. (Bhārata
(Malayālam), Ādi Parva, Chapters 134, 135 and 136).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Pāṇḍavas trapped in palace built of lac.%} The above
incident confirmed and completed the cleavage of the
Pāṇḍavas and the Kauravas into two hostile camps.
Meantime another event happened. Droṇācārya demand-
ed of his pupils to bring before him King Drupada
by way of gurudakṣiṇā (tuition fee), for the ācārya had
to wreak vengeance upon Drupada (See under Droṇa).
Though Duryodhana tried his best he could not capture
Drupada. Not only that, Drupada defeated him also in
fight. At this juncture it was Arjuna who presented
Drupada as captive to Droṇa by way of gurudakṣiṇā.
The incident proved to be another provocation for
Duryodhana to hate the Pāṇḍavas.
<div n="NI"/>Now, Duryodhana made up his mind to destroy the
Pāṇḍavas somehow or other. With this end in view he
went to his father, posing himself to be a great well-
wisher of the Pāṇḍavas, and obtained his permission to
transfer their (Pāṇḍavas') residence to another palace.
Accordingly Duryodhana deputed his minister Purocana
to get built at Vāraṇāvata a palace of lac. Vidura came
to know of the intended mischief and gave advance
notice of it to the Pāṇḍavas through a messenger
Kanaka. The architect built the ‘lac palace’ but built a
tunnel also attached to it. A year after the Pāṇḍavas shift-
ed the residence to the new ‘palace’ Duryodhana set.
fire to it, and the Pāṇḍavas escaped unscathed through
this tunnel. (Bhārata (Malayālam) Ādi Parva, Chapters
141-151).
[Page259-a+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Duryodhana invited the Pāṇḍavas back to Hastināpura.%}
Duryodhana and his brothers were living very happily
under the impression that the Pāṇḍavas had been burnt
to ashes along with the ‘lac Palace’. Then it was that
the Pāṇḍavas, disguised as brahmins and in the presence
of all the Kings, won Pāñcālī, the daughter of King
Drupada, in svayaṃvara, for their wife. After the
marriage the Pāṇḍavas stayed in Drupada's palace and
the Kauravas returned to Hastināpura. Duryodhana
and others felt all the more jealous at the Pāṇḍavas'
becoming more powerful as a result of their marriage.
Again it was decided that the Pāṇḍavas should be des-
troyed anyhow and at any cost. But, how to effect the
destruction? Duryodhana wanted to attract the Pāṇḍa-
vas to destruction through women and to create diffe-
rences and divisions among them. But, Karṇa attacked
the plan as impracticable, and instead he wanted to
defeat Drupada and render the Pāṇḍavas impotent. At
this stage Bhīṣma and Droṇa argued that it was most
preferable to give half the Kingdom to the Pāṇḍavas
and receive them with grace. Dhṛtarāṣṭra supported
the proposal as a result of which the Kauravas went to
Pāñcāla and escorted the Pāṇḍavas back to Hasti-
nāpura. Dhṛtarāṣṭra partitioned the country between
the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas and the latter shifted
their residence to their part of the country with Khāṇ-
ḍavaprastḥa (Indraprastha) as its capital. When the
Pāṇḍavas went to Indraprastha Maya built for them
aṇ exceptionally beautiful palace where King Dharma-
putra performed {%rājasūya.%} Duryodhana and others ear-
nestly participated in it. After the rājasūya the Kaura-
vas wanted to have a look at the palace and in the
course of surveying it they placed themselves in
ridiculous situations due to visual illusions. Taking the
bright floors of glass for watery tanks they pulled up
their clothings and measured with caution every foot of
theirs. Then they mistook actual pools for floor and fell
into them and got wet. At the consequent discomfiture
of the Kauravas Bhīma clapped his hands and roared
with laughter. Draupadī hid her face with hands and
smiled. Altogether the Kauravas cut a very ridiculous
figure, and they returned to Hastināpura. (M.B. Ādi
Parva, Chapter 202, Sabhā Parva, Chapters 35, 85).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Dharmaputra's first defeat in the game of dice.%} The
sight of the great wealth including costly stones and
gems presented by various kings to Dharmaputra at the
Rājasūya and the humiliation experienced while survey-
ing the palace made Duryodhana all the more mad
with anger and hatred towards the Pāṇḍavas. He now
came to the decision either to defeat the Pāṇḍavas once
for all or to commit suicide by taking poison. He held
secret consultations on the topic with Śakuni whose
efforts at first to pacify him (Duryodhana) failed. Ulti-
mately Śakuni, an expert in the game of dice, advised
Duryodhana to invite Dharmaputra to a game, assuring
him that the rest he would take care of. Dhṛtarāṣṭra and
Vidura advised Duryodhana against the move, but he
did not yield. Finally Dhṛtarāṣṭra, saying to himself
that nobody would change fate, agreed to Duryodhana's
proposal, and deputed Vidura to Dharmaputra to invite
him for the game.
<div n="NI"/>Dharmaputra, in fact, did not like the game, but he
succumbed to the eloquence and persuasive powers of
Śakuni and at last agreed to play. Kings lined up the
[Page259-b+ 64]
royal hall to witness the game. First gems were staked.
and Duryodhana won the game. Then 1000 golden niṣkas
<F>1. 108 suvarṇa weight, an ornament worn on the chest.</F>
and treasuries were offered to the winner. Duryodhana
won that game also. Next chariot with horses and next
to that 1000 maid-servants were staked and Duryodhana
won those games too. 1000 horses, 1000 golden chariots
with their horses, the horse decorated with gold presen-
ted by Citraratha to Arjuna, 6000 soldiers with their
arms and armaments—these formed the next successive
bets, and each game Dharmaputra lost. The next bet
was 400 copper vessels each filled with pure gold, and
Duryodhana won that game also. And, now Vidura
tried to dissuade Yudhiṣṭhira from playing the game;
but neither he nor Duryodhana heeded the advice. And,
Duryodhana by foul play snatched from Dharmaputra
all his wealth, his kingdom and his brothers. Now, Pāñ-
cālī alone remained, and Dharmaputra bet her too
and played the last game and lost.
<div n="NI"/>Duryodhana deputed his Sūta, Prātikāmi, to Indra-
prastha, to fetch Draupadī but she sent him back. Next
Duśśāsana was deputed and he brought Pāñcālī to the
sabhā dragging her by the hair. She was proclaimed to
be the maid-servant of the Kauravas. At last Dhṛtarāṣṭra
intervened and sent back the Pāṇḍavas along with
Draupadī to Indraprastha.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Second game and exile in the forest.%} Duryodhana and
others did not appreciate the intervention of their father.
He again conspired with Śakuni and it was decided to
challenge Dharmaputra to one more game. The condi-
tions to be stipulated were that the vanquished in the
game should stay in exile for twelve years in the forest
and live incognito during the thirteenth year, and if
found out and recognised during this period the whole
process of exile and life incognito would have to be
repeated. Duryodhana and Śukuni approached Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra and said to him thus: “Dear father, the desire
for revenge at their defeat in the game of dice gnaws
at the Pāṇḍavas' heart like poison. Also, they will never
forget our having dragged Draupadī by her hair. When
a suitable occasion arises they will take revenge on the
whole lot of us. Therefore, we want to challenge
Dharmaputra to a final game of dice, the condition
being that he who gets defeated should go in exile into
the forest for twelve years and then to live incognito
for one year. If we get defeated we will simply carry
out the condition on our part.
<div n="NI"/>This request of Duryodhana appealed to his father, who
invited Dharmaputra once again for a game of dice.
Dharmaputra accepted the invitation, in fact, in spite
of himself. This time too Duryodhana won the stake
and the Pāṇḍavas set out to the forest. Even at the
time of parting Duśśāsana insulted Bhīma who retorted
thus: “You, mean fellows, you cheated my brother by
foul play. If I fail to tear your heart open in fight and
drink blood I do not want heaven. Moreover I will kill
Duryodhana, and Arjuna will kill Karṇa. Śakuni, the
expert in foul play in dice will be killed by Sahadeva.
We will meet in the 14th year from today at the
battlefield. Adieu.”
<div n="NI"/>Thus did the Pāṇḍavas depart for the forest. Kuntī
being too old Vidura took her to his house, and he
consoled her, lamenting over the separation from her
children. (M.B. Sabhā Parva).
[Page260-a+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Curse of Maitreya.%} The Pāṇḍavas entered the
Kāmyaka forest where they were welcomed by the
sages. Among them Maitreya whom the misfortune
of the Pāṇḍavas affected much started for Hastināpura
for peace parleys. Vidura advised Dhṛtarāṣṭra that
Maitreya's proposals should be respected lest he should
curse the King. Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Duryodhana received
the sage with respect. And, the sage asked them to
recall the Pāṇḍavas from the forest and live on friendly
terms with them. Duryodhana did not in any manner
respond to the advice of the sage, but stood there
absolutely mum tapping his thigh with his fingers and
making drawings with the fingers of his feet on the
ground. This the sage interpreted as an insult to him.
He stood up ablaze with anger and cursed Duryodhana
thus: “You will, sooner than later reap the conse-
quences of your false pride; your cruelty will invite
terrible war, and in the fight Bhīma will rend asunder
your thigh, which you struck with your fingers
just now.”
<div n="NI"/>Greatly agitated over the curse Dhṛtarāṣṭra prayed
the sage for redemption and the sage said: “if only
your son resorts to forbearance and peace the curse
will not take effect, otherwise it will come true.” And
after making this announcement the sage returned to
the forest. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 10).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%The procession.%} While the Pāṇḍavas were staying
in the Kāmyaka forest Duryodhana and others went
there on the pretext of looking after the cows. The
Gandharvas took them captive; but the Pāṇḍavas
intervened and set them free. Feeling humiliated at the
mishap Duryodhana decided to end his life after crown-
ing Duśśāsana as King. But Duśśāsana did not agree
to the proposal. (For details see Ghoṣayātrā).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Duryodhana's attempt at death and his trip to Pātāla.%}
Humiliated at the procession thus and turning down
the advice of friends to return to the palace, Duryo-
dhana spread grass on the ground and lay down there
to die. As his death would spell disaster to the Dānavas
they decided to send him back to his palace for which
purpose they performed the Vaitāna sacrifice in Pātāla.
While offering milk in the sacrificial fire a Rākṣasa
woman, Kṛtyā, arose therefrom, and at the instance
of the Dānavas she carried Duryodhana over to Pātāla.
There they told him thus: “Oh Duryodhana, a part
of your body has been earned by us from Śiva by our
penance. That part of your body above the waist is
made of diamond. Therefore, arrows will not pierce
your body. Grieve not. Bhagadatta and other heroes
have been born to help you. Your great supporter
Karṇa is possessed of the soul of Narakāsura.” These
words of the Dānavas instilled fresh hope in Duryo-
dhana, and he was taken back to his Kingdom by Kṛtyā.
This incident appeared as a dream to Duryodhana.
Bucking up confidence and courage again he returned
to Hastināpura and continued to rule (M.B. Vana
Parva, Chapter 252).
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Duryodhana's Viṣṇu yajña.%} At this juncture Duryo-
dhana thought of performing a Rājasūya for which he
invited brahmins to the palace. After bestowing much
thought on the subject the brahmins pointed out that
there was no sanction for Duryodhana to conduct a
Rājasūya as his elders, Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Dharmaputra
were still alive. At the same time they pointed out that
[Page260-b+ 64]
there was another Yajña called Viṣṇu Yajña as efficaci-
ous as Rājasūya which Duryodhana was competent to
perform. Accordingly Duryodhana performed the Viṣṇu
yajña and earned reputation among evil monarchs.
(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapters 256, 257).
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Boon from Durvāsas.%} Once Durvāsas accompanied
by his disciples, came to Duryodhana's palace, and
Duryodhana decided somehow or other to befriend and
use the maharṣi as a weapon against the Pāṇḍavas. He
housed the maharṣi and his disciples in the palace for
a few days and pleased them by careful service at which
the maharṣi asked Duryodhana to request for any boon
he desired. And, Duryodhana asked the maharṣi to
visit the Pāṇḍavas one day in the forest with his disciples
when they had finished taking their meals. The
maharṣi agreed. And, this was the period of time when
Pāñcālī had received the akṣayapātra from Sūrya.
Everyday the pātra would produce enough food for the
Pāṇḍavas and the other people with them, but it would
become empty for the day after Pāñcālī had eaten her
food. This was the nature of the akṣayapātra.
<div n="NI"/>Pāñcālī had finished her meals one day when Durvāsas
and his disciples came to the Pāṇḍavas. Not knowing
that Pāñcālī had already finished her food Dharma-
putra welcomed the maharṣi and his disciples and
requested them to take bath in the Gaṅgā and return for
their meals. Pāñcālī was in a fix. The akṣayapātra
would not produce any more food for the day, and if
not duly fed the maharṣi would get angry and curse
them. In this painful dilemma she prayed to Śrī Kṛṣṇa
for succour, and lo! he appeared and asked Pāñcālī for
some food. She replied that the akṣayapātra was quite
empty. But, Kṛṣṇa got from her the pātra and ate one
particle of Kīra (a leafy vegetable) which had stuck on
its side. That leafy substance fully satisfied his hunger
and thirst whereupon the hunger and thirst of Durvāsas
and his disciples were also quenched. Then Kṛṣṇa
asked Sahadeva to bring back the maharṣi and his
disciples from the bank of the Gaṅgā and accordingly
he went there and invited them. Only a few minutes
had passed since the maharṣi and his disciples had felt
the satisfaction of a sumptuous meal. They were also
astonished to think how in such a short time food for so
many people could be cooked by Pāñcālī. They felt
rather anxious about the reaction which Dharmaputra
would evince in case they returned to him to say that
they required no food. Durvāsas realised only too well
that to quarrel with the Pāṇḍavas, who enjoyed the
friendship and support of Kṛṣṇa was like playing with
fire. Therefore, the maharṣi with his disciples ran away
from the place secretly. Pāṇḍavas waited long for the
maharṣi and his disciples to return fearing that the object
of Durvāsas might be to return at the untimely hour
and curse them. But, Śrī Kṛṣṇa told them the details
about the maharṣi's departure and assured Dharma-
putra that he and his disciples would not return. (M.B.
Vana Parva, Chapter 263).
<div n="NI"/>13) {%War against Virāṭa.%} After twelve years' exile in the
forest the Pāṇḍavas began their life incognito at Virāṭa
nagara. Kīcaka, brother-in-law of Mātsya, the Virāṭa
King, was killed secretly by Bhīmasena, and news was
spread that Kīcaka was killed by a Gandharva.
<div n="NI"/>None of the spies deputed by Duryodhana to spot out
the Pāṇḍavas during their life incognito could gather
[Page261-a+ 65]
any information about them. One of those days
Suśarman, King of Trigarta, told Duryodhana that the
Virāṭa King had lost his power and spirits due to the
death of Kīcaka and it was, therefore, the proper time
to attack the Virāṭa country and subjugate it thor-
oughly. The idea appealed to Karṇa, who prompted
Duryodhana to war against Virāṭa. The army was
fully mobilised. As an excuse for the war, at the ins-
tance of Duryodhana, Suśarman, King of Trigarta
lifted innumerable cows of the Virāṭa King. This
happened on the day on which the life incognito of the
Pāṇḍavas was to have ended. And war started thus.
The Virāṭa prince Uttara who spent his time in the
zenana in the palace appeared in the field of war.
Arjuna, under the assumed name of Bṛhannala took up
the charioteership of Uttara. But, at the sight of the
vast Kaurava army Uttara fainted, and Arjuna hurried-
ly drove the chariot over to where his bow gāṇḍīva
was kept hidden, and with the bow in his hands Arjuna
jumped into the thick of the fight. A fierce war ensued
in which the Kaurava army was completely routed.
The life incognito of the Pāṇḍavas was also over, and
Duryodhana became naturally anxious about the future
of things. (M.B. Virāṭa Parva, Chapter 65).
<div n="NI"/>14) {%Preparation for war.%} Duryodhana refused to give
the Pāṇdavas, even after their return from twelve years'
exile in forest and one year's life incognito, even ‘as much
land as would hold a pin’, and war became inevitable.
The Pāṇḍavas and Kauravas fought the great war which
lasted for eighteen days on the field of Kurukṣetra.
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Duryodhana went to invite Śrī Kṛṣṇa.%} Preparations for
the war were gathering speed and momentum. Both
the sides were on the look out for more friends and
allies. Being told that Arjuna had gone to Dvārakā to
seek Kṛṣṇa's support Duryodhana rushed to the place.
Seeing Duryodhana from a distance Kṛṣṇa lay on his
bed in a false sleep, and Duryodhana took his seat
on a stool at the head of the bed awaiting Kṛṣṇa to
awake from sleep. Soon after, Arjuna came there and
he stood at the feet of Kṛṣṇa with head bowed down.
When Kṛṣṇa awoke from sleep it was Arjuna whom he
saw first, and while exchanging greetings with Arjuna
he was told that it was Duryodhana, who had come
first. But when Duryodhana and Arjuna explained the
object of their visit he told them thus:—
<div n="NI"/>“No doubt it was Duryodhana who came first. But, it
was Arjuna whom I met first. Since Duryodhana came
first and I saw Arjuna first I shall help both of you in
war. There is the adage that youngsters should be
given priority of consideration. So, Arjuna may indi-
cate his preference first. I shall give one of you an army
of 10 lakhs of warriors as strong in body as myself,
and I shall stand by the other without arms and with-
out fighting. Arjuna may make his choice first. And,
he chose Kṛṣṇa for his side in the war while Duryodhana
was happy to get Kṛṣṇa's mighty army. (M.B. Udyoga-
Parva, Chapter 7).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Duryodhana sought Balabhadra's help but Bala-
bhadra told him frankly that since he could not forsake
Kṛṣṇa he would remain neutral in the war. (M. B.
Udyoga Parva, Chapter 7, Verse 25).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Duryodhana got an akṣauhiṇī (a specific division of
army) from Kṛtavarman. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 7,
Verse 32).
<div n="NI"/>(4) Śalya promised to captain the Kaurava army.
[Page261-b+ 65]
(M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 8, Verse 18).
<div n="NI"/>(5) Duryodhana could collect a total of eleven akṣa-
uhiṇīs. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 19, Verse 27).
<div n="NI"/>(6) He assured Dhṛtarāṣṭra that the Kaurava army
