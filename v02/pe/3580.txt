KOLIKA¦ (KOKILA). This is the name of a rat. Kokila
is a character in the story known as Biḍālopākhyāna,
told by Nārada to Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Once a cat began to
perform penance holding up both of its hands, on the
bank of the Gaṅgā. After a long time birds and rats
began to come very close to it believing that it would
not hurt them. They made the cat their leader. The
wicked cat daily ate a rat secretly. Thus the body of
the cat grew stronger day by day and there appeared a
steady decrease in the number of the rats. Among them
there was a wise rat called Kokila. He understood the
deceit played by the cat. So proclaiming independence
he and his fellows ran away and saved themselves.
(M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 160).
