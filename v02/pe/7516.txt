TĀRĀ I¦. Wife of Bāli, best of Vānaras (monkeys).
There are two stories different from each other regard-
ing the birth of Tārā. One version is that Tārā was
born during the churning of the Milk-Ocean.
Airāvata, Uccaiśśravas, Kalpavṛkṣa, Cintāmaṇi,
Kaustubha, Candra, Apsarases, Mahālakṣmī Tārā
and Rumā rose from the sea of Milk. (Yuddha
Kāṇḍa, Kamba Rāmāyaṇa). The second version is
that Tārā was the daughter of Suṣeṇa. Bāli at the time
of his death is said to have spoken thus of his wife Tārā
“Tārā, daughter of Suṣeṇa, is well learned and is
capable of assessing a situation and suggesting the
correct thing to be done at that time. If she says a
thing is good, it is never otherwise.” (Chapter 22,
Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa). From this it
can be understood that Tārā was the daughter of
Suṣeṇa and we get an idea of the character of Tārā also
from this. (See under Bāli).
