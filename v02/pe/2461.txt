GOKARṆA¦. A sacred place of Purāṇic importance
situated on the extreme north of Kerala.
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Origin.%} There was once on the banks of the river,
Tuṅgabhadrā, a village made sacred and prosperous by
the brahmins who lived there. In that village lived a
noble brahmin named Ātmadeva. His wife was a
quarrelsome woman named Dhundhulī. Even after many
years of married life they got no children and
Ātmadeva, greatly grief-stricken, left his home and
went to the forests. He was sitting on the shore of a
lake after quenching his thirst from it when a
Sannyāsin came that way. Ātmadeva told him about his
domestic life and pleaded that he should suggest a way to
get a son for him. The sannyāsin sat in meditation for
some time and contemplated on the horoscope of
Ātmadeva and regretfully informed him that according
to his horoscope he was to have no children for seven
successive births. He, therefore, advised Ātmadeva to
[Page293-b+ 65]
abandon all his worldly pleasures and accept sannyāsa
for the rest of his life. But Ātmadeva was not to be
discouraged by this prophecy and he urged the
sannyāsin to help him somehow to get a child. The
sanyāsin then gave him a fruit and asked him to give it
to his wife and ask her to observe a life of fasting for a
period of one year.
<div n="NI"/>Greatly pleased with this boon Ātmadeva returned to
his house and told his wife all that had happened and
gave her the fruit. She liked to eat the fruit but a
year's fasting seemed troublesome to her. She was
thinking of how to get over this difficulty when her
younger sister came to her and suggested a plan. She
said “Sister, I am pregnant. I shall give you the
child I deliver. You can declare it as your child and
make your husband believe so. You can announce in
public that you have eaten the fruit and have conse-
quently become pregnant. We can, to test its merit,
give the fruit to a cow.” Dhundhulī liked the plan very
much and so did everything like that.
<div n="NI"/>The news that Dhundhulī was pregnant spread in the
city. Very soon her sister gave birth to a child and
that child was proclaimed as the child of Dhundhulī. On
the pretext that Dhundhulī was short of breast-milk her
sister started doing the breast-feeding. The child was
named Dhundhukāri.
<div n="NI"/>After three months the cow that ate the fruit delivered
a child. The ear of the child was like that of a cow
and so he was called Gokarṇa. Dhundhukāri and
Gokarṇa grew together. Dhundhukāri became a very
evil-natured boy while Gokarṇa grew into a scholarly
one. Dhundhukāri who was the very seat of everything
bad made the life of their parents wretched and the
disappointed Ātmadeva renounced all and went to the
forests and did penance and attained mokṣa. Unable
to bear the torture by her son, Dhundhulī committed
suicide by jumping into a well. Gokarṇa started on a
pilgrimage.
<div n="NI"/>Dhundhukāri lived in his own house surrounded by
prostitutes. Thieving was his only means of livelihood.
Knowing this the servants of the king started to capture
Dhundhukāri and the prostitutes who lived with him,
for their safety, bound Dhundhukāri with ropes and put
him into fire and killed him. The soul of Dhundhukāri
became a great phantom. Hearing the news of the
death of his brother, Gokarṇa returned home. He
conducted a śrāddha at Gayā to give peace to the soul
of his departed brother. But the phantom of Dhundhu-
kāri was not pacified. This phantom troubled him
always. Gokarṇa was not afraid of it and asked him
what he wanted and the phantom pleaded that in some
way Gokarṇa should get him absolved of all his sins.
Gokarṇa then consulted Pandits to know what method
should be adopted to save a soul which could not be
saved even by a Gayā-Śrāddha. The Pandits advised
him to do penance to propitiate the Sun. The Sun who
appeared before Gokarṇa as a result of his penance
declared that if he did read the entire Bhāgavata in
seven days Dhundhukāri would get mokṣa. So Gokarṇa
performed a Saptāha and among those who assembled
to hear it was the phantom of Dhundhukāri also. The
phantom finding no place to sit crept into a seven-
layered bamboo and sat there listening to Gokarṇa.
When the first day was over the first layer broke and it
went on like that every day and on the seventh day the
[Page294-a+ 63]
seventh layer broke and when Gokarṇa finished
the twelfth Skandha the phantom rose from the
bamboo to heaven. When it was going to heaven it
looked at Gokarṇa and told him that his mokṣa was due
to the result of his hearing the saptāha reading. When
Gokarṇa asked him why none of the others who heard
it got it he said that it was because none had heard it
with such rapt attention as he had done.
<div n="NI"/>Gokarṇa then conducted another reading of Saptāha
and the people present heard the same with rapt
attention. When the reading was over, a chariot of
Viṣṇu from Vaikuṇṭha descended and carried
away all those who heard the reading. The place
where Gokarṇa sat and read the Saptāha became
known later as the famous Gokarṇa. (Chapters 1 to 3,
Bhāgavata Māhātmya).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Mitrasaha and Gokarṇa.%} A King of Ayodhyā named
Mitrasaha who became famous by the name of
Kalmāṣapāda, became a demon by a curse of Vasiṣṭha.
He attained mokṣa by living and worshipping God in
the temple at Gokarṇa. (See under Śivarātri for
details).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Gokarṇa and the origin of Kerala.%} Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa
gives a story associating Gokarṇa with the origin of
Kerala.
<div n="NI"/>By the request of Bhagīratha the river Gaṅgā fell on
earth and flowing as different brooks emptied its waters
in the ocean. The level of the water in the ocean went
up and the temple of Gokarṇa and the land of Kerala
were submerged in waters. The sages who were in the
temple somehow escaped and took refuge on the
mountain Sahya. Paraśurāma was doing penance there
then and the sages went to him and told him of their
plight. Paraśurāma went and stood in Gokarṇa and
threw an axe to the south. All the land from Gokarṇa
up to the place where the axe fell rose up from the
ocean to form a piece of land which was named Kerala.
(Chapter 97 of Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa).
