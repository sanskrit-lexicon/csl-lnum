VIVĀHA¦ (MARRIAGE).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} In ancient India marriage was
considered to be a sacrifice performed in accordance with
social customs. Marriage was allowed to those who had
completed education at the age of sixteen. (Samāvar-
tana). Father or teacher teaches the pupil the Vedas
and Vedāṅgas. When the education is completed the
teacher or father makes him sit on a seat decorated
with flowers, sandalwood etc. and do Godānavrata. Then
he is offered Pañcāmṛta (milk, curd, butter, honey and
water). This is called Samāvartana. With this his
brahmacarya ends, and he is allowed to marry and
lead the life of a house-holder.
<div n="NI"/>Marriage is a ceremony with four secondary rites Viz,
Kanyādāna, Śacīyāga, Vivāha, Caturthīkarman. If the
husband is dead, or lost, or has renounced the world,
or has become a eunuch or is expelled from society, the
woman is allowed to take another husband. If the
husband dies, the wife should be given to the brother
of the husband. If there is no brother she could accept
anybody whom she likes.

should not be of the same Gotra (family). One could
