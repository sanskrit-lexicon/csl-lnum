DṚṢADVATĪ¦. A river to the south of Kurukṣetra.
During their exile in the forest the Pāṇḍavas drank
water from it. (Vana Parva, Chapter 5, Verse 2). It
was on the delta of this river that Śiva imparted advice
to Yudhiṣṭhira. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 78, Verse 15).
Living on the northern bank of this river is equal to
living in Svarga. (Vana Parva, Chapter 88). To per-
form bali and other rites for the souls of the dead after
[Page251-b+ 66]
bathing in the river is as efficacious as performing the
Agniṣṭoma Yajña. (Vana Parva, Chapter 88).
