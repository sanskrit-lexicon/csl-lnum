MATAṄGA III¦. A maharṣi born to a barber of a
brahmin woman. This clandestine birth was not known
either to the brahmin husband or Mataṅga for a long
time. Once his brahmin father sent him to the fields
for ploughing. He put a donkey to the yoke and plough-
ed. When the donkey slowed down its work Mataṅga
beat it hard. The mother of the donkey saw it and wept.
She called Mataṅga to her side and told him that he
was the son of a barber and that was why he behaved
like a caṇḍāla showing no kindness to wards the animal.
Mataṅga ran to his house and told his parents what
the mother-donkey said. After that he left his house
and did penance to become a brahmin. Indra was
pleased and he asked Mataṅga what he wanted and he
replied he wanted to become a brahmin. Indra made
him a brahmin and sent him back. (Chapter 27, Anuśā-
sana Parva).
