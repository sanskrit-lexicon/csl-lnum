ŚVETADVĪPA¦. An island. It was on this island that
Mahāviṣṇu performed his austere tapas for obtaining
“Brahma Vidyā”. It is situated on the northern side of
the ocean of milk. It is 32,000 miles above Meru
mountain. The inhabitants of Śvetadvīpa are without
the sense organs. They do not take food They are rich
in “Jñāna” (knowledge). Their bodies give out perpe-
tual fragrance. These sinless people are of white com-
plexion. Their bodies and bones are as hard as
Vajrāyudha. Their heads are as broad and flat as
umbrellas and their voice as loud as thunder. Each of
them has four arms and sixty teeth. All of them worship
Śiva. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Dākṣiṇātya Pāṭha, Chapter
335).
