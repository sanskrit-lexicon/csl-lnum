DARBHI¦. An ancient hermit. This hermit built a tīrtha
(bath) named Ardhakīla in Kurukṣetra. It is believed
that anybody who bathed in this place and fasted could
learn the mantras (spells and incantations) and become
a Brāhmaṇa. It occurs in the Purāṇas that the hermit
Darbhi has brought the four oceans to this bath. (M.B.
Vana Parva, Chapter 83, Stanza 54).
