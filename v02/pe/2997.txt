JĪRṆODDHĀRA¦. Erection and consecration of images
fixed in temples which have fallen into dilapidation, is
called Jīrṇoddhāra. Mention is made in Agni Purāṇa,
Chapter 67, about the principles of Jīrṇoddhāra, as
follows:
<div n="NI"/>The priest should adorn the image with ornaments and
perform ‘Stavana’. If the idol is very badly ruined by
age it must be abandoned. Broken image and that
with any part of the body severed or disfigured should
also be abandoned, even if it is made of stone or any
other material. When the image is renovated the
priest should make burnt offerings thousand times with
Narasiṃhamantra (spell or incantation). If the ruined
image is made of wood it should be burned. If it is
made of stone it should be placed at the bottom of
deep water, either in the sea or anywhere else. If it is
made of metals or jewels, it must be put into water.
The ruined image should be placed in a carriage and
covered with a cloth. With instrumental music and
so forth the image should be taken to water in a pro-
cession and then submerged in water. After this the
priest must be given a gift. Only after this should the
new image be erected and consecrated. On a good day
in an auspicious moment a new image of the same
material and measurement as of the old image should
be erected and consecrated by the priest.
