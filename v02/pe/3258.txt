KANYAKUBJA¦. (KĀNYAKUBJA).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} A city of Purāṇic fame on the
banks of the river Gaṅgā. This is the same place which
is now known as Kanauj. Viśvāmitra was the son of
Gādhi, King of Kanyākubja.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Origin of this city.%} Once there was a great sage
named Kuśa who was the son of Brahmā. He had of
his wife Vaidarbhī four sons named Kuśāmba, Kuśa-
nābha, Asūrtarajasa and Vasu. Kuśa asked them each
to rule a country and so each of them built a city of
his own. Kuśāmba named his city Kauśāmbī, Kuśa-
nābha gave his city the name of Mahodayapura,
Asūrtarajasa called his city Dharmāraṇya and Vasu
called his city Girivraja. Of these Mahodayapura,
city of Kuśanābha, became later famous as Kanyākubja.
(Bāla Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%How Mahodayapura became Kanyākubja.%} Kuśanābha
begot a hundred daughters of the nymph Ghṛtācī
Those beautiful girls were once playing in the forests
when the wind-god fell in love with them. The girls
rejected his love and Vāyu getting angry with them
cursed them and made them hunchbacks. Because the
hundred Kanyakās (girls) became Kubjās (hunch-
backs) at that place, the place became known as Kanyā-
kubja.
<div n="NI"/>When the daughters returned to the palace as hunch-
backs Kuśanābha was greatly distressed. Weeping, the
girls told him what had happened. At that time a sage
named Cūlī was performing penance in a forest nearby.
Somadā, daughter of Ūrmilā, a gandharva lady, married
Cūlī and they got a son named Brahmadatta. This
Brahmadatta married the hundred hunchbacks of
Kuśanābha and the very touch of Brahmadatta trans-
formed the hunchbacks into beautiful girls.
<div n="NI"/>After having given his daughters in marriage Kuśanābha
conducted a Putrakāmeṣṭi yāga to get a son. In that
Yāga Brahmā appeared in person and blessed Kuśanābha
and he got a son. The son was named Gādhi.
<F>1) Gādhi—This is found as ‘Gādhi’ in Mahābhārata and ‘Gādha’ in Rāmāyaṇa.</F> Gādhi
got a son and a daughter. The son was named Viśvā-
mitra and the daughter, Satyavatī. Ṛcīka married
Satyavatī. Gādhi and Viśvāmitra were the rulers of
Kanyākubja. See under ‘Ṛcīka, Viśvāmitra’—(Sargas
32 to 34, Bālakāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Nārada and Kanyākubja.%} There was a very big lake
in Kanyākubja. Mahāviṣṇu once showed Māyā to
Nārada at that place. (See under ‘Nārada’).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Viśvāmitra and Indra take wine together.%} Viśvāmitra
and Indra took wine together at Kanyākubja. (Śloka
17, Chapter 87, Vana Parva).
