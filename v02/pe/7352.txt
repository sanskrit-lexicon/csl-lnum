SUVARṆAṢṬHĪVĪ¦. Son of King Sṛñjaya. While sages
Nārada and Parvata were living in that King's palace
the following incident took place.
<div n="NI"/>Sṛñjaya expressed his sorrow over having no issues to
Nārada who then blessed him to have a son called
Suvarṇaṣṭhīvī. The King began performing Yajñas
from that day onwards and his queen conceived and in
due time delivered a child who was named Suvarṇa-
ṣṭhīvī and he became an ascetic even as a boy. Indra
got alarmed by the penance of Suvarṇaṣṭhīvī and tried
to frighten him by assuming the forms of various cruel
beasts. He also sent his Vajrāyudha against the ascetic,
but all to no purpose.
<div n="NI"/>The boy became four or five years old when one day
while strolling in the company of his mother on the
banks of the Gaṅgā, a tiger jumped upon him. This
tiger of illusion had been sent by Indra and the tiger
killed the boy. His mother wept aloud and people in
the palace gathered around her. Sṛñjaya wept bitterly.
Ultimately Nārada appeared, consoled the King and
with the permission of Indra brought the boy back to
life. (Śānti Parva, Chapter 31; also see under Sṛñjaya)
