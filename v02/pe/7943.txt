VAJRĀYUDHA¦ (Thunderbolt). The famous weapon
of Indra.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%The making of this weapon.%} In olden days a fierce
asura named Vṛtra was born. The Kālakeyas and
many other asuras became his followers. They began to
create havoc in the world, and cause harm to the
Devas. At last under the leadership of Indra, the Devas
went to Brahmā and informed him of their grievances
and requested for advice as to the way of killing Vṛtra.
Brahmā told them that only with a weapon made of the
bone of the hermit Dadhīca, could Vṛtrāsura be killed.
The Devas went to the bank of the river Śoṇa and saw
the hermit Dadhīca, who was the foremost of munificent
men, doing penance there. Indra told him the purpose
of their visit. He told the Devas to take his bone, if it
was useful to them. Saying this he forsook his body. The
Devas took the bones of the hermit and gave them to
Viśvakarmā who made a powerful weapon with them
and gave that to Indra. They named the weapon the
‘thunderbolt.’ (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 100).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The face of Subrahmaṇya was cut.%} Once Indra was
defeated by Narakāsura. He went to the Himālayas and
hid himself there. Unable to see their King Indra, the
devas went to Subrahmaṇya. When Indra knew this, he
thought that Subrahmaṇya had taken possession of the
world of the gods. So he came and fought with Su-
brahmaṇya. The thunderbolt of Indra touched the face
of Subrahmaṇya and wounded him. From the blood
which flowed from the face of Subrahmaṇya two noble
men appeared who eventually became warriors of
Subrahmaṇya. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Lāvāṇakalambaka,
Taraṅga 6).

<div n="NI"/>3) {%Daily thunderbolt.%} In Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chap-
ter 5 and Aṃśa 2, Chapter 8, a process by which
thunderbolt is made daily in the evening from the water
particles thrown by Brahmins when they recite the spell
Gāyatrī, is described.
<div n="NI"/>In the evening, the fierce giants called the Mandehas
wish to eat the Sun. Prajāpati had given them a curse
that though their bodies would not perish they would
daily meet with death. So there is a fight between these
giants and the sun daily in the evening. At that time
the Brahmins recite the spell Gāyatrī with the Brahma-
pervading syllable ‘OM,’ and throw up water. This
water becomes the Vajra weapon, and burns the giant.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The thunderbolt became a tiger.%} The hermits Nārada
and Parvata once went to the palace of the King
Sṛñjaya. The King worshipped them and served
them for a long time, as a result of which a son was
born to him. Indra decided to lessen the superior
power of these hermits. Once the son of the King, who
was a mere boy, was playing in the forest. At the in-
struction of Indra, the thunderbolt took the form of a
tiger and went to the forest and killed the boy. Sṛñjaya
became very sad. Nārada and Parvata brought the boy
to lite again and gave him to the King. (M.B. Śānti
Parva, Chapter 30).
