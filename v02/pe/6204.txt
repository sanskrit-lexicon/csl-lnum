ŚAṄKUKARṆA I¦. A muni, who lived at the sacred
Kapardīśvara tīrtha in Vārāṇasī. There lived a brahmin
in the temple there performing tapas. One day a lean
and bony ghost, hungry and panting came to the
brahmin. To the brahmin's question the ghost replied
thus; “In my previous life I was a rich brahmin. I
looked after my family well, but did not worship
Devas, guests or cows. Nor did I do any pious deed.
But, one day I happened to worship Lord Viśvanātha
and touch his idol. Within a short period after that I
died. You will please tell me the means, if any, for me
to attain heaven.”
<div n="NI"/>Śaṅkukarṇa answered the ghost as follows:—“There
lives no man on earth, who is more fortunate than your
good self, who could touch and prostrate before Lord
Viśvanātha. That good fortune has led you to me. You
bathe in this holy tīrtha and you will lose your ghost-
hood. The ghost, accordingly dived in the water and
immediately rose up to heaven. (Padma Purāṇa, Ādi
Khaṇḍa, Chapter 34).
