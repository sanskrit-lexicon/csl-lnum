KABANDHA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} The demon who attacked Rāma
and Lakṣmaṇa while they were wandering in Daṇḍa-
kāraṇya after the abduction of Sītā by Rāvaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Previous history of Kabandha.%} There was a King of Gan-
dharvas called Śrī. He had a son named Danu. Danu
was known as Viśvāvasu also. Viśvāvasu once per-
formed a penance to propitiate Brahmā for long life
and Brahmā appeared before him and blessed him with
immortality. Arrogant of this acquisition he roamed
about as he pleased.
<div n="NI"/>One day he attacked Indra and the latter furious at his
impudence used the Vajrāyudha on him and the head
and thighs of Viśvāvasu were squeezed into his body.
Viśvāvasu pleaded that he should be given some way
to take his food. Indra then granted him two very long
hands and a mouth on his belly. Then Viśvāvasu spent
his days in a forest near the Mataṅgāśrama in Krauñ-
cāraṇya bearing the name Kabandha (Headless trunk).
Indra added that he would attain his real form when
Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa cut his hands.
<F>1) “I am the son of Śrī named Danu” says Kabandha to Lakṣmaṇa in Śloka 8, Chapter 71, of the Araṇya Kāṇḍa of Vālmīki
Rāmāyaṇa. In Śloka 42, Chapter 279 of Araṇya Kāṇda, Kabandha says, “I am a gandharva, Viśvāvasu and came to be born in a demonaic
womb by the curse of a brahmin.”</F>
<div n="NI"/>A favourite pastime of Kabandha was to frighten the
sages. One day he attacked a sage called Sthūlaśiras
and that sage cursed him saying that he would retain
his ugly figure for ever. The demon pleaded for relief
and the sage said that he would regain his original
figure when Rāma cut his hands and left him in the
desolate forest. From that day onwards Kabandha
lived there waiting for Śrī Rāma. (Sarga 70, Araṇya
Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3). {%Kabandha meets Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa.%} Jaṭāyu was
lying half dead by a blow from the sword of Rāvaṇa
and Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa went to him and talked to
him. He gave them some information regarding Sītā
before he died. After burning the body of Jaṭāyu in a
funeral pyre Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa went westwards.
They entered the Krauñcāraṇya and reached Mataṅga-
vana. There they saw a great cave. A huge demoness
attacked them near that cave and seeing the beautiful
form of Lakṣmaṇa she invited him for amorous plays.
Lakṣmaṇa cut off her ear, nose and breasts. Then they
entered deep into the forests. Bad omens greeted them.
[Page362-a+ 65]
Before long they saw Kabandha rushing towards them.
He is described thus in the Mahābhārata:
<div n="NI"/>“He was as big as a mountain, dark as a black cloud,
with pointed hairs all over his body and looked fierce
with a voice as loud as thunder. He had an eye on his
stomach, round and yellow, emitting a glare like a
fire-flame. Looking wicked he thrust his big tongue out
of his huge mouth licking the sides.”
<div n="NI"/>The demon stretched out his big hands and caught
hold of Śrī Rāma in his right hand and Lakṣmaṇa in
his left hand. Finding themselves helpless in his hands
Lakṣmaṇa implored Rāma to flee away from the
demon leaving him alone. Śrī Rāma cut off Kabandha's
right hand and Lakṣmaṇa cut off the left hand.
Kabandha then asked them who they were. Kabandha
told Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa his previous story and then
fell dead. Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa burnt the dead body in
a funeral pyre. He rose up in the air as the Gandharva
King of old and advised Śrī Rāma to go to Sugrīva for
knowing more about Sītā. (Sargas 70 to 72, Araṇya
Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
