BHĀṆḌĪRA¦(M). An ancient forest. It was in this
forest situated in Aṃbāḍi that Śri Kṛṣṇa with his cow-
herd chums conducted his childhood exploits. There
was a very huge tree of name Bhāṇḍīra in this forest
and it was under this great tree that Kṛṣṇa and his
friends met daily for their play. This forest is on the
northern bank of Gaṅgā in front of Keśighaṭṭa in
Vṛndāvana. The Purāṇas proclaim that it was here that
Brahmā conducted the marriage of Kṛṣṇa with Rādhā.
(Chapter 38, Sabhā Parva, Dākṣiṇātya Pāṭha, M.B.).
