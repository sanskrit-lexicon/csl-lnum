ṚKṢARAJAS¦. A monkey who was the foster-father of
Bāli and Sugrīva. He was the king of Kiṣkindhā. He
had no issue for a long time. Bāli and Sugrīva were
brought up by Ahalyā at Gautama's āśrama. Ṛksarajas,
with the permission of Indra, went to the āśrama and
took Bāli and Sugrīva with him to Kiṣkindhā. From
that time, Bāli and Sugrīva remained with him as his
foster-sons. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>There is a story in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Prakṣipta Sarga,
about the origin of this monkey.
<div n="NI"/>Once when Brahmā was in a state of meditation on the
Meru mountain, tears rolled down from his eyes and
he gathered the tears in his own hands. From those
tears, a monkey came into being. Ṛkṣarajas was that
monkey.
<div n="NI"/>One day, Ṛkṣarajas went to a lake to quench his thirst.
Seeing his own image reflected in the water, he thought
it was some enemy and jumped into the lake, to
attack him. But he soon realized his mistake and
returned to the shore. As soon as he came out of the
water, he felt that he had become a woman. Seeing her
fascinating beauty, Indra and Sūrya were filled with
lustful passion. Both of them had involuntary emission
of semen. Bāli was born from Indra's semen which
fell on the head and Sugrīva was born from Sūrya's
semen which fell on the neck of Ṛkṣarajas. Towards the
end of the night, Ṛkṣarajas lost his female form and re-
gained his former shape as a male. At once he took the
two children with him to Brahmā and told him the
whole story. Brahmā sent a messenger with Ṛkṣarajas
and had him anointed king of Kiṣkindhā. After the
time of Ṛkṣarajas, Bāli became king of Kiṣkindhā.
