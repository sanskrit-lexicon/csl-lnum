DEVADATTA I¦. A famous brahmin boy whose story is
described in the Kathāsaritsāgara.
<div n="NI"/>Devadatta was the son of the Brahmin, Haridatta of
Kambukapura. Though as a boy Devadatta learnt all
the arts and sciences when he grew up to be a youth he
became a very wayward fellow. Dice-play became his
main job. One day in a game of dice he lost even his
clothes, and being afraid of his father, he left the place
without returning home.
<div n="NI"/>Devadatta roamed about, and during one such trip
he saw a deserted temple, and a muni called Jālapāda
engaged in reciting mantras. Devadatta prostrated be-
fore the muni and told him all the details about himself.
The muni accepted Devadatta as his śiṣya and promised
to secure vidyādharahood for him.
<div n="NI"/>Next night Jālapāda led Devadatta to a burning ghat,
[Page208-b+ 64]
nearby the temple. After conducting Pūjā in the shade
of a fig tree with offerings of Pāyasa and Vaiśva-
devabali the muni told Devadatta thus: “You should
come here daily and perform pūjā like this, and pray
at the close of it, ‘Oh! Vidyutprabhā! please accept my
pūjā.’
<div n="NI"/>Devadatta acted according to the above advice of the
muni, and one day, at the close of his pūjā the tree broke
open into two and a beautiful female who appeared from
it took him with her saying that her mistress wanted him.
He was thus taken to a house studded with gems wherein
he saw a noble lady seated on a cot. She caught Deva-
datta by his hands and after seating him alongside said
to him: “I am Vidyutprabhā, daughter of the Yakṣa
king Ratnavarṣa. I am a virgin girl. Muni Jālapāda
has worshipped me so much that I have decided to
fulfil his desire. I am in love with you and you will
please wed me.”
<div n="NI"/>Accordingly Devadatta married Vidyutprabhā and lived
there with her. In due course she conceived, and Deva-
datta met Jālapāda and told him about the whole
affair, and the muni, to achieve his personal object
asked Devadatta to cut open the abdomen of Vidyut-
prabhā and take to him the child found therein. Deva-
datta did not at all relish the idea. Yet reluctant to
disobey his preceptor he returned to his wife. She permit-
ted him to carry out the directions of the muni, yet his
mind did not approve of the action. Then Vidyutprabhā
herself cut open her abdomen, took the child out of it
and placing it before her husband told him thus:—
“He who eats the child will become a Vidyādhara.
Take it. I was a Vidyādharī turned into a Yakṣī by a
curse, and to cut open my abdomen and take out the
child like this was the redemption promised me from the
curse, and now I go to the Vidyādhara world; we shall
meet there.” And she disappeared.
<div n="NI"/>In great sorrow Devadatta brought the child to Jāla-
pāda who, after sending him out on the pretext of his
(Jālapāda's) performing Bhairavapūja, ate up the child.
Devadatta returned and when he knew of the action of
his preceptor he was overcome with rage. But the latter
rose up to the skies assuming the form of a Vidyādhara.
Devadatta made up his mind to anyhow take revenge
upon Jālapāda, and he also went to Vidyādharaloka with
the help of a Vetāla whom he befriended by offering
human flesh. And, there he saw Jālapāda drunk with
pride at his Vidyādharahood sitting on a throne of
gems in a mansion. Meanwhile Vidyutprabhā who was
now once more a Vidyādharī had turned down the
advances made by the erstwhile Jālapāda for her love.
But, at the sight of Devadatta her face flushed with love
for him while, in fear, the sword fell down from the
hands of Jālapāda who now fainted. Devadatta pre-
vented the Vetāla from killing Jālapāda and he (Vetāla)
at the instance of Devadatta took Jālapāda to the burn-
ing ghat and cremated him there.
<div n="NI"/>Kātyāyanīdevī at this time appeared before Devadatta
and pleased with his courage appointed him as chief of
the Vidyādharas. He wedded Vidyutprabhā and lived
happily. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Caturdārikālaṃbakaṃ,
Taraṅga 3).
