MĀLYAVĀN II¦. Son of the demon Sukeśa. He was the
brother of Mālī and Sumālī.
<div n="NI"/>This Mālyavān was the father of Rāvaṇa's mother.
They were all living in Pātāla but when Rāvaṇa
obtained his boon he sent away Kubera from Laṅkā
and became the ruler of Laṅkā. Mālyavān and other
demons followed Rāvaṇa to Laṅkā and stayed with him
confirming his sovereignty over the place.
<div n="NI"/>In the Rāma-Rāvaṇa battle Sugrīva stole the crown of
Rāvaṇa and kicked him on his face. Ashamed of the
insult Rāvaṇa went back to his palace and the first per-
son he saw was Mālyavān. The old man had come to
advise Rāvaṇa to give back Sītā to Śrī Rāma. But
Rāvaṇa did not like the advice and tore to pieces the
letter of advice. (For more details see under Mālī).
