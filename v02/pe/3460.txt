KĀYAVYA¦. A Caṇḍāla. He was born to a Caṇḍāla
woman as the son of a Kṣatriya. But the Caṇḍālas
who were impressed by Kāyavya's moral conduct,
made him the headman of the village. He taught
others that all people should honour Brāhmaṇas and
love their country. His political creed was that those
who prospered by the ruin of a country were just like
the worms living on a dead body. (M.B. Śānti Parva,
Chapter 135).
