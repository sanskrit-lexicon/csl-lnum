ANASŪYĀ¦. Wife of Sage Atri, son of Brahmā. (Viṣṇu
Purāṇa, Part 1, Chapter 10).

Brahmā, Svāyambhuva Manu, Devahūti, Anasūyā. To
Svāyambhuva, son of Brahmā, was born by his wife
Śatarūpā five children: Uttānapāda, Priyavrata, Āhuti.
Devahūti and Prasūti and Devahūti was married to

<div n="NI"/>2) {%The Tapaśśakti of Anasūyā.%} Once upon a time, rains
having failed for ten years the whole world sweated in
agony and river Gaṅgā got dried up. Famine stalked the
world. In this dire contingency it was the tapaśśakti of
Anasūyā that made trees bear fruits and Gaṅgā to flow
again. Also, she converted ten days into nights on the
request of the Devas.
<div n="NI"/>During their forest life Rāma and Sītā reached the her-
mitage of sage Atri, and the sage and Anasūyā treated
the guests sumptuously. The above story about the
tapaśśakti of Anasūyā was told then by Atri. The story
helped to increase Rāma's respect for Anasūyā. Anasūyā
gave Sītā all proper advice. She taught Sītā that abso-
lute service to husband is the greatest tapas ordained
to women. Anasūyā gave to Sītā a very sacred garland
and a sublime gem. And, after that Rāma and Sītā left
the hermitage. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Ayodhyākāṇḍa,
Cantos 117 and 118.).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Sons of Anasūyā.%} She had three sons: Dattātreya,
Durvāsas and Candra. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part 1, Chapter
10). (The reason for Mahāviṣṇu being born as Dattāt-
reya, Śiva as Durvāsas and Brahmā as Candra to
Anasūyā is given under Atri).
