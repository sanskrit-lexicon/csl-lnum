<div n="NI"/>2) {%Previous birth.%} Arjuna and Śrī Kṛṣṇa are often re-
ferred to as Naranārāyaṇas (Nara and Nārāyaṇa). In
their previous life they were two Ṛṣis called Nara and
Nārāyaṇa, and from that time onwards they lived as
inseparable companions and sons of the same parents.
They entered Mahāsamādhi at Badaryāśrama in the
Himālayas. Of the two Nārāyaṇarṣi was a partial in-
carnation of Viṣṇu. About the Nararṣi the Devī Bhāga-
vata has the following to say: “Dharma had his
origin in the heart of Brahmā, and he earned great
reputation for truthfulness and adherence to Vedic
dharma. He married the daughters of Dakṣa. Dharma
had four sons, Hari, Kṛṣṇa, Nara and Nārāyaṇa. Of
the four sons Hari and Kṛṣṇa became great yogīs, and
Nara and Nārāyaṇa, great tapasvins. Nara and Nārā-
yaṇa did tapas, worshipping Brahmā for 1000 years at
the holy Badaryāśrama in the plains of the Himālayas.
Nara was born in the next birth as Arjuna. (Devī
Bhāgavata, 4th Skandha). See Nara.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Birth.%} To Vicitravīrya son of Śantanu was born
Dhṛtarāṣṭra by Ambikā, and Pāṇḍu by Ambālikā.
Pāṇḍu had two wives, Kuntī and Mādrī. The curse of a
Muni made physical contacts with his wives impossible for
Pāṇḍu. (See Pāṇḍu). Kuntī, before her marriage had
attended on Maharṣi Durvāsas who pleased with her
service made a gift of five mantras to her. The effect
of the mantras was that Kuntī would become mother of
a son from him about whom she was thinking while she
repeated the mantra. As soon as she got the mantras
she retired to a solitary place and thinking of the Sun-
God repeated the first mantra. At once Sūryadeva appear-
ed and Karṇa was born to her by him. After assuring
her that the incident would not affect her chastity Sūrya
disappeared. Kuntī abandoned the child to float in the
river Gaṅgā, and stayed with Pāṇḍu keeping the other
four mantras to herself. Since Pāṇḍu could not contact
the body of his wives, with his permission Kuntī began
practising the other four mantras one by one. By three
mantras she got three sons, Dharmaputra from Kāla,
Arjuna from Indra and Bhīmasena from the wind God
(Vāyu). The remaining one mantra Kuntī gave to
Mādrī. She repeated it thinking of the Aśvinī Devas,
and two sons, Nakula and Sahadeva were born to her.
(M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 63 onwards).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Festival of birth.%} At the birth of Arjuna Kuntī heard
a heavenly voice declare as follows: “Oh! Kuntī!
your son will be equal to Śiva in prowess and uncon-
querable just as Indra is. After defeating all the Kings
he will perform the Aśvamedha thrice. He will please
[Page049-a+ 65]
Śiva and get the great weapon called Pāśupata from
him. On the orders of Indra he will kill Nivātakavacas.
Hearing the above prophecy the Devas played ecstatic
music and flowers were showered from the sky. The
Saptarṣis, Prajāpatis and other sages arrayed themselves
in the sky. Thus, all animate and inanimate objects
celebrated the birth of Arjuna.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Naming.%} Sages from the top of the Śataśṛṅga
mountain came together to perform the christening
ceremony of Arjuna. While enumerating the various
names of Arjuna, it is said in the Virāṭa Parva that
Kṛṣṇa was the name Pāṇḍu gave to his son. (M.B., Ādi
Parva, Chapter 123, Verse 20).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Childhood.%} The Pāṇḍavas spent their childhood at
Hastināpura with the Kauravas. Then Arjuna studied
the art and science of using weapons, dance, music etc.
along with the other boys. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter
129, Verse 1). Kaśyapa, the high priest of Vasudeva
did for Arjuna the usual Saṃskāras like Upanayana
(wearing of the holy thread) etc. Arjuna was taught
the first lessons in Dhanurveda (Science of archery)
by Rājarṣi Śuka. Afterwards, Kṛpācārya became the
preceptor of the Pāṇḍavas in Dhanurveda, and it was
then that Droṇācārya came. There is a particular story
about Droṇācārya becoming the guru. (See Droṇa).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Special favour of Droṇa.%} Arjuna showed very great
interest in the science of the use of weapons. Droṇa, the
master, wanted to teach Aśvatthāmā, his son, certain
special things, and he began sending all his disciples to
fetch water. Aśvatthāmā used to be the first to return
with the water, and before the others returned Droṇa
began teaching Aśvatthāmā the special lessons. Arjuna
came to understand this programme and he began
returning with water along with Aśvatthāmā. Then
the guru began teaching the special things to both
Aśvatthāmā and Arjuna. Droṇa instructed the cook
not to serve Arjuna food in the darkness. While
Arjuna was once taking his food, wind blew out the
burning lamp, and Arjuna alone continued eating.
Because of constant practice Arjuna was quite sure
about the position of the hand and the mouth in
the process of eating, and Arjuna surmised from this
that archery also could be practised in darkness. He
began practising them. The guru came to know of it,
and witnessing Arjuna's performance praised Arjuna as
a unique archer. (Bhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 132).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Ekalavya's finger was cut.%} Ekalavya, son of Hiraṇya-
dhanus, King of the Niṣādas (a tribe of hunters, forest-
men) approached Droṇa to learn the science of the
use of weapons. Droṇa, the Brahmin, refused the prayer
of this prince of the forest tribe. Ekalavya, after pros-
trating at the feet of Droṇa returned to the woods,
made an image of Droṇa with earth and meditating
upon it as guru began practising the use of weapons.
<div n="NI"/>The Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas went hunting in the
forest. Seeing there Ekalavya with his matted hair and
clad in deer skin the hunting dogs began barking at
him. Ekalavya shot into the mouth of the dog seven
arrows at one and the same moment. With the arrows
thrust in the mouth the dogs ran back to the Pāṇḍavas,
and they found out the culprit, Ekalavya, who claimed
himself to be a disciple of Droṇa. Grief-stricken at this
claim Arjuna hurried up to Droṇa and said: “You had
pronounced me to be your foremost disciple without an
equal. But, today Ekalavya, another disciple of yours
[Page049-b+ 64]
has relegated me to the second place”. Thereupon
Droṇa went and saw Ekalavya in the forest. Ekalavya,
in all devotion stood up and saluted the guru. And
the guru said as follows: “Oh! Ekalavya if thou
art my disciple give me the dakṣiṇā (fee) due to the
guru, and I desire to get the thumb of your right hand as
my fee”. At once Ekalavya cut his thumb and gave it to
Droṇa. Henceforth Arjuna became Droṇa's unequalled
disciple. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 132).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Arjuna got Brahmaśirāstra.%} When once Droṇa and
his disciples were bathing in the river Gaṅgā, a whale
caught hold of the leg of the guru. The combined
efforts of the disciples failed to extricate the leg from
the grip of the whale. Ultimately Arjuna shot an arrow
and released the guru's leg. Greatly pleased at this
Droṇa imparted to Arjuna knowledge about Brahma-
śirāstra, and Arjuna was enjoined not to use the astra
against men, but to use it only when confronting
higher beings than men. [Bhārata (Malayalam), Ādi
Parva, Chapter 133].
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Competition in arms.%} When the training of the princes
was almost over Dhṛtarāṣṭra decided to have a rehear-
sal of their attainments, and the scene for it also was
set. The princes with bows and arrows appeared on
the scene. Yudhiṣṭhira and others first exhibited their
skill in shooting arrows in the order of their seniority.
Every scene was explained to Dhṛtarāṣṭra by Vidura
and to Gāndhārī by Sañjaya. Duryodhana and
Bhīma clashed with each other. Aśvatthāmā pacified
them and kept them apart. And, then Arjuna and
Karṇa appeared on the scene, and the onlookers dec-
lared them to be equal in skill in archery. When
their shooting exhibition was over, Karṇa who got
angry again rushed to the stage. Arjuna also got
ready. Arjuna challenged Karṇa's eligibility on the
ground that he was low-born and not a Kṣatriya. At
once Duryodhana proclaimed him as the King of Aṅga.
Though this pacified the scene, this competition in
archery served much to make the Kauravas and the
Pāṇḍavas the bitterest of enemies. (M.B., Ādi Parva,
Chapters, 136, 137).
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Arjuna's gurudakṣiṇā (Offering of fee to the preceptor).%}
At the starting of training the princes Droṇa told them:
“I have one thing in mind, and you must do it for
me when you have completed the course of training.
All the disciples except Arjuna kept silent at this, but
Arjuna promised to fulfil the guru's wish at the
proper time
<div n="NI"/>The training was over, and it was time for gurudakṣiṇā.
Droṇa asked to be brought bound before him Drupada,
King of Pāñcāla. (For Droṇa's enmity towards Dru-
pada see Drupada). Thereupon the Pāṇḍavas marched
to Pāñcāla, and in a fierce battle Arjuna defeated
Drupada. Though Bhīma tried to kill Drupada Arjuna
did not permit it, but took him bound to Droṇa.
This ended Droṇa's hatred towards Drupada, who
now gifted half his kingdom to Droṇa. Droṇa was
very much pleased with Arjuna for the above act,
and advised him to fight even him (Droṇa) if the
latter opposed him (Arjuna). To this Arjuna replied
‘Yes’. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 139, Verse 14). With
this promise to fight even the guru in case the guru
attacked him Arjuna became the most reputed archer
in Bhārata.
[Page050-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Jealousy of Dhṛtarāṣṭra.%} After the gurudakṣiṇā Arjuna
marched against the neighbouring kingdom. He de-
feated very easily in war the King of Yavana and the
Kings Sauvīra, Vipula and Sumitra. These victories of
Arjuna made the Kauravas very anxious; Dhṛtarāṣṭra
brooded over it. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 138, Verses
20-23).
<div n="NI"/>13) {%Escape from the waxen palace.%} Duryodhana made
up his mind to destroy the Pāṇḍavas somehow or
other. He got the Pāṇḍavas to shift their residence to
a palace made of wax at Vāraṇāvata, and one year after
this the palace was set fire to. The Pāṇḍavas escaped
death by fire through a tunnel and entered the forest,
the next day. (See Arakkillam).
<div n="NI"/>14) {%Arjuna on the banks of river Ga gā.%} The Pāṇḍavas walk-
ed much through the terrible forest, and after midnight
reached the banks of the Gaṅgā. At that time Aṃgāra-
parṇa (Citraratha), the Gandharva was enjoying
his time in the river with some Apsarā women. The
presence of men at the scene, the Gandharva did not
relish. Arjuna and the Gandharva crossed in words,
which led to a duel. In the duel the Gandharva was
defeated. As the wife of the Gandharva prayed with
tears in her eyes Arjuna spared him his life. The
grateful Gandharva told the Pāṇḍavas many interesting
stories. He also made a present of divine horses and
imparted to them the esoteric knowledge called Cākṣuṣī-
vidyā. The Gandharva finally told the Pāṇḍavas that
they were attacked because they came without Agni and
Āhuti in their front. He also explained this fact that
Arjuna could subjugate him on account of his (Arjuna's)
genuine celibacy. (See Citraratha).
<div n="NI"/>15) {%Pāñcālisvayaṃvara.%} Citraratha, during his talks
with the āṇḍavas had pointed out to them the need to
have a priest to lead and guide them in all matters,
and accordingly they visited Dhaumyāśrama and ins-
talled the Maharṣi (Dhaumya) as their priest.
<div n="NI"/>And, meantime seeing thousands of people on their way
to attend the Svayaṃvara (marriage by open choice
of husband by the girl) of Kṛṣṇā (Pāñcālī) daughter
of the King of āñcāla, the Pāṇḍavas also followed the
crowd. Veda Vyāsa, whom the Pāṇḍavas met on their
way blessed them. King Drupada wished to give his
daughter Kṛṣṇā in marriage to Arjuna. The news that
the ṇḍa as were burned to death in the palace of
wax grieved Drupada. Yet he had made arrangements for
a trial of strength by Heroes at the Svayaṃvara. A
tremendous bow was got ready and installed on the
ground, and a machine constructed which was kept
suspended in the air. The target was placed inside
the machine. And then Drupada spoke thus: “My
daughter shall be married to him who will bend the
bow and with the first arrow hit the target placed
inside the machine”. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 155,
Verse 11). Great warriors like Duryodhana, Karṇa,
Śiśupāla, Śiṃśumāra took their seats in the marriage
hall. All the kings failed even to lift the bow up. Ulti-
mately Arjuna lifted the bow and hit the target very
easily. Pāñcālī put the wedding garland on Arjuna's
neck. When the Pāṇḍavas returned to their mother
with Pāñcālī in the evening the mother from inside her
room said: “What you have got today, my sons, you
enjoy among yourselves.” Kuntī said this under the
impression that what her sons had got was some
Bhikṣā. At any rate, in obedience to the above injunc-
[Page050-b+ 65]
tion of the mother Pāñcālī became wife to the five
Pāṇḍavas. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapters 190, 191).
<div n="NI"/>16) {%Arjuna at Indraprastha.%} The svayaṃvara of Pāñcālī
broadcast news about the whereabouts of the Pāṇḍavas.
Dhṛtarāṣṭra brought them back to Indraprastha, and
installed them in a new palace built at the place called
Khāṇḍavaprastha. (Indraprastha). Dharmaputra ruled
a part of the country with Indraprastha as capital.
Nārada went there once and advised the Pāṇḍavas to
guard themselves against mutual quarrels as the five of
them claimed one and the same woman as wife. Thence-
forth it was set forth that Pāñcālī would live with each
husband in turn for one year. It was also settled that
during a particular year if any other husband than the
one whose turn it was to live with Pāñcālī saw her the
intruder was to go on a pilgrimage for one year.
<div n="NI"/>Once a brahmin came to the palace complaining that
his cows were stolen by thieves, and Arjuna promised to
help him. Arjuna did so without remembering that all
his weapons were stored in Dharmaputra's palace. That
year Pāñcālī was living with Dharmaputra. Forgetting
the fact Arjuna went to Dharmaputra's palace, got his
weapons and helped the brahmin. For thus breaking
the rule Arjuna left his palace on a pilgrimage for one
year.
<div n="NI"/>17A) {%Arjuna married Ulūpikā and Citrāṅgadā.%} Arjuna
with his bow and arrows went into the forest. Many
brahmins followed him. Arjuna reached the banks of
Gaṅgā and entered the waters for a bath. Here Arjuna
was attracted by Ulūpikā, daughter of the Nāga King
and he married her. A son was born to them called Irā-
vān. After visiting places like Agastyavaṭam, Vasiṣṭhagiri
Arjuna reached Manalur. He married Citrāṅgadā,
daughter of Citrāṅgada, King of Manalur. After a stay
of three months there he went southwards. Citrāṅgadā
gave birth to a son named Babhruvāhana.
<div n="NI"/>17B) {%The mark on Arjuna's flag is Hanūmān, and the%}
{%following story is attached to it.%} Arjuna, once during a
tour of the country was much surprised to see the Dam
constructed by Śrī Rāma from Rāmeśvara to Laṅkā.
He also felt that it was not at all proper on the part
of Śrī Rāma to have sought the help of monkeys to
construct the dam. Śrī Rāma could have made a dam
with arrows. Arjuna put this question to a great
scholar (Pandit) who was sitting nearby reading the
Rāmāyaṇa. Neither the Pandit nor the other brahmins
gathered there could give a convincing answer to Ar-
juna's doubts. Then a monkey child went up to Arjuna
and told him with pride that a dam made of arrows
would have broken when the monkeys walked on it.
Arjuna said then, “no, no, no monkey will be able to
break the dam built with Rāma's arrows; which monkey
will break a dam of arrows made even by me?” And,
a debate began about the subject. The monkey and
Arjuna agreed to a bet that if a monkey broke the dam
made by Arjuna he would end his life by jumping into
fire, and if the monkey could not break the dam it
would for ever be Arjuna's slave. Arjuna constructed
a dam with arrows. And, as soon as the monkey set
foot on it it was broken. Arjuna tried again. Though
now it caused some efforts on the part of the monkey
the dam broke this time also. Arjuna was thus left with
no alternative but to die by jumping into fire and a
fire was accordingly lit. Before Arjuna jumped into the
fire a brahmin boy, who was bathing in the river ran
[Page051-a+ 65]
upto Arjuna and told him that his attempt at self
annihilation was not justified as the bet was made with-
out an arbiter. When Arjuna who was wedded so
much to truth brushed aside this argument and got
ready to end his life the boy said: “If you are so very
insistent about it you (Arjuna and the monkey) com-
pete once again with me as arbiter. This suggestion of
the boy was accepted. The monkey child tried its best
to break the dam, but it failed. It developed its body
to the size of a mountain and jumped on the dam.
Even then it did not break. Then he ran up to the boy
who was acting as arbiter and prostrated at his feet
crying ‘Rāmacandra’. At the same moment Arjuna
also prostrated before the boy crying ‘Śrī Kṛṣṇa, slave
to devotees’. The boy asked both of them to get up,
and after admonishing them for their conceit gave them
good advice. He also asked the monkey child to keep
his word by remaining as the emblem of Arjuna's flag.
<div n="NI"/>(The monkey boy was actually Hanūmān and the
brahmin boy Śrī Kṛṣṇa).
<div n="NI"/>17C) {%Arjuna married Subhadrā.%} Arjuna went to the holy
place called Saubhadratīrtha and redeemed the woman
named Vargā from the curse she was labouring under.
(See Vargā). Arjuna continued his journey and reached
Gokarṇa and Prabhāsa tīrtha, where he met Gada,
brother of Śrī kṛṣṇa. Gada described to Arjuna the
great beauty of his sister, Subhadrā. Arjuna went to
Dvārakā and paid his respects to Śrī Kṛṣṇa. A few days
later the yādavas celebrated a great festival at mount
Raivataka. Arjuna went there disguised as a Sannyāsin
and forcibly took away Subhadrā with him with the
permission of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Though the yādavas got ready
for a fight they were ultimately pacified, and Subhadrā
was married to Arjuna. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter,
218-224).
<div n="NI"/>17D) {%Brahmin boy saved.%} When once Arjuna was in
Dvārakā with Śrī Kṛṣṇa a brahmin appeared on the
scene lamenting that his child died as soon as it was
born. Nobody paid any heed to this, and then Arjuna
rose up and assured protection to the next child to be
born to the brahmin and asked him to return home in
peace. Arjuna also vowed that he would end his life
by jumping into fire if he failed to protect the next
child of the brahmin.
<div n="NI"/>As the time for the delivery of his wife approached the
brahmin took Arjuna home. Arjuna made the house
secure by making an enclosure with his arrows. Yet
the child died; not only that, at the time of birth it-
self its body disappeared. And, the brahmin heaped
insults on Arjuna, who looked very foolish. Rendered
thus an object of ridicule Arjuna began to make a fire
for him to jump into. At this Śrī Kṛṣṇa appeared be-
fore Arjuna and prevented him from jumping into fire.
And then both Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna went to Viṣṇuloka
and submitted the case of the brahmin to him. Viṣṇu
told them: “Oh! Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, it was I who took
away the brahmin boys for the pleasure of seeing you
both here. You may immediately return with the brah-
min boys. And, Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna returned with the
boys to the brahmin, who now felt very happy.
(Bhāgavata, Daśama Skandha, Chapter 89).
<div n="NI"/>17E) {%Burning of Khāṇḍava forest.%} While Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna
were spending their days on the banks of river Yamunā
in the summer season Agni Bhagavān (the fire-god)
requested them to give the Khāṇḍava forest as food to
[Page051-b+ 65]
him. (See Khāṇḍavadāha). Arjuna agreed to oblige
Agni Bhagavān, who presented to Arjuna the bow
called Gāṇḍīva, a white horse and many other power-
ful arrows. When Agni began burning the forest, Indra
sent a heavy shower of rain. By creating a tent with
arrows Arjuna saved the forest from the rain. Arjuna
killed Takṣaka's wife, cursed the N ga called Aśvasena
and saved Maya, the architect of the Asuras who was
put up in the forest. Indra was pleased and gifted many
divine arrows to Arjuna. Maya gave the famous conch,
Devadattam to Arjuna. By now the one year of the
pilgrimage of Arjuna was over and he returned to
Indraprastha. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapters 233-239).
<div n="NI"/>17P) {%Fight between Arjuna and Śrī Kṛṣṇa.%} (See Gālava,
para 4).
<div n="NI"/>18) {%Again to the forest.%} Maya, who escaped death in
Khāṇḍava forest, in his great gratitude, went to Indra-
prastha, and with the permission of Dharmaputra built
for the Pāṇḍavas an exceptionally beautiful palace.
And then the Pāṇḍavas made the conquest of all the
earth, and after killing enemy kings like Jarāsandha,
the Kimpuruṣas, the Hādakas, Śiśupāla, Kurundha and
Bhagadatta returned to Idraprastha and performed
the Rājasūya yajña. The Kauravas who got jealous at
this went on a visit to Indraprastha. When they enter-
ed the palace built by Maya they were put into many
a ludicrous situation. (See Sabhāpraveśa). Insulted
and humiliated they returned to Hastināpura and
challenged the Pāṇḍavas to a game of dice, and in the
game the Pāṇḍavas lost not only their kingdom and
other riches, but Pāñcālī as well. Duśśāsana dragged
Pāñcālī and stripped her of her clothes in the royal
assembly and thus mercilessly insulted her. According
to the terms and condition agreed to with reference to
the game of dice, the Pāṇḍavas had to lead forest life
for twelve years and live for one year incognito. The
Pāṇḍavas again started for the forest. (M.B., Sabhā
Parva).
<div n="NI"/>19) {%Pāṇḍavas in Kāmyaka forest.%} A number of brahmins
also accompanied the Pāṇḍavas to the forest. The noble
brahmin, Śaunaka consoled the aggrieved Dharma-
putra in the Dvaitavana. Dharmaputra felt worried
that he could not feed the brahmins who accompanied
him into the forest. Pāñcālī prayed to the Sun-God,
and he gave the Akṣayapātra to her. (See Akṣyapātra).
And, after this the Pāṇḍavas, along with the brahmins,
entered the Kāmyaka forest. (M.B., Araṇya Parva,
Chapter 36).
<div n="NI"/>20) {%Arjuna secured divine arrows.%} Dharmaputra asked
Arjuna to do tapas in the Himālayas and thus secure
divine arrows. Accordingly Arjuna went south and saw
Indra in the Indrakīla mountain. Indra gave him
boons. There Arjuna killed Mūkāsura. And, then
Arjuna went to Mount Kailāsa and prayerfully concen-
trated his mind on Śiva. Śiva appeared in the guise of
a forest dweller. (See Pāśupatāstra). After that he got
the Daṇḍāstra from Yama, Pāśāstra from Varuṇa and
Antardhānāstra from Kubera. (M.B., Vana Parva,
Chapters 37-41).
<div n="NI"/>21) {%Arjuna in Indraloka.%} Indra, who was so very pleas-
ed that Arjuna got so many divine arrows deputed his
charioteer, Mātali, to bring Arjuna to Devaloka, and
at Devaloka he learned more about archery and music.
The Apsarā women forgot themselves when they saw
the exceptionally handsome Arjuna. Urvaśī, mad with
[Page052-a+ 65]
love, sent her messenger Citrasena to Indra. Being told
about Urvaśī's love Arjuna closed both his ears with
hands, and reminded the messenger of Urvaśī's mater-
nal position with reference to him. Urvaśī cursed and
turned Arjuna into an eunuch. Indra consoled Arjuna
by assuring him that Urvaśī's curse will turn out to be
of great benefit to him. Afterwards Arjuna stayed in
Devaloka for a few days with Citrasena, and during
the period he killed Nivātakavaca and Kālakeya.
<div n="NI"/>Arjuna became a friend of Maharṣi Lomaśa, who had
gone to Devaloka to see Indra. Promising Arjuna that
he would protect Dharmaputra Lomaśa returned to the
earth. Arjuna left the Kāmyaka forest and returned to
his brothers after an absence for five years. He met the
brothers at Mount Gandhamādana. (M.B., Vana Parva,
Chapters 42-47).
<div n="NI"/>22) {%Procession.%} At last a witty and humorous brahmin
went to Dhṛtarāṣṭra and dilated upon the hardships
being suffered by the Pāṇḍavas, and Duryodhana and
others were extremely pleased and happy to hear it.
Yet, they shed crocodile tears. But, Duryodhana was
in a mighty hurry to see with his own eyes the pitiable
plight of the Pāṇḍavas. On the pretext of going out for
hunting Duryodhana and others with the permission of
Dhṛtarāṣṭra, started for the forest with a number of
attendants. 8,000 chariots, 30,000 elephants, thousands
of infantry soldiers, 9,000 horses, merchants, ornaments,
courtesans and thousands of hunters formed this pro-
cession into the forest. Just like roaring winds during
the rainy season the procession caused thunderous noise.
Duryodhana approached the pool in the Dvaita forest
and waited at a distance. (M.B., Araṇya Parva, Chap-
ter 239, Verses 25-29).
<div n="NI"/>Duryodhana and attendants put up tents in the forest.
The Gandharvas obstructed Duryodhana, and he and
the Gandharva called Citrasena clashed with each
other. Duryodhana was made a prisoner. Arjuna came
on the scene and released him. And, thus humiliated
Duryodhana returned to Hastināpura with the atten-
dants. (M.B., Āraṇya Parva, Chapters 239-253).
<div n="NI"/>23) {%Arjuna lost consciousness.%} While once Pāñcālī was
alone King Jayadratha forcibly took her away. Within
seconds the Pāṇḍavas confronted Jayadratha and regain-
ed Pāñcālī. Jayadratha and his men were killed. The
Pāṇḍavas, who were very weary and tired walking in
the forest felt extremely thirsty. Nakula, at the instance
of Dharmaputra climbed a tree and looked around and
sighted a pool of clear water. When Nakula went to the
pool and began to draw water a voice from above was
heard saying as follows: “Do not be so very daring.
This is my ancestral wealth. If you answer my ques-
tions you may not only drink the water but also take
some with you”. Without paying any heed to this warn-
ing Nakula drank water from the pool, and lo! he fell
down unconscious immediately. Sahadeva who went to
the pool in search of Nakula and drank water from the
pool also met with the same fate as Nakula. Arjuna
and Bhīma also had the same fate at the pool. Lastly
Dharmaputra went to the pool and understanding what
happened to his brothers requested permission to drink
water. At once a Yakṣa appeared and brought the bro-
thers of Dharmaputra back to consciousness. In fact,
the Yakṣa was none other than Yamadharmadeva. (For
questions and answers of the Yakṣa see Dharmaputra.)
(M.B., Araṇya Parva, Chapters 312-315).
[Page052-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>24) {%Life incognito.%} Now the twelve years of forest life
being over the Pāṇḍavas decided to spend the one year
of life incognito in the Virāṭa palace. Arjuna disguised
himself and deposited his clothes and weapons in the
hollow of a Śami tree in the forest. And the Pāṇḍavas
in various disguises reached the Virāṭa palace. They
assumed false names: Dharmaputra as Kaṅka, Bhīma
as Valāla, Arjuna as Bṛhannala, Nakula as Granthika
and Sahadeva as Ariṣṭanemi and Draupadī as Mālinī.
<div n="NI"/>When the life incognito of the Pāṇḍavas for one year
was about to expire a rumour reached the Kauravas
that the Pāṇḍavas were at the Virāṭa capital, and the
Kauravas thought that the Pāṇḍavas will appear on the
scene if a war was fought against King Virāṭa. The
Kauravas, with this object in view, lifted the cows of
Virāṭa and that led to war. Uttara, the prince of Virāṭa
boasted that he would fight provided he had a good
charioteer. Bṛhannala (Arjuna) agreed to act as such
and they started for the warfield. At the sight of the
massive army of the Kauravas Uttara got frightened
and tried to run away from the field. But Bṛhannala
tightly bound Uttara to the chariot, drove it very fast
to the forest, took back from the hollow of the Śami
tree his weapons and returned to the battle-field. The
Kauravas were absolutely defeated in the war and they
took to their heels. They understood that the very clever
and terrible warrior in disguise was Arjuna himself. But,
by the time the period of the Pāṇḍavas life incognito
was over. The king of Virāṭa, greatly pleased over this
victory in war gave his daughter, Uttarā in marriage to
Abhiṃanyu, son of Arjuna. (M.B., Virāṭa Parva).
<div n="NI"/>25) {%Preparations for war.%} After the forest life and life
incognito the Pāṇḍavas returned. The Kauravas refus-
ed to give them half the Kingdom. Śrī Kṛṣṇa, on behalf
of the Pāṇḍavas, implored that half the kingdom or five
districts or five houses or at least one house be given to
them. But the Kauravas took the stand that not even
an iota of land would be given to the Pāṇḍavas. And,
war was perforce decided upon. Duryodhana went to
Kṛṣṇa at Dvārakā to request for support in war. Kṛṣṇa,
who favoured the Pāṇḍavas lay in false sleep as he did
not want to fight against them. Duryodhana sat at the
head of Kṛṣṇa. Arjuna, who came after some time sat
at the feet of Kṛṣṇa and remained there standing.
Awakening from sleep, it was Arjuna whom Kṛṣṇa saw
first. After the greetings were over with Arjuna, Kṛṣṇa
saw Duryodhana also. Between Kṛṣṇa without any arms
and the armed forces of Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna chose Kṛṣṇa
and Duryodhana his armed forces to help each side in
the impending war. (Udyoga Parva).
<div n="NI"/>26) {%War.%} Both the Parties were encamped in Kuruk-
ṣetra ready for war. Śrī Kṛṣṇa acted as Charioteer to
Arjuna. He stopped the chariot in between the opposing
armies. Arjuna felt deep anguish to find his own people
arrayed on the opposite side for war. Reluctant to kill
relations, elders, friends and preceptors Arjuna laid
down his arms in the chariot. Then did Kṛṣṇa instruct
him in Karmayoga (the philosophy of action). That
instruction and advice of Kṛṣṇa is the world-famous
Bhagavad Gītā. The Gītā cleared off Arjuna's illusions
and he praised the Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who revealed his
all comprehensive form (Viśvarūpa) to Arjuna.
<div n="NI"/>On the first day of the war Arjuna fought a duel with
Bhīṣma, and the second day he fought the Kaurava
forces with exceptional prowess. And then Arjuna pre-
[Page053-a+ 64]
vented Kṛṣṇa from killing Bhīṣma. But, the Kaurava
army faced defeat that day. On the third day Arjuna
defeated Bhīṣma, Aśvatthāmā, Trigartta, Bhagadatta
and others. Thereupon a really fierce fight began. The
war lasted for 18 days. The important incidents during
the 18 days can be summarised as follows:—

himself. But, regained mental peace by begging

(M.B., Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Karṇa, Śalya and Sauptika

<div n="NI"/>27) {%After the war.%} In the great war the Kaurava army,
to the very last man, was annihilated. The Pāṇḍavas
assembled together. Thoughts about the future came up.
Śrī Kṛṣṇa consoled the sorrowing Dharmaputra. As
desired by Vyāsa, Kṛṣṇa, Dharmaputra and others
returned to Hastināpura and took up the reins of
governing the country, and the idea of performing an
Aśvamedha Yāga was seriously mooted. A King named
Marutta agreed to give money needed for the yajña.
Arjuna defeated all enemy kings. (M.B., Śānti Parva).
<div n="NI"/>28) {%Death and rebirth of Arjuna.%} On his way back
after digvijaya Arjuna was killed by the arrows of his
son, Babhruvāhana. Immediately did Ulūpī, Arjuna's
wife bring back to life her husband by Mṛtasañjīvanī
mantra. Then Arjuna questioned Ulūpī about the
reason for his son killing him, and also as to how she
happened to be present at the time. Ulūpī described
the story of a curse in answer to Arjuna's querry.
(M.B., Aśvamedha Parva, Chapter 79).
<div n="NI"/>29) {%The story of the curse.%} Ulūpī said: You shall not
get angry. Yes, all is for the best. In war you killed
Bhīṣma by unrighteous means, viz. with the help of
Śikhaṇḍī. On his death, the Aṣṭavasus and Gaṅgā Devī
cursed you with hell. I told about this curse to my
father, who begged the Vasus for redemption, and they
said that you would be redeemed from the curse when
your son, Babhruvāhana, killed you. Accordingly he
has been brought here to kill you.
<div n="NI"/>The above story pleased Arjuna. (Aśvamedha Parva,
Chapter 81).
<div n="NI"/>30) {%Aśvamedham.%} Arjuna again defeated Meghasandhi,
the King of Magadha, Śakuniputra and others and
returned to Hastināpura, where the Aśvamedha yajña
was performed. The Yādava dynasty was extinguished
before long. Arjuna did all the rites due to them on
death. He grieved over the departure of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
(Bhāgavata, Skandha 11, Chapter 31). And then he
went to Indraprastha with the consorts of Kṛṣṇa. On
the way dacoits overcame Arjuna and snatched away
some of the females. Arjuna felt very sad. Then Vyāsa
appeared and told him that he would be strong and
powerful only in the presence of Kṛṣṇa. (Agni Purāṇa,
Chapter 15).
<div n="NI"/>31) {%Pāṇḍavas' journey to the other world.%} Now, it was
time for the Pāṇḍavas to journey to the other world.
[Page054-a+ 65]
It was at this juncture that the Yādava dynasty ended
and Śrī Kṛṣṇa was killed, and some of Kṛṣṇa's con-
sorts were abducted. Arjuna could not save them, and
they jumped into the river and died. Arjuna, who lost
all his power began the great journey with his brothers.
On their way Agnideva advised him to deposit reputed
bow, Gāṇḍīva in the sea, and Arjuna did so. (Mahā-
prasthāna Parva, Chapter 1, Verses 1-42). The Pāṇḍa-
vas continued their journey, Yudhiṣṭhira leading them.
They reached the Himālayas, and there Pāñcālī expir-
ed. To Bhīma's querry as to why Pāñcālī expired first,
Yudhiṣṭhira replied that it was due to her having been
more partial to Arjuna. The others continued their
journey and then Sahadeva died. Yudhiṣṭhira explain-
ed that Sahadeva died second due to his arrogance
and conceit. And, the others continued going forward.
An emaciated dog was already with the Pāṇḍavas
during their journey. Nakula was the third to die, and
Yudhiṣṭhira attributed it to his (Nakula) extreme con-
ceit about his beauty. And, Arjuna's death next,
Yudhiṣṭhira said, was due to his having not kept his
vow, once made, to kill the whole lot of enemies in a
day. After proceeding a short distance further Bhīma
also fell dead, and Yudhiṣṭhira thought to himself
that it was due to Bhīma's voracious eating. And, then
Devendra came in his chariot of gold and welcomed
Yudhiṣṭhira to Svarga. But, he refused the offer saying
that he would not do go alone, leaving his brothers
behind. When Indra assured him that his brothers
were already there, in Svarga, Yudhiṣṭhira got into
the chariot and reached Svarga, and he was elated to
find his brothers there happy with Pāñcālī. (Mahā-
prasthāna Parva and Svargārohaṇa).

<div n="NI"/>34) {%Origin of certain words.%} Towards the close of his
life incognito, Arjuna went to the Śami tree to take
out Gāṇḍīva kept in its hollow. Uttarā also was
with Arjuna. Then Arjuna revealed himself to Uttarā,
and also elaborated the meaning of his various names
as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>I shall tell you my ten names. Arjuna, Phālguna, Jiṣṇu,
Kirīṭi, Śvetavāhana, Bhībhatsu, Vijaya, Kṛṣṇa, Savya-
sācī and Dhanañjaya....I am called Dhanañjaya,
because even after having conquered all the lands and
amassed wealth I stand in the centre of righteousness
....I am called Vijaya because in fights with haughty
opponents I always succeed.....I am called Śvetavāhana
because white horses are harnessed in war to my chariot
decked with golden ornaments....I am called Phāl-
guna because I was born in the month of Phālguna and
under the star, Phālguna...I am kirīṭī because during
my fight with the Daityas I put on my head crown
glowing as Sun...I am called Bībhatsu by men and
Devas because I never resort to revolting means during
war...Devas and men call me Savyasācī because both
my hands are adept in using the bow, Gāṇḍīva....I
am Arjuna because, in the world people are rare who
possess such fair colour as I do, and moreover I do
only white (just and ethical) acts....I am called Jiṣṇu,
because I am unassailable and unconquerable, and I
subjugate and conquer, and also because I am the son of
Indra...My father gave me the tenth name of Kṛṣṇa
because I was very attractive (Kṛṣṇa=attractive).
