SUŚĪLĀ II¦. A cow, the sister of Surabhi. She was the
cow used in connection with sacrificial offerings made in
the āśrama of the sage Jamadagni.
<div n="NI"/>Jamadagni once got his wife Reṇukā killed by Paraśu-
rāma. Though he brought her back to life as desired by
Paraśurāma, Jamadagni felt deep sorrow for having got
his wife killed. So, he went to Goloka and pleased
Surabhi by his penance and she gave him Suśīlā, her
sister. Jamadagni gave the cow (Suśīlā) to Reṇukā. It
was this Suśīlā which later on Karttavīryajuna took away
[Page774-a+ 65]
by force. (See under Jamadagni, Para 8). (Brahmāṇḍa
Purāṇa, Chapter 61);
