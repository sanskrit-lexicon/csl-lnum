UDDHAVA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} A Yādava. He was a friend and
minister of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. In Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva,
Chapter 186, Stanza 18, mention is made that Uddhava
was present on the occasion of the Svayaṃvara (marriage)
of Draupadī. It is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Ādi
Parva, Chapter 218, Stanza 11, that at a famous cele-
bration held in the mountain of Raivata, Uddhava was
present. (See under Subhadrā).
<div n="NI"/>Uddhava was a disciple of Bṛhaspati, and a man of
great intelligence. It was this Uddhava who brought the
dowry of Subhadrā to Indraprastha, when Arjuna
married her. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 220, Stanza
30).
<div n="NI"/>Once a king named Śālva besieged the city of Dvār-
akā. At that time Uddhava saved Dvārakā. (M.B.
Vana Parva, Chapter 15, Stanza 9).
<div n="NI"/>2). {%The message carried by Uddhava.%} Kaṃsa sent Akrūra
to Ambāḍi, and brought Śrī Kṛṣṇa to Mathurā. Śrī
Kṛṣṇa killed Kaṃsa and made Ugrasena king, and
stayed in the city of Mathurā for a time. At that time
Śrī Kṛṣṇa sent Uddhava to Ambāḍi to know about the
well-being of the people there. The moment Uddhava
entered Ambāḍi, the Gopas and gopa women, (cow-
herds) Yaśodā and Nandagopa, all surrounded him to
hear about Śrī Kṛṣṇa. They felt much pleased at
knowing that Śrī Kṛṣṇa was getting on well. They sent
through him many presents to Śrī Kṛṣṇa. He got
all those presents into his chariot and took them to
Śrī Kṛṣṇa in Mathurā. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 10).
<div n="NI"/>3). {%The end.%} Śrī Kṛṣṇa informed Uddhava before-
hand the fact that the Yādava dynasty was going
[Page804-a+ 64]
to end. Uddhava felt grief and requested Śrī Kṛṣṇa
to take him also to Vaikuṇṭha (the abode of Mahāviṣṇu).
Śrī Kṛṣṇa taught Uddhava the doctrine that the body
of man and such other things seen in the whole universe
were nothing but mere delusion. At that time Uddhava
asked Śrī Kṛṣṇa twentyone questions about Bandha
and Mokṣa (Bondage and deliverance).
<div n="NI"/>To all these questions Srī Kṛṣṇa gave him satisfactory
answers. (Bhāgavata Skandha 11).
<div n="NI"/>Before the destruction of Dvārakā, the Yadus left the
city. They went to Prabhāsatīrtha, a place on the sea
coast and lived there. Uddhava who knew that the
destruction was imminent, bade farewell to them and
walked away alone. He was filled with a brightness.
Śrī Kṛṣṇa did not stop him. (M.B. Mausala Parva,
Chapter 3).
<div n="NI"/>It is stated in Bhāgavata, Skandha 11, Chapter 29,
that Uddhava went to the hermitage of Badarikā and
engaged himself in penance.
