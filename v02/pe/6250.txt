SAPTAMĀTṚ¦(S). (SEVEN MOTHERS).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Saptamātṛs are the seven
goddesses named Brahmāṇī, Vaiṣṇavī, Māheśvarī,
Kaumārī, Vārāhī, Indrāṇī and Cāmuṇḍī.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Origin.%} Some are of opinion that the Saptamātṛs
are connected with Śiva. Their names reveal that they
were born from the bodies of Brahmā, Viṣṇu and such
other gods. There is another story that when Śiva and
Viṣṇu joined together and tried to kill the asura named
Andhaka and failed, they created the seven mothers to
kill the asura. From each drop of blood of Andhakāsura
that fell on the ground an asura arose. These seven
mātṛs joined with Yogeśvarī, the creation of Śiva,
drank the blood of the asura without allowing it to
fall on the ground and so it became easy for Śiva to
kill the asura.
<div n="NI"/>There is a story in Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 56,
about the birth of the Saptamātṛs, as follows: In
olden days a fierce war broke out between the devas
and the asuras. When the fierce asuras Caṇḍa and
Muṇḍa were killed the famous asura named Raktabīja
[Page691-b+ 64]
entered the battlefield with an akṣauhiṇī of army
(21870 chariots, so many elephants, 65610 horses and
109350 infantry). Seeing this immense army of the
asuras drawing near, Kauśikī, Maheśvarī and Kālīmade
a loud roaring sound. Then from the mouth of
Maheśvarī, Brahmāṇī came out seated on a swan and
wearing rosary and water pot. From her eyes Maheś-
varī with three eyes came out seated on a bull and
wearing great snakes as bangles and ear-rings and
holding a trident. From the loins came out Kaumārī,
seated on a peacock and holding a lance. The beauti-
ful Vaiṣṇavī came out from her hand, seated on
Garuḍa, holding a conch, discus, club, sword, the bow
śārṅga and arrow. From her posterior came out the
horrible Vārāhī (Boar) with a great pestle, seated on
the Nāga (serpent) Śeṣa, and furrowing the ground
with her fierce tusks. From her heart came out the
awful Nārasiṃhī (woman-lion) with fierce claws, who
at the shaking of her mane displaced the planets and
the stars, and from her foot Cāmuṇḍī came out. (See
under Palālā).
