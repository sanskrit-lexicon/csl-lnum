VIṢṆUCITTA¦. A noble Vaiṣṇavite devotee, who lived
in Tamil Nadu. He lived in Villiputtur. It is said that
he was the incarnation of Garuḍa. Viṣṇucitta had ano-
ther name Periyālvār. Āṇḍāl who was famous among
the Ālvārs was the daughter of Viṣṇucitta.
<div n="NI"/>Viṣṇucitta sang holy hymns in praise of the beloved
god. The hymns of praise he sang are called Pallāṇḍu.
He got the name Periyālvār or the foremost of the devo-
tees.
<div n="NI"/>Once at Villiputtur, while he was getting beds ready to
plant holy basil, he was attracted by a divine infant. It
seemed to Viṣṇucitta that the little girl was lying among
the basil plants. He took the child home and named
her Godā. It was this Godā who became the famous
Āṇḍāl later. Legends say that the birth of Āṇḍāl was
in 97 Kali Era. Scholars say that Godā was born in the
middle of 7th century. There is another story which
mentions that Āṇḍāl was born from a portion of
Goddess Earth.
