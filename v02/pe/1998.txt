DHṚTARĀṢṬRA¦. I. Father of the Kauravas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} (See the genealogy of Arjuna).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Śantanu, a king of the Lunar dynasty, had
two wives Gaṅgā and Satyavatī. Gāṅgā, gave birth to
eight sons. But seven of them were thrown into the
river Gaṅgā. Giving the eighth son Bhīṣma to Śantanu
Gaṅgā disappeared. Śantanu then married Satyavatī,
a fisher-woman. Satyavatī gave birth to two sons, Cit-
rāṅgada and Vicitravīrya. When Śantanu grew old,
Citrāṅgada was anointed as King, as Bhīṣma had taken
Brahmavrata (vow of celibacy). Once when Citrāṅ-
gada went to the forest for hunting, a Gandharva of the
name Citrāṅgada killed him. So Vicitravīrya became
the King of Hastināpura. Bhīṣma took the three daugh-
ters of the King of Kāśi, Ambā, Ambikā and Ambālikā
[Page236-a+ 65]
by force into his chariot and brought the last two, to
Hastināpura to be given as wives to Vicitravīrya. On
the way he sent Ambā back. Vicitravīrya married Am-
bikā and Ambālikā. But shortly after that he also died,
before any children were born to him. Fearing that the
Lunar dynasty would come to an end, Satyavatī brought
her son Vedavyāsa, who was born to her from hermit
Parāśara, before her marriage, to Hastināpura. In the
night Satyavatī sent Ambikā adorned with ornaments
and costly garments, to the bedroom of Vyāsa. But she
could not bear to lie with Vyāsa who was clad in barks
of the tree and wearing matted hair. Still thinking that
it was not right on her part to stand against the wish of
her mother, she approached Vyāsa and lay with him
with closed eyes. Ambikā became pregnant. The child
she gave birth to, was blind. That child was Dhṛtarāṣṭṛa.
Next night Ambālikā approached Vyāsa. When she
saw Vyāsa she turned pale at his uncouth figure and
her face became bloodless. So the child born to her was
pale and was called Pāṇḍu. Next night the maid of the
queen approached Vyāsa with a joyful heart and so she
got Vidura as son, who was extremely wise and intelli-
gent. Thus Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Pāṇḍu and Vidura became sons
of the same father.
<F>1. It is stated in M.B. Āśramavāsika Parva, Chapter 31, Stanza 7 that Dhṛtarāṣṭra was born as the incarnation of a Gandharva
having the name Dhṛtarāṣṭra. (See under Dhṛtarāṣṭra III).</F> (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapters, 63
and 105).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Up to marriage.%} After the birth of Dhṛtarāṣṭra Vyāsa
returned to forest and since then Bhīṣma stood in place
of father to the children. Bhīṣma performed ‘Upanay-
ana’ (investiture with Brahma-string) and other rites
of the children. Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Pāṇḍu and Vidura had
their education in Hastināpura. (M.B. Ādi Parva,
Chapter 108).
<Poem>“Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Pāṇḍu and the wise Vidura
The three were brought up as sons by Bhīṣma,
They became well educated, cultured and devotional,
Respectful towards vows and fasts, and
of good physique earnest in work
And they became valiant youths.
Learned the Vedas and Veda of archery,
Clubbing, shield and swords play,
Elephant-keeping, laws of chastisement,
Veda śāstras, allied works and epics and the Purāṇas,
Pāṇḍu came out expert archer,
Dhṛtarāṣṭra the strongest of all.
None in the three worlds was equal to Vidura,
In wisdom and knowledge and righteousness.”
(M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 109).</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>Because of his blindness Dhṛtarāṣṭra was not anointed
as King. It is stated in M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 108
Stanza 25, that in the place of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Pāṇḍu was
anointed the King.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Marriage and birth of children.%} Dhṛtarāṣṭra came of
marriageable age. Bhīṣma had heard about Gāndhārī,
daughter of Subala, the King of Gāndhāra, as a beauti-
ful damsel of good qualities. Moreover she had acquired
a boon from Śiva that hundred sons would be born to
her. Bhīṣma sent a messenger to Subala with a request
to give Gāndhārī as wife to Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Subala was
not much pleased at the aspect of getting a blind man
as son-in-law. Still he thought of the prestige his family
would get by a marriage alliance with the kings of the
Pūru Dynasty, and finally agreed. Gāndhārī submitted
to the will of her father, and to live with a husband who
[Page236-b+ 63]
was blind. She tied her eyes with a cloth. Śakuni the
son of Subala brought Gāndhārī to Hastināpura, and
gave her to Dhṛtarāṣṭra. With the sanction of Bhīṣma
their marriage took place.
<div n="NI"/>Once Gāndhārī feasted Vyāsa who came tired with hun-
ger and thirst. The hermit was pleased with her and
blessed her to have hundred sons. Gāndhārī became
pregnant. But even after two years no delivery took place.
She crushed her womb by force and a lump of flesh
came out. At that time Vyāsa came there. He cut the
lump into hundred pieces and kept them in ghee-pots.
Gandhārī had a desire to get a daughter also. Vyāsa
who had known it had cut the lump in such a way that
there was a small piece in excess. The pots broke by
themselves in due course and hundred sons and a
daughter were born. The daughter was named Duśśalā.
A son named Yuyutsu also was born to Dhṛtarāṣṭra of a
Vaiśya woman. Duryodhana was the eldest of the
hundred sons. The children grew up. Duśśalā was
given in marriage to Jayadratha, the King of Sindhu.
(M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapters 109 to 116).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Till Bhārata-battle.%} At this juncture Pāṇḍu incurred
a curse from a hermit that he would die if his wife tou-
ched him. With that Pāṇḍu retired to forest with his
wives. Dhṛtarāṣṭra was grieved at the separation of
his brother. Pāṇḍu died in the forest and Mādrī jumped
into fire and died with her husband. Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked
Vidura to perform their cremation rites. After that
Yudhiṣṭhira became King. The Pāṇḍavas became more
and more prosperous. This made the heart of Dhṛtarāṣṭra
cloudy. He gave sanction to Duryodhana to transfer the
Pāṇḍavas to the lac house in Vāraṇāvata. The lac house
caught fire and it was rumoured that the Pāṇḍavas died
in the lac house fire, and Dhṛtarāṣṭra shed crocodile
tears, and ordered for the mourning and oblation to
be performed. After the marriage of Pāñcālī, it came to
be known that the Pāṇḍavas were alive and that they
were living with Drupada. Dhṛtarāṣṭra recalled them and
gave them half of the country. The Pāṇḍavas made
Indraprastha their capital and began to rule the king-
dom. Yudhiṣṭhira performed the sacrifice of Rājasūya
(royal consecration). Dhṛtarāṣṭra also took part in the
sacrifice.
<div n="NI"/>Duryodhana wanted to challenge Yudhiṣṭhira to a
game of dice. Dhṛtarāṣṭra agreed but advised Duryo-
dhana not to live in enmity with the Pāṇḍavas. The
game of dice was played, and Yudhiṣṭhira lost every-
thing the Pāṇḍavas had. Dhṛtarāṣṭra called Pāñcālī
and told her that she might ask any boon. She request-
ed that her husband Dharmaputra might be exempt-
ed from servitude and the Pāṇḍavas made free. Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra compelled her to ask for more boons. She replied
that according to law Vaiśyas were eligible for one boon,
Kṣatriya women two boons, Kings three boons and
Brāhmaṇas hundred boons, and since she had already
taken two boons, she wanted no more. Dhṛtarāṣṭra who
was pleased at this reply gave the Pāṇḍavas freedom
and returned all their lost wealth.
<div n="NI"/>Duryodhana wanted to challenge the Pāṇḍavas for a
game of dice again. Dhṛtarāṣṭra agreed. This time also
Yudhiṣṭhira lost the game. The Pāṇḍavas who had lost
everything, were ordered to go to forest for twelve years
and to live incognito for one year. The Pāṇḍavas went
[Page237-a+ 65]
to the forest with Pāñcālī. Dhṛtarāṣṭra was grieved.
<div n="NI"/>After thirteen years the Pāṇḍavas returned. Duryo-
dhana said that not an inch of land would be given to
the Pāṇḍavas. Dhṛtarāṣṭra felt sorry at this Śrī Kṛṣṇa
came to talk about conciliation. Duryodhana wanted to
take him a prisoner. But Dhṛtarāṣṭra opposed it. Śrī
Kṛṣṇa showed Dhṛtarāṣṭra his Viśvarūpa (cosmic form)
to see which, Kṛṣṇa gave him sight for the time being
for which Dhṛtarāṣṭra was very thankful. The Pāṇḍavas
and the Kauravas came to Kurukṣetra for Bhārata-battle.
Dhṛtarāṣṭra called Sañjaya to him and asked him about
the preparations the parties had made for war. Sañjaya
gave a true description of the battle arrays of both
parties. (M.B. Ādi Parva. Sabhā Parva, Vana Parva,
and Udyoga Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(6) {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra and the battle of Bhārata.%} The terrible
battle began. The heart of Dhṛtarāṣṭra was grieved with
sorrow. When Arjuna vowed that he would kill Jaya-
dratha, Dhṛtarāṣṭra cried aloud. When he knew that
Śātyaki had destroyed the army of the Kauravas he
became dumb with grief. He praised Bhīma's valour
and blamed his sons. When Sañjaya told him
about the fall of Karṇa, Dhṛtarāṣṭra fell down
unconscious. He rose up again and attended to the
noises from the battlefield. He fell down again when
he knew that Śalya and Duryodhana were killed. He
rose again and cried for a long time. He gathered the
women-folk, his people and went to the battlefield.
He broke the metal statue of Bhīma and embraced the
Pāṇḍavas. He asked Yudhiṣṭhira to do the mourning
and offerings for the dead. It was done accordingly.
The Pāṇḍavas respected Dhṛtarāṣṭra. But Bhīma
scolded them. Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Gāndhārī were greatly
depressed and asked Yudhiṣṭhira to permit them to live
in forest. Yudhiṣṭhira tried to prevent it. He kissed on
the head of Yudhiṣṭhira. Seeing that they did not eat
food he asked them to eat. Yudhiṣṭhira saw that they
would eat only if he permitted them to live in forest.
At last Yudhiṣṭhira agreed. Dhṛtarāṣṭra accepted
money from Dharmaputra and performed mourning
and offerings for the dead on a large scale (M.B. Droṇa
Parva, Karṇa Parva, Strī Parva, Śānti Parva and
Āśramavāsika Parva).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Journey to forest and death.%} Afterwards Dhṛtarāṣṭra
and Gāndharī went to forest. Kunti followed them.
All the subjects followed them a long way, crying.
Dhṛtarāṣṭra sent them back and entrusted the teacher
Kṛpa and Yuyutsu with the Pāṇḍavas. Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
Gāndhārī and Kuntī lived on the Ganges. From there
they came to Kurukṣetra and lived in the hermitage of
Śatayūpā for a time. During that period Nārada
visited them. The Pāṇḍavas and the subjects visited
them again. Vyāsa also came there. He took Dhṛtarā-
ṣṭra and the rest of them to the river Ganges and
evoked the spirits of those who died in the battle.
Vyāsa gave Dhṛtarāṣṭra divine eye to see the departed
spirits. After this, at the request of Vyāsa they all
returned. Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Gāndhārī and Kuntī went to
Gaṅgādvāra and performed severe penance and were
burnt to death in a wild fire. The relatives put their
remains in the Ganges. The spirits of the three—Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra, Gāndhārī and Kuntī entered the realm of
Kubera. (M.B. Āśramavāsika Parva, Svargārohaṇa
Parva).
