KAIṬABHA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Kaiṭabha was the brother of
Madhu, an Asura (demon). These two brothers are
known in the Purāṇas as Madhu-Kaiṭabhas.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Origin.%} In the Purāṇas, two stories slightly different
from each other, occur about the birth of Madhu and
Kaiṭabha. One story occurs in Devī Bhāgavata,
Skandha 10 and the other in Mahābhārata, Śānti
Parva. In Devī Purāṇa, Chapter 1, it is stated as
follows:—
<div n="NI"/>In the beginning there was no earth or any other
planet. There was only water. Mahāviṣṇu slept on the
surface of the water. From the navel of Mahāviṣṇu the
stalk of a lotus grew up and there was a lotus flower
at the end of the stalk. Brahmā was born in the lotus
flower. Brahmā stayed in the flower in deep meditation
reciting the Vedas. Ear-wax flowed out from both the
ears of Mahāviṣṇu. From the ear-wax two Asuras
Madhu and Kaiṭabha were born.
<div n="NI"/>The following occurs in the Mahābhārata, Śānti
Parva, Chapter 348 about the birth of Madhu-
Kaiṭabhas.
<div n="NI"/>A lotus flower grew up from the navel of Mahāviṣṇu
and Brahmā was born in the flower. In the flower there
were two drops of water created by Mahāviṣṇu. One
drop was as sweet as honey and from that drop was
born the Asura Madhu with the attributes of tamas
[Page365-b+ 65]
(darkness). The other drop was hard and from it
Kaiṭabha was born with the attribute of Rajas
(activity).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Madhu-Kaiṭabhas’ acquiring boons.%} Madhu-Kaiṭabhas
were born in water, grew up in water and walked on
the surface of water, haughty and arrogant. They
began to think about how the big flood of water came
into existence. Then Devī appeared before them and
taught them the mantra or incantation of Vāgbīja
(origin of logos). Reciting this mantra, Madhu and
Kaiṭabha worshipped Devī for thousand years. Devī
appeared and asked them what they wished. They
wanted the boon that death should befall them only as
they desired. Devī granted them the boon. After this
they became haughtier because of the boon, and lived
in the water playing with the creatures in water having
nobody to confront them (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 1).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The theft of the Vedas.%} Madhu Kaiṭabhas saw
Brahmā lying in the lotus flower reciting the four
Vedas which he had created. They caught hold of all
the Vedas and went to Pātāla, (the nether world) and
hid themselves there. Brahmā grew sad at the loss of
the Vedas and followed Madhu-Kaiṭabhas, who began
to attack Brahmā. At this Brahmā became terribly
afraid of the Asuras and ran to Mahāviṣṇu who was
lying in a deep sleep of contemplation. Brahmā praised
him. Mahāviṣṇu woke up. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha
10).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The death of Madhu and Kaiṭabha.%} According to the
request of Brahmā, Mahāviṣṇu confronted Madhu and
Kaiṭabha. Madhu engaged Viṣṇu in fighting while
Kaiṭabha took rest and when Madhu became tired,
Kaiṭabha engaged Viṣṇu in fighting. Thus the fight
went on for a long time and Viṣṇu became tired of
continuous fight. Viṣṇu understood that owing to the boon
given by Devī the Asuras would die only if they wished
for death, and that no body could kill them. So Viṣṇu
began to meditate on Devī, who said “It would never
be possible for you to kill Madhu and Kaiṭabha
because of my boon. They could be killed only by
deceit. So you may kill them deceitfully”.
<div n="NI"/>Hearing these words Mahāviṣṇu approached the Asuras
and said to them. “I am much pleased with you. So
you may ask for any boon.” Hearing this they laughed
and said that they were more powerful than Viṣṇu
and that he might ask of them any boon. Taking that
opportunity Mahāviṣṇu said “Oh ! powerful persons.
I ask you to grant me this boon. Give me the boon to
kill you.” This request shook them. They were willing
to be killed at any place except water. They thought
that Viṣṇu would not be powerful enough to kill them.
Mahāviṣṇu instantly raised his thighs which were
enlarged to a great extent over the water as solid earth
seeing which the Asuras enlarged their bodies to the
extent of a thousand yojanas. But Mahāviṣṇu enlarged
his thighs further, caught hold of Madhu and Kaiṭa-
bha, laid them on his thighs and cut off their heads
with his discus. All the surface of the sea was covered
with the medas (fat) of these Asuras. This medas of
Madhu and Kaiṭabha collected itself into a lump and
became the earth. So the earth got the name ‘Medinī’.
As the earth was the fat of the Asuras it was not fit for
food. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 1).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%The so of Madhu-Kaiṭabhas.%} A horrible son named
Dhundhu was born to Madhu-Kaiṭabhas. He lived
[Page366-a+ 64]
under the sand in a wilderness called Ujjālakam. A
King of the Ikṣvāku family named Kuvalayāśva killed
Dhundhu. So Kuvalayāśva got the name Dhundhu-
māra. See under Dhundhu. (Mahābhārata, Vana
Parva, Chapter 202). (Khara and Atikāya are the
rebirths of Madhu and Kaiṭabha. See under Atikāya).
