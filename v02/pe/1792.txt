DATTĀTREYA¦. (DATTA). A hermit famous in the
purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Anasūyā, the wife of hermit Atri gave birth
to Dattātreya. But Dattātreya was the incarnation of
Mahāviṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>There is a story in Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa how Mahā-
viṣṇu came to incarnate as Dattātreya.
<div n="NI"/>Once there was a hermit called Aṇimāṇḍavya (Māṇḍa-
vya). While the hermit was engaged in silent medi-
tation, some robbers passed by that way. The King's
men who were chasing the robbers, came to the hermit
and asked him about the robbers. The hermit did not
break the silence. The King's men, thinking the hermit
to be the thief bound his hands and legs and took him to
the palace. The King ordered Māṇḍavya to be killed by
piercing his body with a trident. Accordingly a trident
was posted on a hill far away and Māṇḍavya was seated
[Page206-b+ 64]
on the tip of it. Māṇḍavya lay there in agony.
<div n="NI"/>It was at this time that Śīlavatī, famous for her conjugal
fidelity, went to the house of a harlot, carrying her
husband Ugraśravas on her shoulder. When they passed
by that way Ugraśravas scolded Aṇimāṇḍavya; getting
angry at this Aṇimāṇḍavya cursed Ugraśravas that he
would get his head broken and die before the sun-rise.
Sīlavatī became very sorry when she heard the curse
and she also cursed. “Let the sun not rise tomorrow”.
The sun did not rise next day. Everything in the world
was in chaos. The devas were flurried. They went to
Brahmā. Brahmā took them to Śiva. They could not
find a solution. So all of them approached Mahāviṣṇu.
The Trimūrtis (three gods) told the devas that the
problem would be solved, and the devas returned.
Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśvara went to Śīlavatī. Before
seeing Śīlavatī, they went to Anasūyā the wife of Atri
and sought her help to persuade Śīlavatī to recall her
curse. Thus Anasūyā and the Trimūrtis approached
Śīlavatī and spoke compassionate and consolatory words.
At last Śīlavatī recalled the curse. The Trimūrtis con-
vinced Śīlavatī, that Ugraśravas would not die. The
pleased Trimūrtis asked Anasūyā to ask for any boon. She
replied that she did not want any boon except that the
Trimūrtis should take birth as her sons. Accordingly
Mahāviṣṇu took birth as Dattātreya, Śiva as Durvāsas
and Brahmā as Candra, in the womb of Anasūyā. This
is how Dattātreya was born.
<F>1. Dattātreya is known by the name ‘Datta’ also in the Purāṇas.</F> Dattātreya did penance
from his childhood and became a hermit. (Brahmāṇḍa
Purāṇa, Chapters 39 to 44).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Kārtavīryārjuna and Dattātreya.%} When Kārtavīryār-
juna became King Dattātreya had become very famous.
Kārtavīryārjuna wanted to obtain supernatural powers.
So he called the hermit Garga and asked for his advice.
Garga advised him that Dattātreya was the incarnation
of Viṣṇu and that he would grant his wishes. So Kārta-
vīryārjuna and his wife came to the river Narmadā,
and taking bath in the river, began to worship Dattā-
treya, who was doing penance closeby. Dattātreya
was pleased and went to Kārtavīryārjuna and asked him
what his desire was. He requested for thousand hands
and to be a youth for ever, and such other things.
Dattātreya granted his wishes. After that Kārtavīryār-
juna would very often go to the hermit Dattātreya for
his advice. (Brahma Purāṇa, Chapter 44).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Cursing Rāvaṇa.%} Once Rāvaṇa went to the hermit-
age of Dattātreya. The hermit had placed a waterpot
purified by reciting spells and incantations. Rāvaṇa
stole that waterpot. When the hermit knew this, he
cursed Rāvaṇa saying, “Since the water, which was
evoked by spells and incantations, has fallen on your
head, Monkeys will pollute your head by treading on
it.” (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Exhortation to the Sādhyas.%} Mention is made in Mahā-
bhārata, Udyoga Parva, Chapter 36, Stanza 4, that the
hermit Dattātreya gave exhortations to the Sādhyas (the
sons of Dharmadeva by his wife Sādhyā).
<div n="NI"/>5) A boon for the birth of Nahuṣa. See Nahuṣa.
