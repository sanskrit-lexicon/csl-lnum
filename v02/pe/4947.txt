PAÑCABHŪTA¦. Pṛthvī (earth), Ap (water), Tejas
(fire), Vāyu (air) and Ākāśa (ether) are the Pañca-
bhūtas (five elements). The whole visible world is com-
posed of one or more of these five elements. This is
called the Pāñcabhautikasiddhānta (doctrine of five ele-
ments). Besides these five dravyas (elementary subs-
tance), people in Bhārata have reckoned Time, space,
soul and mind also as Padārthas or categories. Dravya,
one of the seven categories according to Nyāya Vaiśeṣika-
sūtras, has nine svabhāvas (inherent properties). The
seven Padārthas of Vaiśeṣika are Dravya, Guṇa, Karman
Sāmānya, Viśeṣa, Samavāya and Abhāva.

<div n="NI"/>The word ‘Padārtha’ has got a very wide meaning. The
word ‘matter’ in English cannot indicate the full signi-
ficance of the word Padārtha. Kaṇāda in his Vaiśeṣika
sūtras has given the name ‘Artha’ combining in it the
three svabhāvas, Dravya, Guṇa and Karman. Of the
above seven padārthas Praśastapāda, the famous logic-
ian, has included only the first six in his book
‘Padārthadharma Saṃgraha’. The Vaiśeṣikas of a later
period included ‘abhāva’ also and raised the number
of arthas to seven. Gautama, the Nyāyasūtrakāra and
Vātsyāyana, the Nyāyabhāṣyakāra, and all their followers
accepted the number of arthas as seven.
<div n="NI"/>All that can be perceived by the senses are includ-
ed in the seven Padārthas according to the sys-
tems of Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika. Excepting abhāva all the
other six are bhāvas. Kaṇāda has dealt with ‘abhāva’
but has not treated it as a category. Praśastapāda has not
mentioned about ‘abhāva’ at all. Gautama deals with six-
teen Padārthas. The Mīmāṃsakas take into account only
five Padārthas and the Sāṅkhyas count only two
Padārthas viz., Prakṛti and Puruṣa. Advaitavādins re-
ckon only two Padārthas and to them they are Cit and
Jaḍa (Ātmā and Anātman). Viśiṣṭādvaitins add god
also to the above and make the number of Padārthas
three.

According to Nyāya Vaiśeṣikasūtras there are seven
Padārthas and they comprise nine kinds of Dravyas which
are the Pañcabhūtas (five elements), Kāla (time), Dik
(space), Ātmā (soul), and Manas (mind). They are
described below:
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Pṛthvī. (earth).%} The characteristic of this padārtha
is smell. Pṛthvī is of two kinds, Nitya (eternal) and
Anitya (perishable). Nitya is in the form of atom
(paramāṇu) and anitya in the form of Kārya. They
are classified into body, sense organs and objects.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Jala (water).%} Jala has a cold touch. It is of two
kinds Nitya and Anitya. Nitya is in the form of paramāṇu
(atom); Anitya in the form of Kārya.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Agni (fire).%} It generates heat. It is of two kinds,
Nitya and Anitya. Nitya is in the form of paramāṇu
and Anitya, in the form of Kārya. There are four kinds
of Agnis: Fire of the earth, fire of the sky, fire of the
stomach (digestive power) and the fire commonly used.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Vāyu (air).%} It is without form but with the sense
of touch. It is also of two kinds. Nitya in the form of
paramāṇu and Anitya in the form of Kārya.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Ākāśa (ether).%} This is the carrier of sound. It is
single and eternal.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Kāla (time).%} It is general cause for all actions em-
bracing the elements. It is also single and eternal.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Dik.%} Places like north, south, east and west which
are eternal.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Ātmā (soul).%} It is related to knowledge and is of
two kinds, Jīvātmā and Paramātmā.
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Manas (mind).%} It is the sense-organ to enjoy
pleasures. It is in the form of paramāṇu and eternal.
