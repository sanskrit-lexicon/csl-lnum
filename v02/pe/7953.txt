VALA¦ (BALA). An asura. It is stated in Padma Purāṇa,
Bhūmikhaṇḍa, how Indra killed this asura.
<div n="NI"/>One day Vala went to the sea for his evening worship.
Devendra saw the asura, shining with the radiance
of celibacy and the divine rod and deer-hide, praying
on the sea-shore. Instantly Indra cut him into two with
his weapon, the thunderbolt. Vala fell down motionless.
Mention is made about this asura in Ṛgveda, Maṇḍala
1, Anuvāka 4. (For further details see under Bala).
