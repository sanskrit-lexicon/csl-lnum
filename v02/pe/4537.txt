MITHILĀ¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} A celebrated country of ancient
Bhārata. This is situated on the north-eastern side of
Bhārata. Its modern name is Tirhut. Mithilā was ruled
by the renowned Janaka Kings. See under Mithi to
know how the country got the name Mithilā.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The-wealth of Mithilā.%} Mithilā was the capital of the
extensive country of Videha. Successive generations of
Janaka ruled the country. Mithilā was noted more for
its sāttvic virtues than for the pomp and glory of kings.
Everyday on the protruding breasts of an idol of
Rājasa-rājalakṣmī (embodiment of royal prosperity)
bhasma (ashes) and candana (sandalwood paste) would
be smeared. In the middle of Tretāyuga Videha was
ruled by a Janaka who brought fame and prosperity to
the successive generations. A devotee of Śiva and of a
sāttvic disposition he was a Nityabrahmacārī (observing
celibacy throughout life) and his wife a disciple of
Maitreyī and well-versed in Advaitavedānta was a
Nit abrahmacāriṇī.
<div n="NI"/>Videha grew prosperous with agricultural wealth by
hard work put up by the peasants and divine wealth
by the virtuous deeds of the King and the people. Agri-

royal emblem itself was the figure of a plough. Rains
were there in season and in plenty because of the yāgas
conducted properly by the King. (Bālakāṇḍa, Kamba
Rāmāyaṇa).
