KUBERA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus: Brahmā—
Pulastya—Viśravas—Kubera.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Pulastya Prajāpati wedded Māninī alias Havir-
bhū, daughter of sage Tṛṇabindu, and a son called
Viśravas was born to them, Viśravas married Ilibilā
alias Daivavarṇinī, daughter of Bharadvāja. Rāvaṇa
Kumbhakarṇa and Vibhīṣaṇa were the sons of Viśravas
by another wife. (Refer to the genealogy of Rāvaṇa).
Viśravas was childless for long, and the above mention-
ed four sons were the fruits of the boon granted him
by Brahmā, whom he pleased by austerities. (For details
see under Viśravas, Para 1).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Kubera's attainment of eminence.%} Once during Kṛta-
yuga the Devas went to Varuṇa, and after performing
a Yajña for Kubera they told him thus: “In future you
live in the ocean itself as deva of all rivers, and let the
ocean and the rivers obey you. As in the case of the
moon you too will experience waxing and waning.”
From that day onwards Kubera became the lord of
[Page435-a+ 65]
oceans, rivers, streams etc. and all of them together
gave him immense wealth. Śiva became a particular
friend of Kubera. (Śalya Parva, Chapter 47).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Kubera in Laṅkā.%} Afterwards Kubera performed
penance for ten thousand years in water with head
submerged, to please Brahmā. Yet, Brahmā did not
appear. Then he performed penance standing on one
foot in the centre of Pañcāgni. Brahmā appeared and
asked him to choose any boon. Kubera requested that
he might be made a lokapālaka (protector of the uni-
verse) and the custodian of wealth, and Brahmā respon-
ded by supplying Kubera the treasures Śaṅkha nidhi
and Padmanidhi and also the Puṣpaka Vimāna as
vehicle. He was also appointed one of the Aṣṭadikpāla-
kas. (Indra, Agni, Yama, Nirṛti, Varuṇa, Vāyu,
Kubera and Īśa are the eight protectors of the eight
regions). Kubera's city is called Mahodaya.
<div n="NI"/>Kubera felt really happy and told his father Viśravas
about his new status and dignity. The father also
blessed the son. Kubera requested his father to get a
city built for him to live in, and his father asked him to
settle down in Laṅkā built by Maya on top of the
mountain Trikūṭa in the middle of the south sea. From
that day onwards Kubera took his abode in Laṅkā. (It
was originally built for Indra).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Old history of Laṅkā.%} Once upon a time when
Brahmā was repeating the Vedas he felt hungry. He was
annoyed that at that untimely hour he should have felt
hungry, and from his angry face emerged the Rākṣasa
called Heti. From his hunger emerged the Yakṣa called
Praheti. The Rākṣasa turned out to be an unrighteous
being, and the Yakṣa a righteous person. Heti married
Bhayā, daughter of Kāla, and a son Vidyutkeśa was born
to them, who wedded Sālakaṭaṅkā, daughter of Sandhyā.
To them were born a child, whom they forsook in
the valley of mountain Manthara and went their own.
way. Śiva and Pārvatī came that way just then, saw
the forsaken child and blessed it. At once the child
became a youth. Śiva named him Sukeśa, and he
married Devavatī, the daughter of a Gandharva called
Maṇimaya. To them were born three sons called
Mālyavān, Sumālī. and Mālī. Thanks to the blessings
of Śiva all of them became youths as soon as they were
born. By means of penances they secured from Brahmā
the boon to conquer the three worlds.
<div n="NI"/>They then returned to their father. They did not relish
the advice of their father to lead a righteous life. They
went round the three worlds harassing people. Maya
built for them the city called Laṅkā on the top of the
Mountain Trikūṭa.
<div n="NI"/>There is a story about the origin of Trikūṭa. Once a
controversy arose between Vāsuki and Vāyubhagavān
as to who was the greater of the two. To prove that he
was greater than Vāyu, Vāsuki enveloped with his body
mountain Mahāmeru so that Vāyu (wind) could not
enter it, and Vāyu tried to blow off the mountain with
the result that a dust storm concealed the whole world
from view. The Devas took refuge in Viṣṇu, who paci-
fied Vāsuki, and he then unwound one coil round the
mountain. Vāyu took advantage of the opportunity and
swept off one peak of the mountain to the South into
the sea, and that peak is Trikūṭa.
<div n="NI"/>Mālyavān, Sumālī and Mālī settled down in Laṅkā, and
they married Sundarī, Ketumatī and Vasudhā, the three
daughters of Narmadā, a Gandharva woman. Seven
[Page435-b+ 65]
sons called Vajramuṣṭi, Virūpākṣa, Durmukha, Supta-
ghna Yajñakośa, Matta and Unmatta and a daughter
called Nalā were born to Mālyavān and Sundarī. Ten
sons called Prahasta, Akampa, Vikaṭa, Kālakāmukha,
Dhūmrākṣa, Daṇḍa, Supārśva, Saṃhrāda, Prakvāta
and Bhāsakarṇa and four daughters called Vekā, Puṣ-
potkaṭā, Kaikasī and Kumbhīnasī were born to Sumālī
and Ketumatī. Four sons called Anala, Anila, Aha and
Sampāti (these four were the ministers of Vibhīṣaṇa)
were born to Mālī and Vasudhā.
<div n="NI"/>When the harassments of the Rākṣasas became unbear-
able the Devas sought protection from Śiva, and Indra
detailed to him about the unrighteous actions of Mālya-
vān, Sumālī and Mālī. Śiva directed the Devas to
Viṣṇu, who set out, to fight against the Rākṣasas.
Mālī cut at Garuḍa, and Viṣṇu killed him (Mālī)
with his Sudarśana Cakra. The other Rākṣasas retreated
to Laṅkā. As their presence in Laṅkā was dan-
gerous to the Devas, Viṣṇu directed the Sudarśana
Cakra to go to Laṅkā every day and kill the Rākṣasas
in groups. The Cakra began its work, and the remaining
Rākṣasas escaped to Pātāla. Laṅkā became thus deserted
and Kubera took his abode there. The Yakṣas, born from
the hunger of Brahmā roamed about without a leader
and ultimately settled down in Laṅkā under the leader-
ship of Kubera. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Kubera left Laṅkā.%} The other sons of Viśravas like
Rāvaṇa returned with boons from Brahmā for the con-
quest of the earth, and the first thing Rāvaṇa did was to
drive away his brother Kubera from Laṅkā. He also
took by force the Puṣpaka Vimāna of Kubera, who
cursed Rāvaṇa thus: “This will never be your vehicle,
but will become that of his, who kills you.”
<div n="NI"/>Kubera, with the Yakṣas, Kinnaras etc. went north and
settled on mount Gandhamādana. (Vana Parva, Chap-
ter 275).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Kubera's sabhā.%} The assembly hall of Kubera is 100
yojanas in length and 100 yojanas wide. High walls
surround the city. In the centre of the city is a beautiful
mansion studded with gems where Kubera sits surrounded
by thousands of women. Māruta Deva carrying fragrance
from Kalpavṛkṣa worships him. Gandharva and Apsarā
women entertain Kubera with music. Miśrakeśī, Ram-
bhā, Menakā, Urvaśī, Citrasenā, Śucismitā, Ghṛtācī,
Puñjikasthalā, Viśvācī, Sahajanyā, Pramlocā, Vargā,
Saurabheyī, Samīcī, Budbudā, and Latā are the chief
among them. Maṇibhadra (Māṇibhadra), Dhanada,
Āśveta, Bhadra, Guhyaka, Kaśeraka, Gaṇḍakaṇḍu,
Pradyota, Mahābala, Ka, Tumburu, Piśāca, Gajakarṇa,
Viśāla, Varāhakarṇa, Tāmroṣṭha, Halakakṣa, Halodaka
Haṃsacūḍa, Śaṅkhāvarta, Hemanetra, Vibhīṣaṇa,
Puṣpānana, Piṅgalaka, Śoṇitoda, Pravālaka, Vṛkṣabāṣ-
paniketa, Cīravāsas and Nalakūbara are the chief
members in the court of Kubera. Śiva, a good friend
of Kubera, very often visits him. Gandharvas and sages
like Viśvāvasu, Hāhā, Hūhū, Parvata, Tumburu and
Śailūṣa live in Kubera's assembly. Nārada told Dharma-
putra that the Kuberasabhā was thus always sweet and
pleasant. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 10).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Fight between Kubera and Rāvaṇa.%} Kubera got secret
information that the Devas and the brahmins had decid-
ed jointly to complain to Mahāviṣṇu about their
unbearable harassment by Rāvaṇa. He sent a messen-
ger to his brother Rāvaṇa warning him to lead a more
righteous life. Rāvaṇa got so much enraged at the
[Page436-a+ 64]
advice of his brother that he cut the messenger into
pieces and served as food to the Rākṣasas.
<div n="NI"/>Rāvaṇa mobilised his army against Kubera and the
Devas, and decided first to attack Kubera. At the head
of a huge army led by heroes like Mahodara, Prahasta,
Mārīca, Śuka, Sāraṇa, Vajradaṃṣṭra, Dhūmrākṣa,
Virūpākṣa, Yūpākṣa, Mahāpārśva, Matta, Unmatta,
Vikaṭa, Suptaghna, Yajñāntaka, Makarākṣa, Kumbha-
karṇa, Atikāya and Akṣakumāra, Rāvaṇa marched to
Alakāpurī where a fierce battle ensued between Rāva-
ṇa's and Kubera's armies. Many Yakṣas were killed
by Rāvaṇa's army, and the Yakṣa hero Maṇicara
killed a large number of Rākṣasas. As a last resort
Rāvaṇa thrashed Maṇicara on the head with a club
and this turned the hair on his head to one side. From
that day Maṇicara came to be known as Pārśvamauli
(head turned to one side). In the fight that followed
between Kubera and Rāvaṇa the former fell down
unconscious. But, the Yakṣas brought two Vimānas
and carried Kubera to the palace. Rāvaṇa plundered
Kubera's palace and carried off to Laṅkā a lot of costly
gems and other wealth. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa)
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Kubera became a Chameleon.%} King Marutta once per-
formed a Maheśvara yajña to which were invited
Indra, Varuṇa, Kubera and Kāla. While the yajña was
progressing Rāvaṇa came that way with his army.
Indra and the others, in great fear, ran away and
escaped disguised in various forms, Kubera assuming
the form of a chameleon. After resuming his own form
Kubera gave the Chameleon the gift to change its
colour. It was further blessed that to the onlookers it
would seem that there was gold on its cheeks. (Uttara
Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Kubera cursed Virūpākṣa.%} Kubera had a yakṣa called
Virūpākṣa as Manager, and he was in charge of
Kubera's treasures also. Virūpākṣa had employed a
gigantic yakṣa to look after the treasures outside the
capital. One day a brahmin called Pāśupata came in
search of treasures to Alakāpurī. He knew a very
peculiar art, viz. he would go about with a lamp
lighted with ‘the ghee of men’ (oily substance extracted
from human body) and the lamp would tumble down
from his hands on earth exactly on spots where trea-
sures lay hidden. Pāśupata tried to unearth Kubera's
treasures by the above means, and Virūpākṣa who got
scent of the brahmin's activities got him killed. Since a
brahmin (Pāśupata) was killed the sin of brahmahatyā
affected the Yakṣa community, and angered at this
Kubera cursed Virūpākṣa into a man, and he was born
on earth as the son of a brahmin. Virūpākṣa's wife
complained about this curse to Kubera, who told her
that she would be born as a daughter of the maid-
servant of the brahmin as whose son her husband was
born, and that he (son) would marry her. Kubera,
further told her that association with her would redeem
Virūpākṣa from the curse and that both of them would
return to him. Accordingly she lay as a human child at
the gates of a brahmin maid-servant, who took it to her
master. The child and the brahmin's son grew up
together in his father's house, and in due course they
were wedded to each other. They felt so happy as
though at a reunion after a long separation. First the
brahmin boy and after him his wife expired, and they
returned to Alakāpurī. (Kathāsaritsāgara)
[Page436-b+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Kubera and emperor Pṛthu.%} While emperor Pṛthu
was ruling the land in the best interests of his subjects,
mountains, trees, Devas, Asuras, Saptarṣis, Rākṣasas etc.
came to the earth and sang his praises, and as ordered by
the emperor the earth turned itself into a cow and they
milked her. It was Kubera who served as calf when
the Rākṣasas began to milk the cow. (Droṇa Parva,
Chapter 69, Verse 24).
<div n="NI"/>The Devas crowned Pṛthu as emperor, and, on that
occasion imperial symbols were presented to him. The
throne was presented by Kubera; the royal umbrella by
Varuṇa; the crown by Indra and the sceptre by Yama.
(Bhāgavata, 4th Skandha Chapter 15, Verses 14 and 15).
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Kubera cursed Tumburu.%} The Yakṣa called Tumburu
once displeased Kubera, who cursed him into a Rākṣasa.
He was to be redeemed from the curse on his death at
the hands of Śrī Rāma. Tumburu, who was born as
Virādha, the Rākṣasa in Daṇḍakāraṇya attacked Rāma
and Lakṣmaṇa during their stay in exile in the forest
and was killed by them. He was cremated in the forest.
He resumed his former form as Tumburu and returned
to Kubera's palace. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇya
Kāṇḍa, Canto 4).
<div n="NI"/>13) {%Kubera became Piṅgalākṣa.%} Kubera once looked with
jealousy at Pārvatī seated on the left thigh of Śiva, and
therefore, he became blind in one eye. When Pārvatī
regained her equanimity she turned that eye of Kubera
into yellow in colour so that he might always remember
the incident. Henceforth Kubera came to be known as
Ekapiṅgala.
<div n="NI"/>14) {%Agastya cursed Kubera.%} Kubera also was invited to
the chanting of mantras held by the Devas at Kuśāvatī.
Kubera was on his way to Kuśāvatī with Maṇimān
when the latter spat on the head of Agastya, who was
performing penance on the banks of river Kālindī.
Agastya cursed them thus:—“Oh Kubera, your attend-
ant Maṇimān has insulted me. Therefore, he himself and
the army will be killed by a man. You will grieve over
their death. But, you will be absolved from this curse at
the sight of the man, who had killed Maṇimān and his
army.”
<div n="NI"/>Bhīmasena, who went to mount Gandhamādana in
search of the Saugandhika flower could kill Maṇimān
and his soldiers because of this curse of Agastya. After
killing Maṇimān, Bhīma saw Kubera in person, and
the latter got absolved from the curse. (Vana Parva,
Chapter 161).
<div n="NI"/>15) {%Other information about Kubera.%} (i) He comforted
the Pāṇḍavas once during their life in exile in the forest.
(Vana Parva, Chapter 161, Verse 41).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) During the war with Rāvaṇa when Śrī Rāma
fainted on the field, it was the water, purified by
mantras, which Kubera sent through the Yakṣa,
Guhyaka, which brought Rāma back to consciousness.
<div n="NI"/>(Vana Parva, Chapter 289, Verse 9).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Kubera once cursed the Yakṣa called Sthūṇakarṇa.
He went to live in forest Ambā the woman became a
male by getting the penis of Sthūṇakarṇa. (See under
Ambā and Sthūṇakarṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Śukrācārya once gave Kubera a lot of wealth.
(Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 6, Verse 23).
<div n="NI"/>(v) A King called Mucukunda once fought with
Kubera. (Śānti Parva, Chapter 74, Verse 4). See under
Mucukunda.
[Page437-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(vi) Śukra once carried off all the wealth of Kubera,
who complained to Śiva about it. Śiva, in anger, raised
his śūla, when Śukra stood on its top and pressed it
down. Śiva threw Śukra off but he fell into the palms
of Śiva who threw him again. Śukra then entered the
stomach of Śiva and roamed about there finding no
path to get out. Śiva waited with the śula to kill Śukra
the moment he came out of his (Śiva's) stomach. Śukra
came out as Śiva's son, and Pārvatī prevented Śiva from
killing Śukra on the plea that it was not proper to kill
one's own son. Śukra thus escaped and Kubera lost
some of his wealth. (Śānti Parva, Chapter 289).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) On another occasion Kubera entertained sage
Aṣṭāvakra. (Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 19, Verse 37).
