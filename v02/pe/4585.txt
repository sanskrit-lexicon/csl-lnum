MṚTYU¦. The goddess of Death. Agni Purāṇa gives
details about the birth of Death. Hiṃsā was the wife
of Adharma. They got a son named Anṛta and a
daughter named Nikṛti. From them were born Bhaya,
[Page506-b+ 64]
Naraka, Māyā and Vedanā. Of these Māyā gave
birth to Mṛtyu, the destroyer of matter.
<div n="NI"/>Mṛtyu has been described both as a god and goddess
in Mahābhārata. The statements regarding Mṛtyu as
a deva are as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>(i) Three sons were born to Nikṛti, wife of Adharma.
One of them was Mṛtyu. Mṛtyudeva has neither wife
nor children because he is the destroyer of all. (Śloka
54, Chapter 66, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Once the son of an old Gautamī was bitten by a
snake. A hunter seeing it rushed to kill the serpent
but Gautamī objected to it. She advised him that it
was a sin to injure any living being. The serpent then
said, “It is not my fault that I bit the boy. I was
persuaded by the god of death to do so.” The god of
death Mṛtyudeva also appeared there then. He con-
firmed the snake's statement and added that God had
programmed all events beforehand and the boy's
death was not due to any mistake on anybody's part.
(Śloka 50, Chapter 1, Anuśāsana Parva)
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Once Mṛtyu followed the King Sudarśana, but
Mṛtyudeva had to withdraw after accepting defeat
because the King had been living a virtuous life of high
standard. (See under Sudarśana).
<div n="NI"/>The statements regarding Mṛtyu as a goddess are the
following:
<div n="NI"/>(1) This devatā was born from the body of Brahmā
in the shape of a woman. (Śloka 17, Chapter 53,
Droṇa Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Brahmā gave the work of destruction to Mṛtyu.
When she got that work she wept aloud. (Śloka 21.
Chapter 257, Śānti Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(3) The goddess of Mṛtyu once did severe penance.
(Śloka 17, Chapter 54, Droṇa Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(4) Brahmā assured the goddess of death that any
destruction by her would not be deemed as a sin.
(Śloka 44, Chapter 54, Droṇa Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(5) The terrible strength of Mṛtyudevatā is described
in Chapter 819, Śānti Parva, Mahābhārata.
