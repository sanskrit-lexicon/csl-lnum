ANṚTAṂ¦ (ASATYA). Hiṃsā, the wife of Adharma,
gave birth to daughters, Anṛta and Nikṛti, and from
them were born Bhaya, Naraka, Māyā and Vedanā.
And, Māyā begot Mṛtyu, the killer of all living beings.
From Vedanā was born sorrow. And from Mṛtyu were
born disease (vyādhi), Jarā (wrinkles), Śoka (grief),
Tṛṣṇā (desire) and Krodha (anger). (Agni Purāṇa,
Chapter 20).
