<div n="NI"/>2) {%How he got the name Dhundhumāra.%} The most
heroic exploit of Kuvalāśva or Kuvalayāśva was his
killing of the Asura Dhundhu.
<div n="NI"/>Madhu and Kaiṭabha were two Asuras born from the
ears of Mahāviṣṇu. The Asura Dhundhu was their
son. After his birth, Mahāviṣṇu killed Madhu and
Kaiṭabha. Dhundhu was furious over the death of his
fathers. He worshipped Brahmā who granted him
unconquerable strength. After defeating the gods he
went to the desert called Ujjālaka and lay beneath the
sands. Whenever he heaved a sigh clouds of dust rose
up to the sky and the earth shook for seven days. It
caused great damage to life and property in the world,
like a storm. Uttaṅka, a sage who lived in the
neighbourhood of Ujjālaka was the person who
suffered most from Dhundhu's misdeeds.
<div n="NI"/>Bṛhadaśva, of Ikṣvāku dynasty and father of Kuvalāśva
in his old age entrusted the rule of the country to his
son and prepared to go to the forest. At that time,
sage Uttaṅka came there and advised the King to go
to the forest only after killing Dhundhu. Bṛhadaśva
called his son Kuvalāśva and after giving him the task
of killing Dhundhu, proceeded to the forest.
<div n="NI"/>Kuvalāśva had 21,000 sons. Leading them, he went to
the desert Ujjālaka to kill Dhundhu. Uttaṅka declared
that anyone who killed Dhundhu would get part of
Mahāviṣṇu's strength. Kuvalāśva's sons surrounded
Dhundhu. The Asura awoke with anger. In the fire
from his eyes, all the 21,000 sons of Kuvalāśva were
burnt to ashes. Next Kuvalāśva came into conflict with
Dhundḥu. In that fight Dhundhu was killed. The gods
gave Kuvalāśva many boons. From that day, Kuvalā va
got the name, “Dhundhumāra” (one who killed
Dhundhu). (M.B. Vana Parva, 4 Chapters from 201).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%His sons.%} Kuvalāśva had three more sons named
Dṛḍhāśva, Kapilāśva and Candrāśva, or Bhadrāśva
besides the 21,000 sons. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter
204, Verse 40).
<div n="NI"/>4) Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 59 gives the following
account of how Kuvalāśva won the favour of sage
Gālava.
<div n="NI"/>Long ago while sage Gālava was performing tapas in
his āśrama, an Asura called Pātālaketu used to disturb
his meditations regularly. One day, the sage looked up
to Heaven and heaved a sigh. At once a horse dropped
down from the sky. A mysterious voice was heard
saying—“This mighty horse will travel thousands of
[Page653-b+ 65]
yojanas in a day.” The sage received that horse and
presented it to Ṛtadhvaja, King of the lunar dynasty.
Ṛtadhvaja mounted the horse and killed Pātālaketu.
<div n="NI"/>It was Viśvāvasu who dropped this horse from Heaven.
Pātālaketu had once fallen in love with Viśvāvasu's
daughter, Madālasā. It was in revenge that Viśvāvasu
had done like this.
