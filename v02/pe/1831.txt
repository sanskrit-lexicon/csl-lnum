DEVALA III¦. A disciple of Vyāsa. Asita, Devala, Vai-
śampāyana, Sumantu and Jaimini were some of the
disciples of Vyāsa. (M.B. Prathama Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>Brahmavaivarta Purāṇa contains the following story
about Devala. Devala was the son born to Asitamuni as
the result of a boon granted by Śiva. Raṃbhā, the
heavenly dancer fell in love with him. But, Devala did
not reciprocate her love. So, she cursed him to become
crooked in body. When he became crooked thus he
came to be called Aṣṭāvakra. For six thousand years he
did penance after which Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā appeared to
him. Rādhā laughed at the uncouth form of Aṣṭāvakra.
But, Kṛṣṇa admonished her and embraced him. At once
his bodily crookedness disappeared and he became very
handsome. A vimāna then descended from heaven,
and Rādhā, Kṛṣṇa and muni together disappeared in
it.
<div n="NI"/>Ekaparṇā, daughter of Himavān was this Devala's wife.
(Harivaṃśa, Chapter 18).
