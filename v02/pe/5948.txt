ŚAIVACĀPA¦. Śiva's bow. It was made by Viśvakarmā.
He made a Vaiṣṇavacāpa and a Śaivacāpa for the pur-
pose of a battle which was fought once between Viṣṇu
and Śiva. (See the 7th sub para, 7th para under the word
Viṣṇu).
<div n="NI"/>Long ago when Śiva set out to break up Dakṣayāga, he
was armed with this bow. After defeating the enemy
and breaking up the yāga, Śiva cooled down and pre-
sented the bow to his devotee, the king of Videha. The
king took the bow to his palace, kept it in his armoury
and used to offer due worship to it. His descendants
also continued to worship it. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa,
Bāla Kāṇḍa).
