LIKHITA I¦. An ancient sage. The King of that land
cut off his hands on a charge of theft. But they grew
into their original form by the power of the penance of
his brother, (Chapter 23, Śānti Parva).
<div n="NI"/>It was a time when the celebrated King Sudyumna was
ruling over the country. On the banks of the river
Bāhudā in that country there lived two sages, Śaṅkha
and Likhita, in two separate hermitages of their own.
Once Likhita went to the āśrama of his elder brother
Śaṅkha and finding none but feeling hungry took some
vegetables from there and started eating them. While
he was eating his brother walked in and he deemed
the action of his brother taking the vegetables without
his permission as an act of theft. Cutting the hands of
the culprit was the punishment accorded by the King
at that time to the offender. Śaṅkha sent Likhita to the
King. The King received the sage respectfully and gave
him a seat. The sage then told him all that had happen-
ed and then Sudyumna ordered the hands of Likhita to
be cut off. Blood was oozing from his hands when
Likhita went and bowed before his brother. The brother
congratulated him on his accepting the punishment for
his crime and asked Likhita to go and take a dip in the
Bāhudā river. Likhita bathed in that holy river and
then he found both the hands growing like lotus-buds
from his body. He rushed to his brother and showed
him the hands and then Śaṅkha said that it was due to
the power of his penance that Likhita got his hands.
Then Likhita asked his brother why he did not purify
him by his power before. Śaṅkha replied that the power
of punishing was vested in the King and the King

Sudyumna had become great by executing the law
correctly.
