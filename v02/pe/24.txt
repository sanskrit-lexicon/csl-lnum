ADHARMA¦. A description of the lineage of Adharma
is found in Agni Purāṇa. Hiṃsā (violence) is the
consort of Adharma. The couple procreated two
children, Anṛta and Nikṛti, and from them sprang
up Bhaya (fear), Naraka (Hell), Māyā (illusion),
Vedanā (pain) etc. And, out of them Māyā brought
forth Death, the destroyer of (all) objects. Vedanā, in
its turn produced Sorrow and Grief out of Raurava.
From Death were born Disease, Senility, Sorrow, Intense
desire and Anger. (Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 20).
