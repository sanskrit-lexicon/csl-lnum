MĀYĀVASIṢṬHA¦. There was once a King called Mitra-
saha among the Kings of the Solar dynasty who ruled
Ayodhyā. One day while he was hunting he saw two
demons roaming about as tigers and Mitrasaha killed
one of them. The other demon waited for an opportu-
nity to wreak vengeance and an opportunity presented
itself. Mitrasaha was conducting an Aśvamedha yāga to
which Vasiṣṭha was the chief priest. The demon went
to the King as Vasiṣṭha and privately told him that
he desired to eat meat and the King accordingly pre-
pared meat which was greatly resented by the real
Vasiṣṭha and the sage cursed Mitrasaha to become a
demon. The false Vasiṣṭha who played the trick on the
King is called Māyāvasiṣṭha. (See for details under
Kalmāṣapāda).
