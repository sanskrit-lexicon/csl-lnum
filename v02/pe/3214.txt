KĀMYAKAVANA¦. The Pāṇḍavas lived in this forest
for a long time, during their forest life. At that time,
several sages were performing penance in Kāmyakavana.
Vidura who went out in search of the Pāṇḍavas met
them in this forest. After that Sañjaya went to Kāmya-
kavana and took Vidura with him. It was in this
forest that the Pāṇḍavas met sages Mārkaṇḍeya and
Nārada. (M.B. Vana Parva).
