DASYU¦. The ancient dwellers of North India. What
we see in Ṛgveda is mostly a history of the Āryans from
the period of their exodus from the plateau Kumbha
till they reached the banks of the Yamunā. The plateau
of Kuṃbha is Kabul. The Dasyus were the first people
the Aryans had to confront with after passing the Indus.
Ṛgveda bears testimony to the fact that the civilization
of the Dasyus was far advanced than that of the Āryans.
Śaṃbara, King of the Dasyus, was the ruler of hundred
cities. All the cities were fortified with strong walls and
fortresses, which are described as ‘aśvamayī’, ‘āyasī’,
‘śatabhujī’ etc. The greatest enemies of the Āryans were
the ‘Paṇis’ of these cities. They were a particular class
of people of these cities. In the ‘Nirukta of Yāska’ it is
mentioned that paṇis were traders. Names of many of the
Kings of the Dasyus occur in the Ṛgveda. Dhuni,
Cumuri, Pipru, Varcas, Śaṃbara and such others are the
most valiant and mighty among them. The most impor-
tant of the several tribes of the Dasyus were the Śimyus,
the Kīkaṭas, Śigrus and the Yakṣus. They are mentioned
as the Anāsas in the Ṛgveda. (Anāsas—without nose).
Perhaps their nose was flat; more over they are stated as
having dark complexion. So it may be assumed that the
Dasyus were Dravidians. They talked a primitive
language, and they despised sacrificial religion. They did
not worship Gods like Indra and others. They possibly
worshipped the Phallus, Śiva, Devi and the like.
