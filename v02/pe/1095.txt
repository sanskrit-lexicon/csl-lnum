BHASMĀSURA¦. A demon. There is no mention about
this demon in any of the Sanskrit purāṇas but ‘Śivalī-
lāmṛta’ in Marāṭhi contains the following story about
him.
<div n="NI"/>Bhasmāsura was born of the Bhasma dust (ashes) on
the body of Śiva. Pleased at the great devotion of the
demon towards him Śiva asked him to name any boon
he wanted. Bhasmāsura said that he wanted the power
to burn to ashes anybody on whose head he placed his
hand. Bhasmāsura became arrogant with the boon
and he became a nightmare to the whole world. Then
Mahāviṣṇu appeared before him in the form of Mohinī,
an attractive dancer and alluring him by her charm
started on a dance called Muktanṛtya. During the course
of this dance Bhasmāsura was forced to place his hand
on his own head and the moment his head touched his
head he was burnt to ashes.
