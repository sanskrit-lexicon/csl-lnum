<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Viṣṇu are
Brahmā—Marīci—Kaśyapa—Sūrya—Tapatī.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Sūrya married Saṃjñā daughter of Viśva-
karmā. He begot of Saṃjñā two children named
Kālindī and Yama. At that time Sūrya (Sun) was not
of the form as seen now. Saṃjñā, unable to bear the
splendour of Sūrya who was of the shape of an egg
entrusted her maid Chāyā with the work of serving her
husband and left for a temple in the guise of a mare to
[Page786-a+ 63]
do penance. Chāyā disguised as Saṃjñā served Sūrya
for a very long period. Sūrya begot of her two child-
ren, Śanaiścara and Tapatī. Besides these, Sūrya had
another daughter named Sāvitrī also. (Chapter 47,
Bhaviṣya Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Marriage.%} There was a mighty king in the Lunar
race called Ṛkṣa in the beginning of Kṛtayuga. He
had a son named Saṃvaraṇa. He was made king of
his country by his father even while he was a boy.
He was a pious and righteous man. Vasiṣṭha was his
Guru and he taught Saṃvaraṇa the Vedas along with
the Aṅgas.
<div n="NI"/>Once Saṃvaraṇa entrusting the administration of the
state to Vasiṣṭha went to do penance in the forests. On
his way he followed a deer for a long distance on horse-
back and reached a deep forest named Vaibhrāja
alone. There he saw a lotus pond full of blossomed
lotuses and Kalhāra flowers. Celestial maidens were
playing there without interruption. Among them he
saw a very beautiful maiden. She was Tapatī daugh-
ter of Sūrya. Even at first sight they became lovers.
The king looking at her lost his balance and fell from
the horse. At once great and charming Gandharvas
approached the king and sprinkling water on his face
brought him back from swoon. Tapatī was also upset
and the other nymphs took her to her father's house
and consoled her.
<div n="NI"/>Saṃvaraṇa returned on horse-back to his residence
the city of Pratiṣṭhā. But the king neither slept nor ate
any food. The sage Vasiṣṭha knew that all the ail-
ments of the king were due to his love for Tapatī,
daughter of Sūrya. So he flew up by his yogic powers
and met Sūrya sitting in his chariot in all splendour.
The sage described to Sūrya the love affair between
Saṃvaraṇa and Tapatī and pleaded on behalf of the
king for giving Tapatī to Saṃvaraṇa. Sūrya was
pleased to hear that and sent Tapatī along with
Vasiṣṭha to Saṃvaraṇa. Before long the marriage of
Tapatī with Saṃvaraṇa was celebrated solemnly at
Pratiṣṭhānagara. The celebrated emperor Kuru was
the son born to Tapatī of Saṃvaraṇa. (Chapter 21,
Vāyu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>4). {%How she got that name.%} Because she was the
daughter of Sūrya who makes the sky hot (tapa) by
his brilliance, she was called Tapatī. (Śloka 6, Chapter
171, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>5). {%Tapatī becomes river Narmadā.%} Śūrya, father of
Tapatī, blessed her and said she would thereafter
flow west from the Vindhya as a river named Narmadā.
The present holy river Narmadā is but Tapatīdevī
transformed. (Chapter 47, Bhaviṣya Purāṇa).
