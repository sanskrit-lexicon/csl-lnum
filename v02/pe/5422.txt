PṚṢADHRA III¦. A brahmin boy. One night while he
was living in the āśrama of his Guru he saw a lion going
out from the premises of the āśrama with an āśrama
cow in its mouth. The brahmin boy rushed at it and
struck the lion with a sword. But due to want of proper
light the sword-cut fell on the cow and the cow fell
down dead. The next day the Guru finding the cow
lying dead mistook it for a deliberate killing by his
disciple and cursed Pṛṣadhra to death. to be born as
a Śūdra. When Pṛṣadhra was thus roaming about in
the forests in his cursed form he fell into a big forest
fire and was burnt to death. (Chapter 2, Sṛṣṭi Khaṇḍa,
Padma Purāṇa; Chapter 1, Aṃśa 4, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
