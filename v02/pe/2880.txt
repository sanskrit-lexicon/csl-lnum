JANTU¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} A King of the Pūru dynasty.
It is mentioned in Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 278, that he
was the son of the King Somaka and father of the King
Vṛṣatanu.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Jantu born again.%} Somaka had hundred wives. But
only one of them gave birth to a child. That child was
Jantu. He was a pet of all the hundred wives. Once
Jantu was bitten by an ant. All the hundred queens
began crying and shouting and all ran to him. Hearing
the tumult in the women's apartment of the palace,
the King and the minister ran to that place. When
the tumult was over the King began to think. “It is
better to have no sons at all, than to have only one
son. There are hundred queens. But none of them
bears a child. Is there a solution for this?”
<div n="NI"/>At last the King summoned his family-priests and
consulted them. The decision of the priests was that
if the King should sacrifice his only son, then all his
wives would become pregnant and all would give
birth to children, and that among the sons thus born,
Jantu also would be reborn. The mother of Jantu did
not look at this project with favour. “How can we be
sure that Jantu also will be there among the sons to be
born, after his death?” She was worried by this
thought. The priests consoled her and said that there
will be a golden mole on the left flank of Jantu.
Finally the mother agreed to their plan. Sacrificial
dais was arranged. Sacrificial fire for holy offerings was
prepared. The priests tore the child into pieces and
offered them as oblation in the fire. When the sacrifice
was finished, all the hundred queens became pregnant.
Each of them gave birth to a child. As the priests had
predicted, there was a golden mole on the left flank
of the child delivered by the mother of Jantu. (M.B.
Vana Parva, Chapters 127 and 128).
