KUŚADHVAJA III¦. A King. The following story about
him is quoted from the Skanda Purāṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Kuśadhvaja was a monkey in his former birth, and as he
had then performed the auspicious action of swinging
Śiva in a cradle throughout day and night, in the next
birth he was born as King Kuśadhvaja. One day the
King abducted the daughter of the Sage Agniveśa when
she was bathing. The Sage cursed the King into the
form of a vulture. He was promised redemption from
the curse that he would regain his human form on the
day on which he helped Indradyumna.
