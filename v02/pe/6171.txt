ŚAṄKARA II¦. A simpleton, who was killed by his
wife. This brahmin had a very mean wife called
Kalipriyā. After killing her husband she left the place
with her paramour. But, wild animals killed him on
their way in the forest. In all repentance Kalipriyā
returned home and after worshipping the corpse of her
husband she observed Kārttika vrata at the instance of
certain women. Thereby she got absolution from sin
and attained heaven. (Padma Purāṇa, Brahmakhaṇḍa,
Chapter 10).
