ŚĀNTI V¦. A maharṣi who was a disciple of the Ṛṣi called
Bhūti, who did once go to participate in a yajña con-
ducted by his brother Suvarccas, leaving matters con-
nected with his āśrama with Śānti, who discharged his
duties quite well in the absence of his master. One day
when agni became very scarce in the āśrama he praised
Agnideva, and noticing that the Deva was pleased
Śānti requested him to bestow a son on the maharṣi.
Accordingly a son was born to Bhūti, who later on be-
came famous as ‘Bhautyamanu.’ Bhūti, who was pleased
with the devout life of his disciple (Śānti) taught him
Sāṅgaveda. (Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa).
