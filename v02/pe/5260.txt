PRADYUMNA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} A son born to Śrī Kṛṣṇa of his
wife Rukmiṇī, Pradyumna was the rebirth of Kāma-
deva. (For genealogy see under Kṛṣṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} It was at the time when Kāmadeva and
Ratidevī were living together that Pārvatī, daughter of
Himavān, started her penance to get Śiva as her hus-
band. It was a need of the devas to get a son of Śiva to
kill the fierce demon Tārakāsura. The devas employed
Kāmadeva to create feelings of love in the ascetic Śiva
and make him marry Pārvatī. Taking instructions from
Indra, Kāmadeva took aim at Śiva with his bow and
arrow. Śiva was then in deep meditation and Kāma-
deva broke his concentration and Śiva got angry. He
opened his third eye and burnt Kāmadeva to death.
<div n="NI"/>Griefstricken by the death of her husband Ratidevī per-
formed penance near the Himālayas to propitiate
Mahādevī. Mahādevī appeared before her and consoled
her thus: “Little girl, Kāmadeva would be reborn as
the son of Śrī Kṛṣṇa of Rukmiṇī. He would then be
named Pradyumna. The devas have cursed Śambara
the leader of the asuras, during the battle between the
demons and the demi-gods that he (Śambara) would be
killed by Pradyumna. So Śambara is now searching
for the infant which is a rebirth of Kāmadeva. So you
abandon your present body and be born again as Māyā-
vatī to be the wife of Śambara. Pradyumna, the re-
born Kāmadeva, would kill Śambara and accept you as
his wife.” Devī disappeared after saying this.
<div n="NI"/>Obeying the instructions of Mahādevī, Rati abandoned
her life and was born in the world of asuras. She grew
up under the name Māyāvatī and became the wife
of Śambara.
<div n="NI"/>While Śrī Kṛṣṇa was living as the chief of Dvārakā his
first wife Rukmiṇī was yearning for a child. Kṛṣṇa was
deeply moved by the grief of Rukmiṇī and he flew on
the back of Garuḍa to Kailāsa to obtain a boon for the
birth of a child for her. On the way he alighted in the
āśrama of Naranārāyaṇas and after obtaining the bless-
ings of the sages there, went to Kailāsa and bowed
before Śiva and explained to him the purpose of his
visit. Śiva blessed him and said that Kāmadeva who
was burnt to death by the fire of his third eye would
take birth again as the son of Rukmiṇī. Kṛṣṇa returned
to Dvārakā well-pleased. Rukmiṇī became pregnant
and gave birth to Pradyumna, a rebirth of Kāmadeva.
The demon Śambara knew of this birth and coming to
Dvārakā in an invisible form carried away the infant
when it was seven days old.
<div n="NI"/>The demon threw the child into the ocean and a great
fish swallowed it. The fishermen of the country of
Śambara caught this fish and following the custom pre-
valent there presented the king with the fish. Śambara
called his wife Māyāvatī and asked her to take the fish
[Page594-b+ 64]
and get it cooked. When Māyāvatī cut open the fish for
cooking she found to her surprise a beautiful child in-
side it. Even from the first sight of the child Māyāvatī
had a great liking for it and so she took the child and
brought it up as her own child.
<div n="NI"/>When Pradyumna grew into a youth all the charm
and beauty of Kāmadeva were found in him. Māyāvatī
was excited to find a resemblance in him of her lost
husband Kāmadeva. One day the great sage Nārada
came that way and calling Māyāvatī to his side secretly
revealed to her that Pradyumna was the incarnation of
Kāmadeva and was thus her lost husband. From that
day onwards Māyāvatī's affection for him changed into
one of love. She taught him all the magic and witch-
craft of Śambara. When Pradyumna found that Māyā-
vatī's affection for him was gradually changing into one
of passionate love he questioned her about it. Māyāvatī
then told him everything that happened and Pra-
dyumna decided to kill Śambara and take Māyāvatī
away.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%War with Śambara.%} Pradyumna waited for an
opportunity to kill Śambara. One day Pradyumna went
under the flagstaff of Śambara which flew the royal flag
of the king with an emblem of the figure of a lion em-
bossed on it. He dropped it down by one stroke of his
arrow. Hearing of this Śambara ordered his sons to kill
Pradyumna. The eleven sons of Śambara, viz., Atisena,
Citrasena, Viṣvaksena, Śrutasena, Suṣeṇa, Somasena,
Ākkāla, Vikala, Kumbhaketu, Sudaṃṣṭra and Keśī,
attacked Pradyumna. The devas came in their vimānas
and joined sides with Pradyumna. The army of the
demons teased him with various kinds of weapons like
javelins, arrows, spears and battle axes. But Pra-
dyumna cut them all by his arrows and cut to pieces all
the sons of Śambara. Then Śambara sent an army
against him. They were also made to flee by the arrows
of Pradyumna. Then Śambara himself came on the
scene. The fight became horrible. The continuous flow
of arrows made it impossible for even Sun's rays to
reach the earth. Then Śambara started his magical war.
But Pradyumna faced that also. Śambara sent phantom
lions; but Pradyumna made them immobile. Śambara
then in turn created storms, rains, wild animals, ser-
pents and vultures. All of them were killed by Pradyu-
mna. Then with a well-aimed arrow Pradyumna killed
Śambara. Then he rushed to Dvārakā carrying Māyā-
vatī with him. The people of Dvārakā were astounded
to see them. Pradyumna went to Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Ruk-
miṇī and told them the whole story. They were over-
joyed to find them and blessed them.
