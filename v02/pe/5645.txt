RAMĀ¦. A synonym for Mahālakṣmī. There is a story
in the eighth Skandha of Devī Bhāgavata as to how the
name Ramā came to be attached to Lakṣmī.
<div n="NI"/>Revanta, the very handsome son of Sūrya one day came
to Vaikuṇṭha mounted on his horse Uccaiśśravas
to pay his respects to Mahāviṣṇu. Even Lakṣmīdevī
stood aghast speechless for a very short time at the
charm of Revanta changing her looks between him and
his horse. Mahāviṣṇu did not at all like this and cursed
that since Lakṣmī's eyes enjoyed the sight of some one
she would come to be called Ramā also and that she
would be born as a mare on earth.
