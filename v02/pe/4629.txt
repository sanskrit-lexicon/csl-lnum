MURA II¦. Son of Tālajaṅgha, an asura born of a part
of Brahmā. The capital of this valorous Murāsura was
in the city of Candravatī.
<div n="NI"/>Murāsura who possessed the brilliance of Brahmā was a
nightmare to the devas. Once Murāsura fought against
Viṣṇu and in the fierce fight that took place Viṣṇu was
defeated and he ran away from the battlefield and
started sleeping in a cave named Siṃhavatī in the neigh-
bourhood of Badarikāśrama. Mura went there too. Then
Mahāviṣṇu created a Devī through his Yogamāyā and
made her kill Mura.

Pleased at the slaughter of Mura, Viṣṇu blessed her and
said “From today onwards you will be known as ‘Ekā-
daśī’. You will be capable of wiping off all sins on
earth.” (Padmapurāṇa, Uttarakhaṇḍa 36. 50-80).
