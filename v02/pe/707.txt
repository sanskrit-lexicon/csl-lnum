ĀJAGARAVRATA¦. The vrata practised by the sage,
Ajagara. (A vrata is a predetermined course of action
which is followed with continued persistence). In his
own words it is the following: “If I get a grand feast
I will accept it but I will go without food for days
together if I do not get any food at all. People used to
feed me well sometimes, sometimes a little and some-
times not at all. I will eat vegetables and cakes some-
times. I will eat meat and any kind of food. I will lie on
soft bed or on bare earth sometimes and in big houses
if I get the chance. I will wear costly clothes if I get
them or I will wear dried leaves and animal skins. If
I get food from yāgaśālās I will never refuse it, but I
will never go seeking for it.” (Ślokas 19-25, Chapter
179, Śānti Parva, M.B.).
