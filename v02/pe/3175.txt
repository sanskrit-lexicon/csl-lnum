KALYĀṆA¦. A sage. Once certain Aṅgirases including
this sage observed sattra (sacrifice) for the attainment
of Heaven. But nobody was sure about the Devayāna
path which leads to Heaven. So they selected Kalyāṇa
to find out the path. He went in search of the
Devayāna path and on the way he met Ūrṇāyu, a
Gandharva who was in the company of some apsarā
women. The gandharva disclosed the Sāma which
would enable Kalyāṇa to find out the Devayāna path.
On his return, Kalyāṇa told the other Ṛṣis that he
had received the Sāma, but he refused to disclose from
whom he obtained it. With the help of that Sāma
known as Aurṇāyuva, the Aṅgirases attained Heaven,
but because of his failure to disclose the whole truth,
Kalyāṇa was denied access to Heaven. Besides that,
[Page378-b+ 64]
he became a victim to the disease of leprosy. (Pañca-
viṃśa Brāhmaṇam).
