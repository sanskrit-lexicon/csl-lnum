ŚAKTI III¦. The sound ‘Ś’ means welfare or prosperity
and ‘kti’ prowess. Therefore Śakti means she, who is
the embodiment of prosperity and prowess or she, who
grants prosperity and prowess. The definition of
‘Bhagavatī’ is, she who combines in herself knowledge
affluence, wealth, reputation, power and the female
organ. Therefore the word ‘Śakti’ may be taken to mean
Bhagavatī and Pārvatī, and what are termed as Bhaga-
vatī, Śakti, Devī, Ambikā, Pārvatī etc. are the mani-
festations of Śakti, Śiva's spouse. This Śakti exists
fractionally in all Devas. When, once upon a time the
devāsura war broke out the Śaktis of Devas like
Brahmā emerged to help Caṇḍikā. The vehicle, orna-
ments, weapon etc. of each Deva, his Devī also possessed.
The Śaktis (Devīs) of the Devas appeared in the follow-
ing manner. Brahmāṇī, wife of Brahmā, rode on the
swan wearing beads around her neck and holding the
water-vessel in her hands. She was followed by Vaiṣṇavī
Viṣṇu's Śakti on Garuḍa wearing yellow clothes and
with the conch, disc, lotus etc. in her hands. Śāṅkarī
Śiva's Śakti rode on the ox with the crescent moon and
serpents as ornaments and holding in her hands the
Śūla. ‘Kaumārī’, Subrahmaṇya's Śakti rode on
Airāvata with śūla in hands. The Śakti called ‘Vārāhī
in the form of a great boar rode carrying a corpse,
Nārasiṃhī’ Śakti took the form of narasiṃha (half man
and half lion). Yāmyā, Yama's śakti, rode on
buffalo holding in her hands a long stick. Śaktis
called Kauberī and Vāruṇī took their respective forms
and in this manner all the Śaktis came to the help
of Devī. This sight pleased not only the Devas, but
the mother of the universe also. Along with them in-
carnated on earth Śaṃkara, who gives ‘śaṃ’ (happiness)
to the world and blessed Caṇḍikā on the battle-field
(Devī Bhāgavata, 5th and 9th Skandhas).
