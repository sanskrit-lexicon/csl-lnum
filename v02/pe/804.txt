ĀTREYĪ IV¦. Daughter of Maharṣi Atri. She was married
to Aṅgiras, son of Agni. Aṅgiras always spoke rudely to
her and pained at this she once approached her father
and told him about this. Her father told her thus:
“Your husband is the son of Agni. That is why he
appears unbearable to you. Therefore give him a cold
bath always and he would gradually become mild.”
Hearing this the devout Ātreyī transformed herself into
a river and started to cool him down by constant
showers. This river later on became the famous Paruṣṇī
Nadī. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa).
