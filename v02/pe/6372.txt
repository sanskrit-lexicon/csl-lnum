ŚATADRŪ¦. The Purāṇic name of the Indian river now
called Sutlej. Grief-stricken over the death of his son,
Vasiṣṭha once jumped into this river, which, realising
that the maharṣi was as powerful as fire, divided itself
into many branches and flowed in various directions,
and hence the river came to be known as Śatadrū.
(Ādi Parva, Chapter 176, Verse 8). Once in talking
about sublime rivers to Śiva, Pārvatī mentioned this
river also. (Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 146, Verse 18).
Śatadrū is also one of the ten rivers referred to in the
Ṛgveda.
