GHANAPĀṬHA¦. A particular system of Vedic studies.
There are four such systems. The system of separating
each word from conjunctions and combinations and
combining with the word just before and after it is
called Jaṭāpāṭha. Jaṭāpāṭha means joined or combined
Pāṭha. Ghanapāṭha is there to avoid errors in Jaṭāpāṭha
Ghanapāṭha consists of padapāṭha and Kramapāṭha.
In Padapāṭha the split words are once more combined
and Prātiśākhya lays down the rules to combine words.
It is because of this scientific system of reciting that
the Ṛgveda remains to this day pure in text without
different readings.
