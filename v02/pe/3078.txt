KĀKṢĪVATASUTĀ¦. A female sage named Ghoṣā who
was the daughter of the sage Kākṣīvān. As she was
suffering from the disease of leprosy, no one was pre-
pared to marry her. She composed a mantra in praise
of the Aśvinīdevas. They cured her of her disease.
After that she got married. Besides Ghoṣā, Kākṣīvān
had another daughter named Bhadrā. (See under
