<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth and genealogy.%} Mahābhārata mentions as
follows about the birth of this giant:—Viśravas was
born from Pulastya the son of Brahmā. Kubera was
born from Viśravas. Kubera ruled over Laṅkā. Viśravas
who had no one to help him once looked with anger at
Kubera, who, understanding the wish of his father gave
him three giantesses named Puṣpotkaṭā, Rākā and
Mālinī as attendants. They attended on him faithfully
and Viśravas was pleased with them. To Viśravas two
sons named Rāvaṇa and Kumbhakarṇa were born by
Puṣpotkaṭā, Vibhīṣaṇa was born by Mālinī and the
twin sister and brother Śūrpaṇakhā and Khara were
born by Rākā. By and by Khara became a famous
archer. Rāvaṇa, Kumbhakarṇa and Vibhīṣaṇa perform-
ed penance to obtain boons and Khara and Śūrpa-
ṇakhā stayed with them to serve them. (M.B. Vana
Parva, Chapter 275).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Other brothers.%} Khara had two other brothers
Dūṣaṇa and Triśiras. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The slaughter of Khara.%} While Śrī Rāma, Sītā and
Lakṣmaṇa were staying in the forest of Daṇḍakāraṇya
Śūrpaṇakhā the sister of Khara came there once and
tried to get one of the brothers Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa
as her husband. Lakṣmaṇa cut off her nose and ears.

She went to Khara, Dūṣaṇa and Triśiras and lamented
before them. The three of them immediately started
with an army of fourteen thousand giants and fought
with Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, who killed every one of
them. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇyakāṇḍa, Sargas 19
to 30).
