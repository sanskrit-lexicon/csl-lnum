ANDHATĀMISRA¦. One of the 28 hells. (See Naraka).
This hell is destined for wives who cheat their husbands
and consume food and for husbands who cheat their
wives and eat food. Agents of Yama get hold of
such sinners and push them into the Andhatāmisra. As
the cords of the agents with which they bind the sin-
ners get tighter around their bodies they faint and fall
down owing to unbearable pain. When they regain
consciousness and try to run away and escape, the
Agents of Yama again bind them with the cord. (Devī
Bhāgavata, Aṣṭama Skandha).
