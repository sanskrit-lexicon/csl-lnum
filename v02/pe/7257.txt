ŚŪRPAṆAKHĀ¦. Rāvaṇa's sister.
<div n="NI"/>1) Viśravas, son of Brahmā and Kaikasī daughter
of Sumālī lived in the forest called Sleṣmātaka.
Once Kaikasī had a sexual union with Viśravas at an
untimely hour. As a result of this union, Kaikasī
gave birth to four children at intervals of one Yāma
each. These children were, Rāvaṇa, Kumbhakarṇa,
Vibhīṣaṇa and Śūrpaṇakhā. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla
Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Domestic Life.%} Śūrpaṇakhā was married to the
Rākṣasa, Vidyujjihva. The son who was born to the
couple was named Śambhukumāra.
<div n="NI"/>The Kālakeyas were the brothers of Vidyujjihva. At
the time of Rāvaṇa's return after his triumphal march,
a battle took place between him and the Kālakeyas.
The Kālakeyas fell under the sword of Rāvaṇa. Enraged
at the death of his brothers, Vidyujjihva encountered
Rāvaṇa. In the battle that followed, Vidyujjihva was
killed. On hearing about her husband's death, Śūrpa-
ṇakhā went to Rāvaṇa wailing and lamenting. Moved
to pity at the sight of her tears, Rāvaṇa said:- “Dear
Sister! You may travel through the three worlds and
accept any man you like as your husband. Is there any
one who would not wish to become my relative? Go
and marry a husband suited to you. If any one turns
down your proposal, just inform me. I shall come and
make him your husband.”
<div n="NI"/>Śūrpaṇakhā was pleased. She at once started going
[Page769-b+ 64]
round the three worlds with Khara, Dūṣaṇa and Triśiras.
(Uttara Rāmāyaṇa; Kambarāmāyaṇa, Araṇya Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Before Lakṣmaṇa.%} Śūrpaṇakhā's son, Śambhukumāra
was performing tapas to Śiva in Daṇḍakāraṇya. It was
at this time that Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa arrived in the
forest, accompanied by Sītā. They reached the place
called Pañcavaṭī in Daṇḍakāraṇya. Śrī Rāma wished
to set up his hermitage in the middle of the five “vaṭa”
trees in Pañcavaṭī.
<div n="NI"/>At the very sight of Sītā, Śambhukumāra fell in love
with her. He stood there in the form of a tree. While
building the hermitage, Lakṣmana felled that tree and
thus Śambhukumāra was killed. (See under Śambhu-
kumāra).
<div n="NI"/>The widowed Śūrpaṇakhā, in her search for a suitable
husband happened to reach and settle down at the
southern border of Daṇḍakāraṇya. She had failed in
her search so far.
<div n="NI"/>It was at this stage that she came to know of Śrī Rāma
and his party. She disguised herself as Lalitā and
entered Śrī Rāma's āsrama. The sight of Śrī Rāma
made her a victim to carnal passion. She submitted
her desire to him, but he turned down her prayer. The
disappointed Śūrpaṇakhā left the āśrama at once. But
she appeared again in front of Sītā. Feeling that so long
as Sītā was alive, Śrī Rāma would not be prepared to
court her, Śūrpaṇakhā rushed furiously at Sītā.
<div n="NI"/>Lakṣmaṇa who was watching the whole scene, suddenly
rushed to the spot and pushed her out of the āśrama.
He cut off her ears, nose and breasts.
<div n="NI"/>Śūrpaṇakhā, bleeding profusely from her mutilation,
hastened to her brother Rāvaṇa to inform him of the
calamity. In obedience to Rāvaṇa's command, Khara,
Dūṣaṇa and others who came and encountered
Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, were also slain in the battle.
(Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇya Kāṇḍa).
