DĀLBHYA¦ (BAKADĀLBHYA). A Maharṣi of Naimi-
śāraṇya. In Vāmana Purāṇa, there is a story of how this
sage once performed a homa and burnt Dhṛtarāṣṭra's
kingdom in the sacrificial fire.
<div n="NI"/>Long ago some of the sages of Naimiśāraṇya approached
Dhṛtarāṣṭra with a request for some money. Their
leader was the sage Dālbhya (Baka). It was he who
begged Dhṛtarāṣṭra for money. The king not only
refused to give money, but also insulted the sage. Pro-
voked at this, Dālbhya began performing a homa in
[Page195-b+ 65]
which Dhṛtarāṣṭra's kingdom was the havis in the form
of sliced meat. This homa was performed in Avakīrṇa-
mahātīrtha at Pṛthūdaka. As a result of it the kingdom
began to decline. The King was alarmed and consulted
great scholars and astrologers about the cause of the
country's decline. They told him that the cause of the
disaster was Dālbhya's homa. Dhṛtarāṣṭra at once pro-
ceeded with rich presents to propitiate Dālbhya at
Avakīrṇamahātīrtha. Dālbhya was pleased and as
desired by the King, performed homa with milk and
honey and revived all those who had died. (Vāmana
Purāṇa, Chapter 39).
<div n="NI"/>Mahābhārata, Sabhā Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 11 says
that this Mahaṛṣi flourished in Yudhiṣṭhira's assembly.
On another occasion, he is referred to, as coming to
Dyumatsena, the father of Satyavān. At that time, he
comforted Dyumatsena by saying that Satyavān would be
blessed with longevity. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter
298, Verse 17).
