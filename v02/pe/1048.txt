BHARADVĀJA I¦. Another name of Dīrghatamas.
<F>**) Dīrghatamas is also called Bharadvāja. But the Bharadvāja of purāṇic fame is not Dīrghatamas. Dīrghatamas is the son whom
Bṛhaspati illegitimately got of Mamatā, his brother's wife. There was then another legitimate child in the womb of Mamatā. Knowing this
the devas told her ‘Bharadvāja’ meaning ‘bear the brunt of two’ and so the son of Bṛhaspati got the name of Bharadvāja also. The real
name of this son was Dīrghatamas or Vitatha. Dīrghatamas is not the Bharadvāja who was the father of Droṇa. The famous Bharadvāja
was the son of Atri. Dīrghatamas or Vitatha was the adopted son of Bharata, son of Duṣyanta. (Bhāgavata and Kamparāmāyaṇa. For
details see under Bharata I and Dīrghatamas.</F>
