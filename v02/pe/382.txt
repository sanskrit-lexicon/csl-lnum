APĀLĀ¦. A daughter of the great sage, Atri. Suffering
from leprosy and hence forsaken by her husband Apālā
stayed with her father and started tapas to please
Indra. One day, on her way home from the river,
Apālā tasted the Soma which was meant to be offered
to Indra and hearing the sound produced then
Devendra appeared before Apālā. She gave the Soma
to Indra, who was so pleased with her that he cured
her of her leprosy. (Ṛgveda, 8-91).
