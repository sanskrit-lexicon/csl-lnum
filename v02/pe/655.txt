AVIKṢIT I¦. A famous King. The son of Karandhama
and father of Marutta. He was honoured even by
Bṛhaspati, having performed a hundred horse sacrifices.
Mention is made in the Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa that Avikṣit
had seven wives: Varā, Gaurī, Subhadrā, Līlāvatī,
Vibhā, Maṅgavatī, and Kumudvatī. Besides them Vai-
śālinī the princess of Viśālā also was his wife. He had
taken this Vaiśālinī from her Svayaṃvara dais (the
bride herself selecting a husband from those who are
present), defeating the Kings who were present
there. Those defeated Kings, later, joined together and
defeated Avikṣit and took him a prisoner. Finally Kara-
ndhama rescued him. His greatness is described as
follows:
<div n="NI"/>“The righteous man Avikṣit is equal to Indra in pro-
wess. This austere and righteous man has become a
great sacrificer. In brightness he is equal to the
Sun, as forgiving as the earth, in intelligence equal
to Bṛhaspati and as firm as the Himālayas. By his
thought, word, and deed and self control and noble
actions he kept his subjects in peace and prosperity.”
(Bhāṣā Bhārata, Aśvamedha Parva, Chapter 4, Stanzas
19-21).
