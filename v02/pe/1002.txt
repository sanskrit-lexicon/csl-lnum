BHAGAVAD¦ GĪTĀ.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} The Bhagavad Gītā is a poem consisting of
650 verses divided into eighteen chapters. The Gītā
covers chapters 25-45 in the Bhīṣma Parva of the Mahā-
bhārata, and it is in the form of a talk or discussion
between Arjuna and Lord Kṛṣṇa. The mighty armies
of the Pāṇḍavas and the Kauravas were arrayed on
opposite sides for mortal combat on the field of Kuru-
kṣetra when Arjuna, overcome by grief at the prospect
of fathers, brothers, preceptors and other Kinsmen
fighting and killing one another expressed to his
charioteer, Śrī Kṛṣṇa his aversion to fighting. But, the
Lord pointed out to the unwilling Arjuna, by unique
and various arguments, his imperative duty, under the
circumstance, to fight and fight in heroic earnestness with
the result that Arjuna shed his disinclination to fight and
entered the fray, which ended in the ultimate victory
of the Pāṇḍavas. And the dialogue between Arjuna
and Kṛṣṇa, and especially the great teaching of Kṛṣṇa
on the field form the theme of the Gītā. The Gītā
contains three spheres or fields of teaching; the karma
yoga (philosophy of action), jñāna yoga (philosophy of
knowledge) and Bhaktiyoga (philosophy of devotion).
The three yogas are treated each in six chapters.
<div n="NI"/>The theme of the Gītā is philosophy, and it is revered
as one of the most sublime philosophical texts of the
Hindu religion. Many a great thinker and philosopher
like Ācārya Śaṅkara, Rāmānujācārya and Madhvā-
cārya have annotated, and written commentaries on
the Gītā. There is a school of thought which believes
that the Gītā was taught to Arjuna by Kṛṣṇa himself
on the battle-field in something like tabloid form and
that Vyāsa elaborated the mighty teaching in its present
form. The poet, Bāṇa, who flourished in the 7th
century A.D., and the great Śaṅkara, who lived in the
8th century believed that the Gītā was sung by Kṛṣṇa
himself. But there are some modern thinkers, who
argue that the Gītā was composed some time between
the third and fourth centuries B.C. and it was inter-
polated into the Mahābhārata in the second century
A.D.
<div n="NI"/>The Gītā has translations in all the languages of the
world. The whole world has acclaimed it as a very

philosophy.
