ARIṢṬANEMI I¦. One of the six sons of Vinatā.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Viṣṇu, Brahmā, Kaśyapa and Ariṣṭanemi.
Kaśyapa married Dhṛtarāṣṭrī, daughter of Dakṣa. Śukī
was their daughter, Śukī had a daughter Natā and
she a daughter, Vinatā. Ariṣṭanemi, Tārkṣya, Aruṇa,
Garuḍa, Para, Āruṇi and Śrī Vāruṇi were the children
of Vinatā. (M.B., Ādi Parva, Chapter 65, Verse 40).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Tapaśśakti of Ariṣṭanemi.%} Ariṣṭanemi with his son
was once performing tapas in the forest. The son was
immersed in meditation clad in the skin of a deer thus
looking like a deer. Parapurañjaya, the King of Hehaya
who happened at the time to be hunting in the forest
discharged his arrow against the son of Ariṣṭanemi taking
him for a deer. When the king found out the real fact
he felt extremely sorry, and he craved pardon of the
boy's father for unwittingly killing his son. Then Ariṣṭa-
nemi pointing out his son who was standing alive
asked the King, “Is this the boy whom you killed?”
The King was naturally wonder-struck. But Ariṣṭa-
nemi told the King that there was nothing to wonder
at in the case as nobody would be able to kill them be-
cause their Tapaśśakti was so great. The King felt so
happy at this, and returned to his palace after prostrat-
ing at the feet of the sage. (M.B., Araṇya Parva,
Chapter 184).
