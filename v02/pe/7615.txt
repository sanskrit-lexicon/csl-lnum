TṚṆĀVARTA¦. A demon who was the son of Tārakā-
sura. This demon was living serving Kaṃsa. Kaṃsa
once sent Tṛṇāvarta to kill Kṛṣṇa growing up in
Ambāḍi. Tṛṇāvarta, in magic disguise went to the
[Page797-a+ 65]
house of Nandagopa. Even when he entered the place
bad omens were visible. Yaśodā was breast-feeding
baby Kṛṣṇa keeping the babe in her lap. Soon Yaśodā
felt the babe gaining weight and very soon she felt the
weight unbearable and rose up to place the child on a
mat on the ground. But even before that Yaśodā was
fixed to the ground by the weight of the babe. But
somehow she placed the babe on a mat on the ground
and went out to wash her hands and face. When she
came back she could not find the babe on the mat.
Tṛṇāvarta had come in the form of whirl-wind and had
already carried away the child. But after some time the
weight of the babe increased so much that Tṛṇāvarta,
unable to carry the weight, wanted to drop the child to
the ground. But the child stuck on to his neck and
breast tightly and Tṛṇāvarta finding no escape from
the tight hold which suffocated him, fell to the ground
dead on a hard rock. (10th Skandha, Bhāgavata).
