TRIŚIRAS I¦. A demon who was a friend of Rāvaṇa. The
Khara-Dūṣaṇa-Triśiras combination led the attack on
Śrī Rāma in the forest of Daṇḍaka when Lakṣmaṇa cut
off the nose and breasts of the demoness Śūrpaṇakhā.
Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa killed all the three. Triśiras was
a powerful fighter and Śrī Rāma's forehead was wounded
by an arrow from Triśiras. The latter came and fought
in a chariot drawn by four horses. He was killed by an
arrow from Rāma. (Sarga 26, Araṇya Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki
Rāmāyaṇa).
