PŪṢĀ¦ I (PŪṢAN). Pūṣā attended the Janmotsava of
Arjuna. (Chapter 122, Ādi Parva). When Arjuna and
Kṛṣṇa fought against Indra at Khāṇḍavaprastha Pūṣā
stood as an ally of Indra. (Śloka 35, Chapter 226, Ādi
Parva). Once all the devas together performed a yāga
and not knowing the importance of Śiva, they did not
invite him to the Yāga. Śiva attended the function
uninvited. The devas did not like it and they attacked
Śiva. The twelve ādityas as a team fought against Śiva
and in the fight Pūṣā lost his teeth. (Chapter 18,
Sauptika Parva). Once Pūṣā presented to Subrahmaṇya
two warriors named Pāṇītaka and Kālika.
