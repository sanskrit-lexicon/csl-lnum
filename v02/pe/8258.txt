VIDULĀ¦. A heroic Kṣatriya woman of India. In Mahā-
bhārata, Udyoga Parva, there is a story, how this
Vidulā sent her son, who had fled from the battle-field
because of fear, back to the battlefield again.
<div n="NI"/>The Pāṇḍavas, who had completed forest-life and
Pseudonymity successfully and returned to Hastināpura
were again deceived and put to shame. Śrī Kṛṣṇa's
argument as a mediator was not successful, in the
[Page848-a+ 65]
palace of the Kauravas. Śrī Kṛṣṇa came away from
the palace of Duryodhana and entered the house of
Vidura and visited Kuntī. Śrī Kṛṣṇa asked her opinion
on the idea of waging a war against the Kauravas. It
is not meet and right on the part of a heroic mother to
welcome a son who comes home being defeated in
battle. To substantiate this point, she told Śrī Kṛṣṇa
the story of Vidulā, as given below.
<div n="NI"/>Vidulā was a brave woman, who lived in ancient India.
Her son Sañjaya fought with the King of Sindhu and
was defeated. When he came home Vidulā did not
receive him. She emboldened him by saying that she
would be more proud of a son, who had sacrificed his
life, in the battlefield than one who returned home
defeated. All his arguments which were excuses for his
cowardice, were refuted by his mother. At last Sañjaya
engaged again in a battle with the King of Sindhu.
<div n="NI"/>On hearing this story told by Kuntī Śrī Kṛṣṇa became
immensely pleased. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, 3 Chapters
from 134).
