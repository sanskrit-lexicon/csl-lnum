KĀLABHĪTI¦. A devotee of Śiva. As his father Māṃṭi
performed penance for the sake of a son for a thousand
years his wife conceived, but did not deliver. Māṃṭi
asked the child in his mother's womb why he did not
come out to which the latter replied that he did not
come out as he feared the Asura called Kālamārga. (As
the child feared Kālamārga it came to be called
Kālabhīti). As advised by Śiva, Māṃṭi created in the
child knowledge about dharma, renunciation etc. and
thus made him conscious about higher knowledge. The
child came out of the mother's womb. In due course of
time Kālabhīti took to the worship of Śiva, who blessed
him as follows: “Since you have outlived Kālamārga,
in future you will become famous as Mahākāla.”
(Skanda Purāṇa).
