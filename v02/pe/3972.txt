LAṄKĀLAKṢMĪ¦. A Devī who was relieved of her curse
by a hard stroke of his hand by Hanūmān.
<div n="NI"/>1). {%How she came to Laṅkā.%} Laṅkālakṣmī was Vijaya-
lakṣmī in her previous birth. She was the watch-girl of
the treasury of Brahmā and one day finding her negli-
gent of her duties Brahmā cursed her “Go to the earth
and be the watch-girl of the palace-gate tower of
Rāvaṇa”. She begged for relief and Brahmā said, “Dur-
ing the incarnation of Viṣṇu as Rāma his wife Sītā will
be carried away by Rāvaṇa and Hanūmān will come in
search of her to Laṅkā. You will then block the way of
that mightly monkey and he will then strike you down
by a fierce blow of his hand. You will be then released
from the curse and come back to me.”
[Page451-b+ 64]
Vijayalakṣmī accordingly was born in Laṅkā and
became the watch-girl of Rāvaṇa's palace.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Release from the curse.%} Hanūmān coming to Laṅkā
in search of Sītā tried to find an opening through
which to enter Laṅkā. Then he saw a huge tower-gate
on the northern side of the mountain Suvelagiri.
When he reached the gate he found it closed. The
mighty monkey beat hard on the door and the strong
door burst into two and fell on to the floor. Instantly a
ferocious woman of enormous size rushed to the gate
with a piercing roar and blocked it. Hanūmān found
the situation dangerous and so gave her a powerful
blow and felled her. She then very politely asked
Hanūmān who he was and Hanūmān revealed his
identity and told her the purpose of his visit. Lankā-
lakṣmī then took leave of Hanūmān and leaving
Laṅkā went to Śrī Rāma and worshipped him. Rāma
blessed her and she returned to Satyaloka and started
doing her duties as before. (Sundara Kāṇḍa, Kamba
Rāmāyaṇa).
