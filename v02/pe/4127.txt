MAHĀMERU¦. The golden coloured peak of Himavān.
The seat of Lord Śiva, according to the Purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General features.%} Mahāmeru surpasses even the sun
in its dazzling golden brilliance. Devas and Gandharvas
attend on it on all sides. It is inaccessible to sinners.
There are celestial herbs and serpents at its base. It is
Mahāmeru that keeps Heaven in its place by supporting
it. The atmosphere there, is always alive with the
sweet songs of various kinds of birds. Precious stones
are scattered all over its surface. All the 33 crores of
gods dwell on the sides of this Mountain. (M.B. Ādi
Parva, Chapter 17).
<div n="NI"/>Saptarṣis like Vasiṣṭha rise and fall on Mahāmeru.
Mahā Viṣṇu and Brahmā have their places in Mahā-
meru. Viṣṇu's place is in the east. There is a special
place there for the residence of Maharṣis. Those who
go to Mahāmeru never return. The Sun and Moon go
round. Mahāmeru everyday. (M.B. Vana Parva,
Chapter 163).
<div n="NI"/>There are twenty mountains surrounding Mahāmeru.
On the eastern side there are two mountains, Jāra and
Devakūṭa. On the western side there are two mountains,
Pavamāna and Pāriyātra. On the southern side are the
two mountains, Kailāsa and Karavīra and on the north-
ern side, the two mountains, Triśṛṅga and Makaragiri.
Thus Mahāmeru shines like the sun in the midst of
eight mountains. In the middle of Mahāmeru is situat-
ed Brahmaloka, the abode of Brahmā in a square
extending over 10,000 yojanas. This region is of inex-
pressible splendour. At eight places around this
Brahmapurī, are situated the eight posts or abodes of
the Aṣṭadikpālas, each of the abodes being 25000
yojanas in extent. Thus there are nine Purīs or Cities
[Page463-a+ 65]
on the top of Mahāmeru. They are:— (1) Brahmā's
Manovatī in the centre. (2) Due east of it, Indra's
Amarāvatī. (3) In the south-east corner, Agni's
Tejovatī. (4) On the southern side, Yama's Saṃyamanī.
(5) In the south west corner, Nirrti's Kṛṣṇāñjana,
(6) On the western side, Varuṇa's Śraddhāvatī. (7)
In the north-west corner, Vāyu's Gandhavatī. (8) On
the northern side, Kubera's Mahodaya. (9) In the north
cast corner, Īśān'as Yaśovatī. (Devī Bhāgavata,
8th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Mahāmeru and Laṅkā.%} Rāvaṇa's place of abode Laṅkā
was really a peak of Mahāmeru. (For further details, see
the previous history of Laṅkā in Para 5 under the word
Kubera).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%How Mahāmeru got its golden colour.%} The Purāṇas
declare that the sun keeps going round Mahāmeru.
Once, while the sun was thus going round, he
wished to take a little rest. He asked permission to
place the axle of his chariot for a short while on Mahā-
meru. The mountain agreed to it. The grateful Sun-
god (Sūrya) blessed Mahāmeru that it would thence-
forth have golden colour. Until it received this blessing,
Mahāmeru had the colour of ordinary mountains.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other details.%}
