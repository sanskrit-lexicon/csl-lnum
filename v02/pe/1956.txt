DHARMAŚARMĀ I¦. A brahmin who was born a parrot
named Kañjala in his rebirth. Dharmaśarmā was one of
[Page231-b+ 65]
the three sons of an eminent Brahmin called Vidyādhara.
His other two sons were Vasuśarmā and Nāmaśarmā.
While both his brothers became great scholars Dhar-
maśarmā never studied anything and became a muff.
His father was greatly worried on account of this.
Dharmaśarmā never heeded the advice of his father
and went about in bad company ruining himself. Years
went by and Dharmaśarmā became old.
<div n="NI"/>One day Dharmaśarmā was sitting repentant in a
temple sadly pondering over his past when a siddha
came to the temple. Watching him Dharmaśarmā saw
him go and sit in a lonely place for meditation with his
eyes shut. Dharmaśarmā went and stood near him
very respectfully. When the Siddha opened his eyes
after some time he saw Dharmaśarmā standing before
him and then the Siddha made enquiries about Dhar-
maśarmā. The latter then requested the Siddha to give
him instructions to acquire the supreme knowledge.
The Siddha then gave him Jñānopadeśa (advice on
knowledge) and Dharmaśarmā soon became a Siddha
himself. He then started on a pilgrimage and on the
way he got a parrot. He took care of the bird just like
his son and loved it very affectionately. One day when
Dharmaśarmā was away from the place to collect
fruits for his food a cat caught and ate the parrot.
Greatly grief-stricken Dharmaśarmā wept bitterly and
ran about like a mad man. After some days he died
and because at the time of death he was thinking about
the parrot he was born a parrot in his next birth. The
jñānopadeśa of the siddha was still lingering in him
while he died and so even in his life as a parrot the never
lost the jñāna he had acquired in his previous life.
(Chapter 122, Padma Purāṇa).
