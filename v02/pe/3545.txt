KIṄKARA I¦. A Rākṣasa. Śakti, the son of Vasiṣṭha
and King Kalmāṣapāda of the solar dynasty once
quarrelled with each other, and the King cursed and
turned Śakti into a Rākṣasa. At this juncture Viśvā-
mitra invoked Kiṅkara, a Rākṣasa attendant of his,
into the body of Kalmāṣapāda, and induced by
Kiṅkara, Kalmāṣapāda killed all the sons of Vasiṣṭha.
(Ādi Parva, Chapter 175).
