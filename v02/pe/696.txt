ĀGNEYĀSTRA¦. A powerful weapon or missile. One
night Arjuna fought against a gandharva, Aṅgāraparṇa,
on the banks of the river Ganges. Arjuna then described
to him how he came into possession of this missile. This
powerful missile was given first to Bhāradvāja by Bṛhas-
pati and Bharadvāja gave it to Agniveśya who in turn
gave it to Droṇa and the latter gave it to Arjuna, his
most favourite disciple. (Ślokas 29-30, Chapter 170, Ādi
Parva, M.B.).
