VARGĀ¦. A celestial maid. There is a story in Mahā-
bhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 220, describing how Vargā
and her friends were changed into crocodiles and had
to live in water for a long time.
<div n="NI"/>Once there lived an ‘apsaras’ (celestial maid) named
Vargā in Devāraṇya. She had four friends called
Saurabheyī, Samīcī, Budbudā and Latā. Once they were
going to the house of Kubera their patron. On the way
they saw a hermit. They saw the whole forest
shining with the radiance of the power of penance
of the hermit. They decided to entice the hermit

somehow. With this intention they entered
his hermitage. Seeing their dalliance and co-
quetry, the hermit got angry and cursed them to
become crocodiles for a hundred years. They implored
him with tears, for liberation from the curse. The
hermit told them that in due course a noble man would
come and get them out of water and that then they
would obtain their original form. They walked towards
a lake.
<div n="NI"/>On the way they saw Nārada. They told him every-
thing. He told them. “On the coast of the southern
ocean there are five tīrthas (holy baths) known as
Agastya, Saubhadra, Pauloma, Kārandhama and
Suprasanna. You may go to these lakes and live there
as crocodiles one in each. In due course Arjuna, the son
of Pāṇḍu will come and redeem you.”
<div n="NI"/>According to the words of Nārada the five celestial
maids walked to the south and reached the Pañcatīrtha
(the five holy baths) and each of them entered a lake
as a crocodile. After this nobody dared to live near
those holy baths. After some time Arjuna started on his
pilgrimage. He passed through many places and reach-
ed the Pañcatīrtha. He enquired why the place was
forsaken by people. The hermits told him that there
was a crocodile in each of the five baths and that they
would eat anybody who got into the bath. Arjuna got
into a lake. Immediately a crocodile came and caught
hold of him. With great difficulty he dragged it out of
the lake. Instantly the crocodile changed into a beauti-
ful damsel. The celestial maid Vargā told the amazed
Arjuna her story and she added that her four friends
were lying in the neighbouring four lakes. Arjuna redeem-
ed every one of them. After this, Vargā and her
friends went to Devāraṇya and Arjuna to Maṇalūra.
From that day onwards the five tīrthas came to be known
as Nārītīrthas.
