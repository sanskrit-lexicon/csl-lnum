BODHYA¦. A famous teacher-priest. Once there was a
discussion between Nahuṣa and Bodhya on Philosophy.
The summary of what Bodhya said is as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Before I advise others, I do it myself first. I am the tea-
cher of none. I take the world as my teacher. I learned
the lessons of harmlessness from snakes, disappointment
from Piṅgala the harlot, self-sacrifice from animals,
concentration from the archer, and loneliness from a maid
who is a spinster. (M.B., Śānti Parva, 171, 56, 61).
<div n="NI"/>This hermit came to the King Yayāti and taught him
philosophy and ethics. The whole of the Chapter 171
of Mahābhārata, Śānti Parva, comprises the exhortations
of this hermit, which are known by the famous name
Bodhya-Gītā (Song of Bodhya).
