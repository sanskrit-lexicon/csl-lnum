BHAIRAVA II¦. A Pārṣada of Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Immediately after his birth, this terrible
monster subdued all the Devas without getting the
permission of Śiva. Enraged at it, Śiva turned him into
a tree by a curse. But Śiva was soon pacified and lifted
the curse by declaring that those who offered pūjā to
the gods would get the full reward for their worship
only if they offered pūjā to Bhairava also.
<div n="NI"/>Bhairava became a tree as soon as he was cursed. He
became a tree because he subdued the gods. Therefore
that tree came to be called “DAMANAKA” tree
(Damana = Subdue). It has another name. “TĀTIRI”
tree. Even now, pious people offer pūjā to this tree.
(Agni Purāṇa, Chapters 52-80).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Once Brahmā and Viṣṇu became swollen
with pride. In his haughty way, Brahmā insulted Śiva.
Under the insult, Śiva was infuriated and out of the
fire of his fury was born Bhairava with his black form.
(Liṅga Purāṇa 1.90).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Brahmahatyā.%} As soon as he was born, Bhairava
rushed towards Brahmā and pinched off his fifth head
which had insulted Śiva. By this, he incurred the sin
of Brahmahatyā. For the expiation of this sin, as
ordered by Śiva, Bhairava started on a journey to go
abegging, with Brahmā's severed head in his hand.
Śiva then created a woman named “Brahmahatyā”
and asked her to follow Bhairava.
<div n="NI"/>Although Bhairava visited many holy places, he was
not able to liberate himself from the sin of Brahma-
hatyā. At last, at the suggestion of Śiva, he went to
Vārāṇasī and washed off his sin. Brahmā's head which
he carried, was also deposited there and the place be-
came famous under the name of “Kapālamocana
tīrtha”. (Śiva Purāṇa, Śatarudra Saṃhitā).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Family.%} In Kālikā Purāṇa there is an elaborate
account of the family of Bhairava. According to this
Purāṇa, Vijaya, the reputed King of Vārāṇasī was born
in the family of Bhairava. Kālikā Purāṇa also says
that Vijaya destroyed the Khāṇḍavī city and set up
the Khāṇḍava forest in its place.
<div n="NI"/>According to Kālikā Purāṇa, Bhairava and Vetāla
were, in their previous births, two Śivapārṣadas named
Mahākāla and Bhṛṅgi. It was by the curse of Pārvatī.
[Page115-b+ 64]
that they were born as mortals in their next birth.
(Kālikā Purāṇa 53).
<div n="NI"/>The Purāṇas mention eight Bhairavas called Asitāṃga,
Ruru, Caṇḍa, Krodha, Unmatta, Kapāli, Bhīṣaṇa and
Saṃhāra.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Shape.%} Bhairava has a terrible shape. He wears the
crescent moon and plaited hair on his head. His wea-
pons are, sword, arrow, dagger, bow, trident, rope
etc. At times he is dressed in elephant-skin. He has
five faces. Serpents are his ornaments. (Agni Purāṇa,
Chapters 52-80).
