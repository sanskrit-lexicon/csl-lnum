DHANAPĀLA¦. A Vaiśya who lived in the city of Ayo-
dhyā. He built in Ayodhyā a temple for the Sun-god
and appointed, for a year, paying his wages in advance,
a scholar well versed in Purāṇas to read aloud the
Purāṇas in the temple. After six months Dhanapāla
died and as a result of the goodness accrued to him by
his worthy deeds the Sun-god came to him with his
chariot and took him to his place and seating him on
his seat paid respects to him. Later he was taken to
Brahmaloka. (Bhaviṣya Purāṇa, Brahma Kāṇḍa,
Chapter 94).
