BHŪ¦(Ḥ). In the creation of the world, the Lord broke
the beginningless “Aṇḍa” (the primal egg or seed)
and from it the sound “Oṃ” emerged. The first sound
of it was “BHŪḤ”; the second was “BHUVAḤ”;
and the third was “SVAḤ”. So the combination “Bhūr
Bhuvaḥ Svaḥ” was formed. Then came the most
adorable and superlative effulgence of the creator
(Savitā). That radiance dried up all water. A little of
the water became a highly viscous substance. This
viscous matter gradually solidified and became the earth.
Where the aṇḍa originally was became the source of
that supreme effulgence. As it was the first radiant
light, it came to be called Āditya (ādi=first). The
great procreator Brahmā seemed to emerge from the
centre of the aṇḍa. The garbhajala (the water contai-
ned in the aṇḍa) became the oceans and rivers of the
world. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 43).
