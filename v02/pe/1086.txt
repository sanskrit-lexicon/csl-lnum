BHĀRYĀ¦. Wife. Bhīṣma points out the sanctified impor-
tance of Bhāryā (wife) as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Without her even the palace will prove itself to be just a
forest. She will be a great support (to the husband) in
the matter of dharma (duty) artha (wealth) and Kāma
(enjoyment of material comforts). (These three precede
the ultimate state of Mokṣa (salvation) and the wife will
be a great support in fulfilling the conditions during the
first three stages.) While on tour in foreign places she
will remain faithful to him and instil confidence in him.
Bhāryā is great wealth to man.
<div n="NI"/>In his forlorn life on earth the wife is of great help to
man. To him, who is suffering from diseases and is
otherwise in distress there is no remedy (medicine) like
a good wife. There is no relative like a wife. In the
matter of practising dharma there is no other support to
match the wife. If one has no good wife to take care of
domestic affairs one will be driven to the forest; the
home will be like a forest. (Śānti Parva, Chapter 144).
