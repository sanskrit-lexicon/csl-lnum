STHĀṆUSTHĀNA¦. A holy place. This place is situated
on the eastern bank of the river Sarasvatī. Vasiṣṭha
had once built his hermitage here. This place became
a holy tīrtha since god Sthāṇu had performed penance
here. It is said that the devas anointed Subrahmaṇya
as the commander of the army, at this place. (M.B.
Śalya Parva, Chapter 45, Verse 48).
