DEVAYĀNĪ¦. Sukrācārya's daughter.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Svāyambhuvamanu, son of Brahmā had two
sons: Priyavrata and Uttānapāda. Priyavrata wedded
Surūpā and Barhiṣmatī, two very beautiful daughters
of Viśvakarmaprajāpati, and he had by Surūpā ten
sons called Agnīdhra, Idhmajihvā, Yajñabāhu,
Mahāvīra, Rukmasukra, Ghṛtapṛṣṭha, Savana, Medhā-
tithi, Vītihotra and Kavi as also a daughter called
Ūrjasvatī who was the youngest of the whole lot. Of
the above ten sons Kavi, Savana and Mahāvīra were
spiritual giants and great sages. Uttama, Tāpasa and
Raivata, the three sons of Priyavrata by his second wife
Barhiṣmatī turned out to be manvantarādhipatis.
Ūrjasvatī, the only daughter of Priyavrata was married
to Śukrācārya, preceptor of the asuras. Devayānī was
Śukrācārya's daughter by Ūrjasvatī. (Devībhāgavata,
Aṣṭama Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Curse by Kaca.%} Kaca, son of Bṛhaspati became
Śukrācārya's disciple to learn Mṛtasañjīvanī vidyā
(the science to ward off death for ever). Devayānī
fell madly in love with Kaca. But, after his studies
under her father were over Kaca returned to devaloka
without marrying Devayānī, who cursed that Kaca's
[Page215-b+ 65]
learning should prove useless. And, Kaca cursed her
in return that nobody from devaloka should marry
her. (For details see Kaca).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Devayānī in a neglected well.%} Once Vṛṣaparvan was the
king of the asuras, and Śukrācārya lived in his palace.
Śarmiṣṭhā, the daughter of the king and Devayānī, the
daughter of Śukrācārya became thick friends. While
one day these two friends with their companions were
engaged in water sports Indra came that way. Very
much interested in seeing the deva damsels thus engaged
in water sports Indra assumed the form of air and blew
off the dresses of the damsels from the shore while they
were playing in the river. The damsels hurriedly got
out of water, ran after the fleeing garments and put
on whatever came to their hands. In the confusion what
Śarmiṣṭhā got and wore was Devayānī's clothes. Devayānī
ran after Śarmiṣṭhā and caught hold of the clothes, but
the latter did not yield them to her. Both of them
indulged in hot words against each other, Śarmiṣṭhā
calling Śukrācārya a beggar living in her father's
palace for his food. Not only that, she pushed Devayānī
into a neglected well and went her way.
<div n="NI"/>At that time prince Yayāti, son of Nahuṣa, was hunting
in that forest. Feeling very thirsty he came to the well
for a drink and therein saw Devayānī in tears. He
brought her out from the well and leaving her there
went on his way.
<div n="NI"/>Śukrācārya and his wife actually got anxious and upset
that their daughter had not returned even after the
lapse of so much time and deputed their servant
Gurṇikā to seek for Devayānī. She found her out in
the forest. But, Devayānī refused to return home as
she did not want to continue as the daughter of one
who lived on the charity of Śarmiṣṭhā and her father.
Gurṇikā carried back this news to Śukrācārya, who then
went himself to the forest and met his daughter. He
felt deeply wounded to hear about the insults heaped
on his daughter by Śarmiṣṭhā, and sent word to
Vṛṣaparvan that they were not returning to the palace.
Vṛṣaparvan realised that if Śukrācārya quarrelled
with him the whole asura world also would become
divided. He, therefore, tried his best to pacify the
ācārya and his daughter. At last Devayānī agreed to re-
turn to the palace in case Śarmiṣṭhā went to her with one
thousand of her maids to serve as her (Devayānī's) maids.
Vṛṣaparvan acted accordingly and Devayānī was
satisfied and returned to the palace with her father.
(Ādi Parva, Chapter 78 onwards.)
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Wedding of Devayānī.%} Some time afterwards when
Devayānī was sporting in the forest with Śarmiṣṭhā and
others, King Yayāti happened to pass that way. They
recognised each other and Devayānī requested Yayāti
to marry her as she had mentally chosen him as her
husband on the very same day on which he had saved
her from the well.
<div n="NI"/>Yayāti realised only too well that it was really danger-
ous to marry the daughter of Śukrācārya in the forest
secretly and he, therefore, rejected Devayānī's request.
But, she got down her father there and with his per-
mission Yayāti married her. He also got much wealth
by way of dowry. Śarmiṣṭhā and her maids accompanied
Devayānī but Sukrācārya warned Yayāti that on no
account should he touch Śarmiṣṭhā.
<div n="NI"/>With his wife and her attendants Yayāti returned to
his palace; but he put Śarmiṣṭhā and her maids in
[Page216-a+ 70]
a place newly built for the purpose. Devayānī delivered
a child in due course and it was named Yadu. Śarmiṣ-
ṭhā one day met Yayāti in the forest and requested
for a child by him. Though at first he was reluctant to
oblige remembering only too well the injunction of
Śukrācārya, he at last succumbed to the eloquence of
Śarmiṣṭhā. She got pregnant by him and the child
she delivered was called Druhyu.
<div n="NI"/>Devayānī was alarmed at the birth of a child to
Śarmiṣṭha, who was unmarried, and questioned her
about it. Śarmiṣṭhā's answer that a brahmin stranger,
who came that way was the father of her child satisfied
Devayānī.
<div n="NI"/>Ere long another son, Turvasu, was born to Devayānī,
and Śarmiṣṭhā too delivered two children called
Anudruhyu and Pūru. Thus the mistress (Devayānī)
had two sons and her servant, Śarmiṣṭhā three sons.
<div n="NI"/>While Yayāti and Devayānī were one day strolling in
the garden the sons of Śarmiṣṭhā came there. She
noticed the close resemblance of those boys to her
husband (Yayāti) and it kindled her wrath. Though
Yayāti did not, because of the presence of Devayānī,
notice the children, when she asked them who their
father was, they answered “Yayāti”, whereupon in
great rage she ran up to her father. Yayāti too followed
her. Devayānī told her father about the infidelity of
Yayāti and he (Śukra) cursed that Yayāti be afflicted
with old age. When Yayāti asked for redemption from
the curse Śukrācārya told him that he could exchange
his old age for the youth of somebody else.
<div n="NI"/>Yayāti then called together all his five sons and asked
them whether anyone of them was prepared to exchange
his (son's) youth for his (Yayāti's) old age for one
thousand years. The three elder sons refused to agree
to the proposal, but the fourth son Pūru gladly exchan-
ged his youth with his father's old age. After spending
his life in youthful enjoyment for one thousand
years Yayāti returned his youth to Pūru, and Pūru
assumed Kingship of the country. (Ādi Parva, Chapters
81-83).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Synonyms for Devayānī.%} Auśanasī, Śukratanayā and
Bhārgavī.
