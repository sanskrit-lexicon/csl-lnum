SAṄKOCA¦. One of the Rākṣasas, who, in ancient days
ruled the earth and ultimately died. The story of
Saṅkoca was told by Bhīṣma to Yudhiṣṭhira to prove
the truth that even the greatest and most powerful has,
one day or other, to quit life and die. Among such
great ones are included Pṛthu, Aila, Maya, Bhauma,
Naraka, Śambara, Hayagrīva, Pulomā, Svarbhānu,
Prahlāda, Namuci, Dakṣa, Vipracitti, Virocana,
Suhotra, Vṛṣa, Vṛṣabha, Kapilāśva, Virūpa, Bāṇa,
Kārtasvara, and Viśvadaṃṣṭra. Though all of them

were once emperors they had to give room to the next
generation. Bhīṣma, on his bed of arrows, was thus
describing the transience of life. (Śānti Parva, Chapter
277).
