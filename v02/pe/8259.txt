VIDURA I¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Vidura was a superhuman
being, very famous in the story of Mahābhārata, as a
brother of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, as a man of colossal intelligence
who had been closely watching the goings and comings
of the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas, as the adviser of
Dhṛtarāṣṭra, and as a man of immense learning and
wisdom.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Incarnation af Dharmadeva.%} There is a story in Mahā-
Bhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 107, which describes
Vidura as born from a portion of Dharmadeva. The
story is given below.
<div n="NI"/>Long ago there was a hermit called Māṇḍavya in India.
As he was standing in deep meditation near his hermit-
age, the men of the King chased some thieves and came
to the place where the hermit stood. The robbers
placed the stolen property near the hermit and ran
away. The king's men caught the hermit, and the
thieves. The King ordered them to be placed on a
trident. The thieves died on the trident. But Māṇḍavya
was not dead. The King sawed the trident and got
Māṇḍavya down. The hermit went to Dharmadeva and
asked him what his blame was for suffering the punish-
ment of the trident on him. Dharmadeva replied that
the punishment was inflicted for a cruel deed he had
done in his childhood. He had caught some flies and
made a bunch of them by piercing them with the rib of
a coconut-palm leaf. But Māṇḍavya argued that
Dharmadeva was not right in punishing him because
the Śāstras and rules of righteousness said that mistakes
committed by boys below the age of twelve could not
be considered to be sins. Further he cursed Dharmadeva
that he would take birth on the earth from the womb
of a Śūdrā. Accordingly Dharmadeva took birth from
the womb of the servant of Ambikā and Ambālikā.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Birth.%} Vidura was born as the brother of Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra and Pāṇḍu. (For detailed story see under Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra I, para 2).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Up to marriage.%} Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Pāṇḍu and Vidura
spent their younger days in Hastināpura as inseparable
brothers. Their teacher was Bhīṣma. Vidura learned
the Vedas, Śāstras, Purāṇas, Itihāsas etc. also, along
with the education given to a prince such as archery,
club-fight, sword-fight, wrestling, controlling elephants
etc. He understood that to be righteous was far better
[Page848-b+ 64]
than fighting. It is stated in Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva,
Chapter 108, that Vidura got the sense of righteousness,
and education in fighting, at the same time.
<div n="NI"/>Childhood ended. As Vidura was born to a Brahmin
by a Śūdrā woman he had no right to become King.
When he grew up, the duty to find a wife for him fell
on Bhīṣma. At that time a damsel born to a Brahmin
by a Śūdrā woman was being brought up in the palace
of King Devaka. With the permission of Devaka, Bhīṣma
brought the girl and gave her in marriage to Vidura.
It is stated in Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 114,
that sons and daughters were born to the couple.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Partiality towards the Pāṇḍavas.%} Vidura was the most
intelligent and wisest man of his time, and he always
favoured righteousness. Though he viewed the Kauravas
and the Pāṇḍavas with equal favour, in his heart he
felt some partiality towards the Pāṇḍavas, because they
were virtuous, whereas the Kauravas were becoming
more and more wicked. As this partiality arose from
his sense of righteousness, nobody could blame Vidura
for this. His aim was the prosperity of the Lunar
dynasty of Kings.
<div n="NI"/>Many ill omens were seen at the time of the birth
of Duryodhana. Vidura understood that if that infant
grew up he would be a comet to the Lunar dynasty. It
is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 115,
that Vidura advised Dhṛtarāṣṭra that it would be better
for him to throw away that infant.
<div n="NI"/>The death of Pāṇḍu drew Vidura closer to the Pāṇḍavas.
Vidura took the lead in performing the funeral rites
and other ceremonies which followed. The Pāṇḍavas.
were very sad and miserable at the death of their father.
It was at this time that Duryodhana poisoned Bhīma-
sena, tied him with a rope and threw him into the
river Ganges. Bhīmasena was carried to the world of
nāgas (serpents). Kuntī felt grieved at the loss of her
son Bhīma, but Vidura consoled her.
<div n="NI"/>It was due to the wisdom of Vidura that the Pāṇḍavas
escaped from the disaster in the lac-house. As soon as
Duryodhana had completed the lac-house, Vidura
understood the deception lying hidden under it.
and he informed the Pāṇḍavas of everything about it.
Moreover he sent a man named Khanaka and made
an underground passage from the lac-house. When the
lac-house was burnt down, the Pāṇḍavas escaped by
the under-ground passage and reached the banks of
the Ganges. Vidura had sent a ferryman secretly to
take them to the other side of the Ganges. When
Bhīṣma got the news that the Pāṇḍavas had been burnt
to death in the lac-house he became very sad. It is
mentioned in Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter
149, that Vidura informed Bhīṣma secretly that the
Pāṇḍavas were not dead.
<div n="NI"/>After this event the Pāṇḍavas come into the scene only
at the Svayaṃvara (marriage) of Pāñcālī. Bhīṣma and
Droṇa proposed that the Pāṇḍavas should be brought
back and be given half of the kingdom. Vidura, by his
arugments convinced Dhṛtarāṣṭra that the proposal of
Bhīṣma and Droṇa was correct. Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked
Vidura to bring the Pāṇḍavas back. Vidura went to
the city of Drupada and brought the Pāṇḍavas back
and consoled their mother Kuntī. After this Yudhiṣṭhira
performed Rājasūya (sacrifice of royal consecration).
Vidura took part in it and took the charge of financial
[Page849-a+ 65]
part of the sacrifice. It was after this that Duryodhana
challenged Yudhiṣṭhira for a game of dice. Vidura saw
beforehand that this move on the part of Duryodhana
was dangerous. So he talked forcibly against this, and
gave warning to all concerned. As Duryodhana did not
agree with Vidura, he was scolded. But Duryodhana
was firm and the game was conducted. Pāñcālī was
harassed by means of stripping and the Pāṇḍavas went
to the forest. It is stated in Mahābhārata, Vana Parva,
Chapter 3, that Vidura had been witnessing all these
scenes with wet eyes.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Separated from the Pāṇḍavas.%} When the Pāṇḍavas
were driven to the forest, Dhṛtarāṣṭra felt sorry. He
became more afraid of the people than he was sorry
for the Pāṇḍavas. He understood that his subjects
would unite and rise against his sons. He called
Vidura and asked him for a remedy. Vidura who was
full of impatience, made a speech against the wicked-
ness of the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra and advised him to
forsake his own sons and to bring the Pāṇḍavas back
and give them the kingdom. Dhṛtarāṣṭra did not like
this approach. He said that Vidura was partial to the
Pāṇḍavas and asked him to go away from the palace.
Vidura became grieved at this. He followed the
Pāṇḍavas, and walking a long distance, reached the
forest Kāmyaka and met the Pāṇḍavas.
<div n="NI"/>When Vidura had gone Dhṛtarāṣṭra felt miserable.
He sent for Vidura and when he returned Dhṛtarāṣṭra
begged for pardon. Vidura again became the adviser
of Dhṛtarāṣṭra. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 6).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Adviser of Dhṛtarāṣṭra.%} The advice of Vidura is
famous in Mahābhārata. The main duty of Vidura was
to console Dhṛtarāṣṭra by speaking about righteousness
when he became troubled in mind because of the const-
ant quarrels between his sons and the Pāṇḍavas.
Vidura fulfilled his duty well. Duryodhana was firm on
the point that not a dot of land would be given to the
Pāṇḍavas. Śrī Kṛṣṇa came to Hastināpura as mediator.
Duryodhana showed disrespect to him. Vidura said
in strong words that it was wrong on the part of
Duryodhana to have done so and compelled Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra to show due respect and hospitality to Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
Accordingly Dhṛtarāṣṭra welcomed Śrī Kṛṣṇa and
showed respect and hospitality. Knowing this, Duryo-
dhana and his brothers tried to make Śrī Kṛṣṇa a
captive. Vidura harshly scolded them for this attempt.
Seeing all these impudent actions on the part of his
sons, Dhṛtarāṣṭra became distressed. Vidura consoled
him by good exhortations. He told Dhṛtarāṣṭra about
the transience of life and the importance of the soul.
When the battle was fiercely going on in the battle-
ground of Kurukṣetra, Vidura remained with Dhrta-
rāṣṭra consoling him and giving him good advice. The
death of Bhīṣma was an unbearable grief to Vidura. He
took part in the funeral of Bhīṣma. He himself placed
the body on the funeral pyre. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva,
Chapter 168, Stanza 11).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Pilgrimage.%} When Vidura failed in his attempt to
ward off a pitched battle between the Kauravas and
the Pāṇḍavas he felt extremely miserable. Without
taking part in the battle, he started on a pilgrimage.
Getting the news at Prabhāsaksetra about the end of
the battle, he went to the basin of river Yamunā. On
the way he heard the news of the passing away of Śrī
Kṛṣṇa, from Uddhava. Before death Śrī Kṛṣṇa had
[Page849-b+ 64]
revealed that Vidura had heard Uddhavagītā from
Maitreya. This book which is in the form of a conver-
sation between Vidura and Maitreya contains the talk
between Kapila and Devahūti. Description of the line
of Manus, sacrifice of Dakṣa, story of Dhruva, story
of Pṛthu, story of Purañjana etc. were the subjects of the
talk. (Bhāgavata, 3—4).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%End.%} The Bhārata-battle came to an end. The
Kauravas were exterminated. Efforts were begun to
establish law and order. In all these efforts Vidura was
a help to the Pāṇḍavas. Still he spent most of his time
with the old Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Yudhiṣṭhira came to Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra and both embraced each other. Seeing this
Vidura cried aloud. Vidura advised Yudhiṣṭhira how
to carry on the administration of the new government.
After this he decided to go to the forest to spend his
last days. Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Gāndhārī, Kuntī, Vidura and
Śakuni went to the forest. The Pāṇḍavas tried in vain
to prevent them from going. When Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
Gāndhārī, Kuntī, Vidura, Sañjaya and others started
for the forest, even Bhīmasena cried aloud. Pāṇḍavas
and the people of the city went along with them up to
the river Ganges. On the bank of the Ganges near the
hermitage of Śatayūpa, a hermitage was erected and
Vidura and the others lived there.
<div n="NI"/>They lived there for nearly six years. The Pāṇḍavas be-
came unable to bear the separation from their elders.
Once Dharmaputra dreamt about his mother. Next day
the Pāṇḍavas went to the banks of the Ganges. Pāñcālī,
Subhadrā, Uttarā and many people of the city followed
them. They went to the Śatayūpa-hermitage and saw
Dhṛtarāṣṭra and the others. But the great Vidura was
not there. When asked about it he got the reply that
having become abstemious and having no more desires
he was wandering about. Yudhiṣṭhira was greatly
troubled.
<div n="NI"/>Next day at dawn when Yudhiṣṭhira went to bathe in
the Ganges, on the way he saw Vidura sitting in contem-
plation with a stone in his mouth. Yudhiṣṭhira stood
with joined palms before the lean and weak form of
that sage and said “Look, Dharmaputra bows before
you.” He repeated this several times. But there was
no change in Vidura. Yudhiṣṭhira's disappointment
did not last long. For, in a short while Dharmaputra
saw that a divine radiance emanated from the body
of Vidura and passed on to his body and that the body
of Vidura fell lifeless on the ground. This union took
place because both Vidura and Yudhiṣṭhira were port-
ions of Dharmadeva. After this Dharmaputra made
preparations to burn the body of Vidura. Then an ethe-
real voice said “Vidura is abstemious. His body should
not be burned.” Dharmaputra went to the hermitage
and informed all, about the death of Vidura. (M.B.
Āśramavāsika Parva, Chapters 26 to 28).
<div n="NI"/>Mention is made in Mahābhārata, Svargārohaṇa Parva,
Chapter 5, Stanza 22, that Vidura entered Svarga
(heaven) and stays there in the form of Dharmadeva.
