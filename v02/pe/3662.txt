KṚṢṆA¦ (ŚRĪ KṚṢṆA). Born in the Yādava dynasty
as the son of Vasudeva and Devakī, Śrī Kṛṣṇa was the
ninth of the ten incarnations of Mahāviṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus:—Brahmā

<div n="NI"/>Ten sons called Vasudeva, Devabhāga, Devaśravas,
Ānaka, Sṛñjaya, Kākānīka, Śyāmaka, Vatsa, Kāvūka
and Vasu were born to King Śūrasena by his wife
Māriṣā. Of those ten sons Vasudeva married Devakī,
the sister of Kaṃsa. He had also a second wife called
Rohiṇī and she was the mother of Balabhadrarāma.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Śrī Kṛṣṇa's former births.%} Owing to a curse of
Varuṇa, Kaśyapaprajāpati was born on earth as
Vasudeva and his (Kaśyapa) wives Aditi and Surasā
were born as Devakī and Rohiṇī. (See under Kaśyapa
and Aditi). Like this Śrī Kṛṣṇa also had previous births.
Once upon a time from the heart of Brahmā was
born the Prajāpati called Dharma, who was very truth-
ful and wedded to righteous living according to the
injunctions of the Vedas. He wedded the ten daughters
of Dakṣaprajāpati, and four sons called Hari, Kṛṣṇa
Nara and Nārāyaṇa were born to him. Hari and
Kṛṣṇa turned out to be great Yogins, and Nara and
Nārāyaṇa ascetics. Naranārāyaṇas performed penance
to please Brahmā for a thousand years at Badarik-
āśrama in the valley of the Himālayas. Celestial
women, whom Indra had deputed to break their
penance, approached them and requested them to take
them (celestial women) as their wives. Ascetic Nārā-
yaṇa who got angry at the celestial women's request
was about to curse them when sage Nara intervened
and pacified him. Then sage Nārāyaṇa told them
thus:—“You must protect my Vrata (penance) in
[Page420-b+ 64]
this life. In that case, in the next birth I shall satisfy
your desire. In the 28th Dvāparayuga I will be
incarnating on earth on behalf of the Devas. Then you
also may be born as princesses. I shall incarnate as
Kṛṣṇa in the Yadu dynasty and marry all of you.
(Bhāgavata, 4th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>Accordingly sage Nārāyaṇa was born as Śrī Kṛṣṇa in
the Yadu dynasty, and sage Nara was born as Arjuna to
be his companion.
<div n="NI"/>The curse of Bhṛgu the great sage also contributed to
Mahāviṣṇu's incarnating himself as Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Once
in a war which lasted for 100 years between the Devas
and the Asuras most of the latter were killed. Then
Śukra, preceptor of the Asuras went to Mount
Kailāsa to secure exceptional weapons, and the Asuras
took refuge under Kāvyamātā, the mother of Śukra.
Devendra sought Mahāviṣṇu's aid, and he cut off
Kāvyamātā's head with his Cakra (discus). Bhṛgu
was enraged at this killing of a woman. He cursed that
Mahāviṣṇu should be born as man. Owing to various
reasons like the above Mahāviṣṇu happened to be
born as man in the Yādava dynasty, as the son of
Vasudeva. (Devī Bhāgavata, 5th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Vasudeva's wedding.%} To Śūrasena, the Yādava King
of Mathurāpurī was born a son called Vasudeva, and
Devakī was born as the grand-daughter of Devaka, the
brother of Ugrasena, another Yādava King. Devakī
was the sister of Kaṃsa. Devakī was given in marriage
to Vasudeva with a dowry of twelve bhāras (a
particular weight) of gold and a chariot. Kaṃsa
acted as charioteer in the wedding procession during
which a celestial voice addressed Kaṃsa as follows:—
‘Asyāḥ tvām aṣṭamagarbho hantā’ (Her eighth son
will kill you). As soon as he heard the celestial voice
Kaṃsa stood up in the chariot ablaze with rage. He
caught hold of Devakī by her hair and raised his
sword to cut her throat. All the conciliatory words of
Vasudeva failed to pacify Kaṃsa. Then Vasudeva
promised to hand over to Kaṃsa all the children born
to Devakī immediately after their birth. Accordingly
Kaṃsa left them alone.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%First-born son of Vasudeva.%} The first-born child of
Vasudeva was duly handed over to Kaṃsa. But, he
returned the child to its parents as, according to the
celestial voice the first-born child was not to be his
enemy. Vasudeva and Devakī brought it up under the
name Kīrtimān. On one of those days Nārada visited
Kaṃsa and told him about his previous life, the
object of Kṛṣṇa's incarnation etc. Then it was that
Kaṃsa realised how fatal to him was the existence of
Vasudeva and Devakī, and he hurried up to them and
killed the child by dashing its head against a rock. He
also kept them chained in prison.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Kaṃsa's excitement.%} The information imparted by
Nārada upset Kaṃsa much. He shut his father
Ugrasena in prison and himself became King. He
deputed Asuras like Pralamba, Cāṇūra, Tṛṇāvarta,
Muṣṭika, Ariṣṭa, Keśī, Dhenuka, Agha, Vivida and
Pūtanā to harass the Yādavas, the Andhakas and the
Vṛṣṇis. After the death of Kīrtimān, Devakī, in the
prison, delivered five sons. (See under Kaṃsa. Para 2
for the previous history of the first six sons of Devakī).
Kaṃsa killed all the five children also as soon as they
were born.
[Page421-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Birth of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.%} The Asuras killed in the old
Devāsura war were later born as cruel and evil Kings
on earth. The burden of such Kings having become
too much for her, goddess Earth, in the guise of a cow
complained about it to Brahmā who took her to Śiva
who too could not find a solution to the problem posed
by Bhūmidevī. So, all of them accompanied by the
Devas approached Mahāviṣṇu and prayed for the
redress of their grievance. Mahāviṣṇu sent them back
comforted by the assurance that he would be born as
the son of Vasudeva and Devakī to solve the problem.
He also arranged the Devas to be born as Gopas and
the Apsarā women as Gopikās on earth for his
assistance.
<div n="NI"/>Devakī conceived for the 7th time, and it was an aspect
of Ananta. Mahāviṣṇu instructed Māyādevī thus:
“You go to the earth and transfer the child in Devakī's
womb to that of Rohiṇī, the second wife of Vasudeva
and after that, at the very time of my birth you
should be born as daughter of Yaśodā, wife of
Nandagopa. You would be worshipped by the world
in various names like Ambikā, Nārāyaṇī, Caṇḍikā,
Durgā, Bhadrakālī etc. The child transferred by you to
the womb of Rohiṇī will become known as Saṅkarṣaṇa,
Balabhadra and Rāma.
<div n="NI"/>Accordingly Māyādevī transferred the child in Devakī's
womb to that of Rohiṇī, and it was given out that the
seventh child of Devakī was aborted in the womb.
Devakī conceived for the eighth time, and on Aṣṭamī
day in the month of Siṃha (Leo, August-September)
when the Brāhma stars were collected on the same day
was Śrī Kṛṣṇa born. Mahāviṣṇu incarnated himself
as Kṛṣṇa with the conch, the discus, the club and the
lotus flower in his four hands. Vasudeva saluted the
marvellous child, and the chain that bound himself
and Devakī broke asunder, and the new-born child
spoke thus to Vasudeva:—“In Svāyambhuva Manvan-
tara the Prajāpati called Sutapas with his wife Pṛśni
meditated upon me for 12,000 years, and when I
appeared to them and asked them to choose any boon
they prayed for my being born as their son. In the
next life Sutapas was born as Kaśyapa and Pṛśni as
Aditi, and I incarnated in the form of Vāmana
(Dwarf) as their son. Afterwards Kaśyapa and Aditi
took various births, and I too took various births as
their son. Now also, Kaśyapa and Aditi, are born as
Vasudeva and Devakī. Just at this time a daughter
has been born to Nandagopa and Yaśodā at Gokula.
You shall take me over there and replace me with the
child born at Gokula.” After having told Vasudeva
the above facts Kṛṣṇa assumed the form of an ordinary
child and lay by the side of its mother. At mid-night
when the guards at the prison house were deep in sleep
the doors of the prison opened by themselves. Vasudeva
with the child Kṛṣṇa, started for Gokula and on his
way the river Yamunā changed its course for him to
proceed. The doors of Yaśodā's house were open.
Owing to the divine prowess of Māyādevī, the child of
Yaśodā, everybody in the house went into deep sleep.
Vasudeva placed Kṛṣṇa by the side of Yśodaā and
returned home with her child. As soon as he had thus
returned the prison-guards woke up and reported to
Kaṃsa about the delivery of a child by Devakī.
Kaṃsa rushed to the house, caught hold of the child
and was about to dash it against the rock when lo!
[Page421-b+ 64]
the child slipped free of his hands and rose in the sky
wherefrom it spoke as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Oh! unrighteous and cruel Kaṃsa! thy prowess is
not to be exhibited against women. Thy killer is born
on earth, and search for him everywhere. (Śiva Purāṇa,
Chapter 1).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Colour of Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadrarāma.%} Śrī Kṛṣṇa
was dark in colour and Balabhadra white. There is a
story in the Mahābhārata to explain this difference in
their colour. The Devas informed Mahāviṣṇu of their
decision to incarnate themselves on earth for the
annihilation of the evil and cruel people. Pleased at
their decision Viṣṇu plucked from his head a black
hair and also a white hair and threw them on the
ground, and he said that the black hair would enter
Devakī and be born as Kṛṣṇa while the white one
would enter Rohiṇī and be born as Balabhadra.
Accordingly Kṛṣṇa became of the colour of the cloud
(black) and Balabhadra white in colour. (Ādi Parva,
Chapter 199, Verse 31).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%The incidents during the childhood of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.%}
(1) {%Pūtanāmokṣa (Salvation to Pūtanā).%} Pūtanā, a
Rākṣasī and one of the assassins deputed by Kaṃsa to
search out and kill Kṛṣṇa, went to Kṛṣṇa's house
disguised as a Gopa woman and fed him on her breasts.
But the child extracted her life also with her breast-
milk, and she assumed her original form and fell down
dead.
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Śakaṭāsura killed.%} Kaṃsa next deputed the Asura
called Śakaṭa to kill Kṛṣṇa. He approached the
sleeping Kṛṣṇa in the form of a cart and raised great
sound. Kṛṣṇa jumped awake and kicked the cart into
hundreds of pieces. (See under Śakaṭa).
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%Killed Tṛṇāvartāsura.%} Tṛṇāvarta, son of Tārakāsura,
at the behest of Kaṃsa went to Ambāḍi in an invisible
(formless) manner. Yaśodā was then breast-feeding
child Kṛṣṇa, and the child appeared to gradually
increase in weight. Yaśodā tried to lay the child on
the bed, but had to lay him on the ground as it was too
heavy for her to lift up to the bed. At once, Tṛṇā-
varta, in the form of a whirl-wind, rose up to the sky
carrying Kṛṣṇa along with him. Ambāḍi (Gokula)
was chokingly filled with clouds of dust; the Gopālas
cried out. But, Śrī Kṛṣṇa clasped round the Asura's
neck and rested, and on account of the child's weight
he could not rise any more. The child hardened its
hands around the Asura's throat and he got killed and
fell down with a thud on a rock. Yaśodā hurriedly
took the child in her hands and covered it with kisses.
(See under Tṛṇāvarta).
<div n="NI"/>(4) {%Naming.%} During this period the famous sage
Garga visited Kṛṣṇa at Ambāḍi, and he informed
Vasudeva and Devakī of the actual facts relating to
Kṛṣṇa. The son of Rohiṇī was brought there, and the
sage named him Rāma, and Yaśodā's child Kṛṣṇa,
and blessed them. Thenceforth Rāma and Kṛṣṇa grew
up in Ambāḍi as the apple of the people's eyes. (See
under Garga).
<div n="NI"/>(5) {%All the worlds in Kṛṣṇa's mouth.%} The Gopikās once
saw Kṛṣṇa eating mud and informed Yaśodā of it, and
she, in great anger, opened the child's mouth to look
for the sand when she saw there all the worlds including
herself and she closed her eyes in great alarm.
(Bhāgavata 10th Skandha).
[Page422-a+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>(6) {%Kṛṣṇa drags Ulūkhala. (Mortar).%} Yaśodā was once
breast-feeding Kṛṣṇa when she noticed milk flowing
out of the boiling pan, and she put the child on the
floor and went to attend to the boiling milk. Angry at
this Kṛṣṇa broke the milk-pot by throwing a stone at
it. Yaśodā then tried to bind the child to the mortar
with a cord. But, any number of cords could not
reach round the child's waist. At this trouble of his
mother Kṛṣṇa decided to oblige her and then the first
cord itself sufficed to bind him round the mortar. But,
Kṛṣṇa then began running, dragging the mortar
behind him. Dragging the Ulūkhala behind him he
passed through a narrow gap between two trees. The
trees were shaken and at once the trees rose up in the
sky as two Devas. The two trees were actually
Nalakūbara and Maṇigrīva, the sons of Vaiśravaṇa,
both of whom had been cursed into the form of trees
by Nārada. (See under Nalakūbara).
<div n="NI"/>(7) {%Vatsāsura killed.%} Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadrarāma
were one day, engaged in sports along with the Gopālas
on the banks of river Kālindī. At that time an Asura
sent by Kaṃsa got into the ranks of the cows disguised
as a cow. Śrī Kṛṣṇa understood it; Balabhadra also
pointed out the new ‘cow’ to him. Then Kṛṣṇa leisure-
ly went towards the herd of cattle, lifted the new ‘cow’
by its legs and tail and dashed it against a peepal
tree. The peepal tree and the one next to it were
broken, and thus ended the life of Vatsāsura.
<div n="NI"/>(8) {%Baka killed%} On another occasion Kaṃsa deputed
Bakāsura, brother of Pūtanā to kill Kṛṣṇa. He assumed
the form of a bird, and lay there on the road with his
fierce mouth wide open. The Gopālas were terror-
stricken. But, Kṛṣṇa entered the cave-like mouth of the
bird leaving his companions behind. The Asura
closed his mouth, and the Gopālas cried out in fear
and agony. But, Śrī Kṛṣṇa stirred round and round
within Baka's stomach and he was forced to vomit
Kṛṣṇa out. Along with Kṛṣṇa he vomited blood and
died. (See under Baka).
<div n="NI"/>(9) {%Killed Aghāsura.%} Aghāsura, brother of Baka and
Pūtanā, deputed by Kaṃsa to kill Kṛṣṇa assumed the
form of a serpent and with its mouth opened like a
cave lay on the road used by the Gopālas. The stench
that emanated from its mouth vitiated the atmosphere.
The Gopālas including Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadra entered
the serpent's mouth, and immediately its entire body
shook and it vomited blood. Life escaped through its
broken stomach. The Gopālas came out of it and fell
down unconscious. But, at the very sight of Kṛṣṇa they
regained consciousness. (See under Agha).
<div n="NI"/>(10) {%Brahmā placed in ridiculous situation.%} On another
occasion Brahmā saw Mahāvisṇu, in the assumed form
of man, playing on the banks of the Kālindī along with
Balabhadra and his companions. To test whether God
possessed powers in the assumed form of man also
Brahmā carried away the cattle of the Gopālas. The
Gopālas were naturally upset at the disappearance of
their cows. After consoling them Kṛṣṇa searched for
the cattle on the heights of mount Govardhana and in
the forest. But, the cattle were to be found nowhere,
and when Kṛṣṇa returned to the banks of the Kālindī
the Gopālas too had disappeared. Divining the reason
for the whole affair by his divine powers, Kṛṣṇa created
both the Gopālas and the cows with his divine powers.
[Page422-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>One year passed by thus, and one day Kṛṣṇa and his
companions with their cattle went to the top of
Govardhana. Brahmā was alarmed to find Kṛṣṇa with
the artificially created Gopālas and the cattle, and
while he was looking at them the colour of all of them
began changing and within minutes they put on the
form of Viṣṇu. Moreover, he saw another Brahmā and
Brahmaloka. Upset and alarmed by the whole
phenomenon he sang the praises of Mahāviṣṇu at which
his illusion was lifted and he saw the actual Kṛṣṇa, the
Gopālas and the cattle.
<div n="NI"/>(11) {%Dhenukāsura killed.%} There lived in the Kadalī forest
on the banks of the Kālindī an Asura called Dhenuka
with his followers. The forest was thick with palm trees.
<div n="NI"/>Out of fear of the Asura nobody dared to travel in the
forest. Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadra having heard the
story about Dhenuka one day went to the forest with
their companions. Balabhadra shook down a lot of the
palm fruits, the Gopālas loudly cheered him. The
Asura rushed forth challenging them when Kṛṣṇa and
Balabhadra thrashed him to death.
<div n="NI"/>(12) {%Suppressed Kāliya.%} There lived in Kālindī a fierce
serpent called Kāliya with his wife and relations. The
trees on the banks of the river were withered and had
dried up on account of the poisonous breath emitted by
the serpent. One day the Gopālas and their cattle drank
water in the Kālindī and fell down dead. Then Kṛṣṇa
climbed a tree on the banks of the river and jumped
into its waters and Kāliya rushed forward to him with
his hoods spread out. Kṛṣṇa stepped on the hoods and
danced thereon. Kāliya vomited blood, got exhausted
and prayed to Kṛṣṇa for mercy. At the instance of
Kṛṣṇa the serpent with its family emigrated to the
Ramaṇaka island. (See under Kāliya).
<div n="NI"/>(13) {%Kṛṣṇa swallows fire.%} When Kṛṣṇa came out of the
waters after having suppressed Kāliya and taking with
him the gem presented by Kāliya, the Gopālas covered
Kṛṣṇa with embraces. People of Ambāḍi came to the
banks of the Kālindī looking out for the children. As the
sun had set by now the Yādavas spent the night there,
when a wild fire enveloped them, and they cried out
to Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa swallowed the entire fire. (Bhāgavata,
10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(14) {%Killed Pralamba.%} While the Gopālas were playing
once under the shade of a giant peepal tree called
Bhāṇḍīraka an Asura known as Pralamba joined their
games disguised as a Gopāla. Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadra
understood the trick. They made all the others take
the following pledge, i.e. that all of them would beat
one another, and the vanquished should carry about
the victor on his head. The beating began, and the
Gopa called Śrīdāman defeated Kṛṣṇa. Vṛṣabha defeat-
ed Bhadrasena and Balabhadra defeated Pralamba.
According to the pledge Śrī Kṛṣṇa carried on his
shoulders Śrīdāman, Bhadrasena carried Vṛṣabha and
Pralamba carried Balabhadra. But, Pralamba rose up
to the skies with Balabhadra, who broke the former's
head, and Pralamba fell down dead in his actual form
as an Asura.
<div n="NI"/>(15) {%Again in wild fire.%} The Gopālas were once again
caught in wild fire at the Muñja forest on the banks of
the Kālindī. They cried out in great fear when Kṛṣṇa
went to them and asked them to remain standing with
eyes closed. They obeyed him, and he swallowed the
fire as though it were nectar. The Gopālas were aston-
[Page423-a+ 65]
ished to find themselves safe when they opened their
eyes. (Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(16) {%Blessed the wives of Brahmins.%} Kṛṣṇa and his com-
panions one day travelled a long way along the banks
of the Kālindī. They felt very hungry and Kṛṣṇa advis-
ed them to request for food at brahmin houses. They
begged for food the wives of brahmins, and the
wives happy at Kṛṣṇa's presence there, came with food.
Kṛṣṇa blessed them. (Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(17) {%Theft of clothes.%} Kṛṣṇa once picked up the clothes
of the Gopa women who were bathing in the Kālindī and
climbed to the top of a tree with the clothes and play-
ed on his flute. The Gopa women came out of the river
and saluted Kṛṣṇa with folded hands. He then returned
the clothes to them. (Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(18) {%Mount Govardhana used as Umbrella.%} Indra is the
rain-God. The people of Ambāḍi used to perform yajña
every year in favour of Indra for rain-fall. Kṛṣṇa oppos-
ed the custom saying that Mount Govardhana was the
house-hold deity of the people of Ambāḍi and it was
enough for them to worship the mountain. The people
of Ambāḍi, therefore, offered the Yajña they had arrang-
ed that year for Indra to Govardhana. Angered at
this Indra let loose heavy rains on Ambāḍi. Kṛṣṇa up-
rooted and held Mount Govardhana like an umbrella
lest the people should suffer from the heavy rains, and they
took shelter under it. The rain did not stop even after
seven days. Yet, due to Kṛṣṇa's kindness the people did
not suffer any hardships. Beaten at his own game, Indra
sang the praises of Kṛṣṇa. Devasurabhi (cow of the
Devas) came and saluted Kṛṣṇa and anointed him, as
the Indra of the Gopālas. The Devas addressed him
‘Govinda’ meaning, he who protects the cattle. (Bhāga-
vata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(19) {%Nandagopa abducted by Varuṇa.%} Once after having
observed Ekādaśīvrata Nanda bathed in the river Kāl-
indī. At the instance of Varuṇa a Deva abducted and
took him to the abode of Varuṇa. People of Ambāḍi were
distressed at the disappearance of Nandagopa. Kṛṣṇa
and Balabhadra dived into the Kālindī and rose up at
Varuṇālaya. Varuṇa told them that he had abducted
Nandagopa so that he might see Viṣṇu in person, and
requested to be pardoned. Meanwhile the people of
Ambāḍi, who came to Kālindī saw all the worlds reflect-
ed in it. Kṛṣṇa and Rāma returned to Ambāḍi with
their father, Nandagopa. (Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(20) {%Rāsakrīḍā.%} At the advent of the spring the melody
of Kṛṣṇa's flute rendered the Gopa women love-lorn.
He went to Vṛndāvana with his flute, and all the
Gopa women, both married and unmarried followed
him. Kṛṣṇa made a futile attempt to send them back
to their houses. But, the love-sick Gopa women did not.
Suddenly Kṛṣṇa disappeared from among them, and the
Gopa women mad with love roamed about Vṛndāva-
na with Rādhā calling “O Kṛṣṇa! Kṛṣṇa!” Suddenly
Kṛṣṇa appeared before them. He entered the waters
of the Kālindī with them and satisfied them. Śrī Kṛṣṇa
thus explained Bhaktiyoga to the world. (Bhāgavata,
10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(21) {%Python swallowed Nandagopa.%} One day the Gopas
performed Maheśvara Pūjā (worship) in Devī forest,
and they spent the night without going to sleep on the
banks of the Kālindī. A python from somewhere began
swallowing Nandagopa. Though the Gopas tried their
best the snake did not loosen its grip on Nandagopa.
[Page423-b+ 63]
Then Kṛṣṇa gave it a kick and the snake transformed
itself into a Deva called Sudarśana. He was a Vidyā-
dhara, who had been converted into a python by the
curse of sage Aṅgiras. (See under Sudarśana).
<div n="NI"/>(22) {%Killed Ariṣṭāsura. (Vṛṣāsura).%} During this period
Ariṣṭāsura, a follower of Kaṃsa, came to Ambāḍi dis-
guised as an ox, and people got terror-stricken at the
sight of the fierce ox. Kṛṣṇa engaged himself in a duel
with the ox (Ariṣṭa) and killed it. (See under Ariṣṭa).
<div n="NI"/>(23) {%Killed Keśī.%} Kaṃsa then sent an Asura called Keśī
to Ambāḍi. He approached Kṛṣṇa in the guise of a
horse into whose mouth the latter thrust his hand, which
began growing in size with the result that the Asura
vomited blood and expired; Kṛṣṇa got the name
Keśava as he killed Keśī. (Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(24) {%Killed Vyomāsura.%} Vyomāsura, son of Mayāsura
was the last of the Asuras deputed by Kaṃsa to kill
Kṛṣṇa. He joined the company of the Gopas disguised
as a goat. Kṛṣṇa dragged him into a cave and killed
him there. (Bhāgavata 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Śrī Kṛṣṇa quits Ambāḍi.%} When all the attempts of
Kaṃsa to do away with Kṛṣṇa failed he resorted to
another trick. Kaṃsa invited Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadra,
feigning great affection, to witness the dhanur yajña
(worshipping the bow) being held at Mathurāpurī, the
capital of the country. The invitation was sent through
Akrūra, a great devotee of Kṛṣṇa. He went to Ambāḍi
with a chariot and delivered to Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadra
Kaṃsa's invitation to them for the fourteen days'dhanur
yajña. The Gopas and Gopīs shed tears at the prospect
of Kṛṣṇa leaving Ambāḍi. But, Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadra
took leave of them and started for Mathurāpurī in the
chariot brought by Akrūra. On their way to Mathurā
they bathed in the Kālindī and when they dived in its
waters Akrūra saw the Viśvarūpa (Cosmic form of
Kṛṣṇa). After the bath they continued their journey
when Akrūra informed Kṛṣṇa in secret, about all the
evil tactics of Kaṃsa and requested him to kill the
latter. (Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>10). {%Rāma and Kṛṣṇa in Mathurāpurī.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Rajakavadha (the washerman is slain).%} Rāma and
Kṛṣṇa duly reached Mathurāpurī, and in the evening
they went out for a stroll in the city to view its beauties
when they saw a washerman carrying the washed clothes
of Kaṃsa. They asked him for some of the clothes but
the washerman not only refused them the clothes but
also ridiculed them calling them cattle-breeders. Śrī
Kṛṣṇa thrashed the washerman on the spot and distri-
buted the clothes among the children who had gather-
ed there, himself wearing a yellow cloth from the stock
and giving a blue one to Balabhadra.
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Kañcukakāra (tailor) given salvation.%} Next, they
saw a tailor who used to stitch shirts, turbans etc. for
Kaṃsa. He presented costly shirts and turbans to Rāma
and Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa gave him salvation and distributed
the clothes to the Gopas with him.
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%Sudāman presents garlands.%} Then Kṛṣṇa and Rāma
entered the house of Sudāman who gave them each a
garland. Kṛṣṇa blessed him.
<div n="NI"/>(4) {%Straightened the hunch-back Trivakrā.%} Rāma and
Kṛṣṇa continued their walk when they saw a female
hunch-back coming opposite to them with a beautiful
vessel filled with aṅgarāga (fragrant things like sandal-
[Page424-a+ 65]
wood, musk etc. reduced into a paste to be smeared on
the body). She told them that she was the maid-in-
attendance of Kaṃsa; her name was Trivakrā and the
aṅgarāga in the vessel was for the use of Kaṃsa. She
felt pure love for Kṛṣṇa and gave him the aṅgarāga
along with the vessel. Rāma and Kṛṣṇa smeared their
bodies with it. Kṛṣṇa stepped on her feet and with his
right hand raised her chin upwards and she was cured
of her hunch. Her love for Kṛṣṇa knew no bounds and
she begged him to spend the night in her house. Kṛṣṇa
promised to oblige her on another occasion and conti-
nued the walk.
<div n="NI"/>(5) {%Kṛṣṇa broke the bow.%} Rāma and Kṛṣṇa continued
their walk into the Yajña hall of Kaṃsa. A big bow
was seen there, and Kṛṣṇa broke it with his left hand
before the guards could approach him. With the broken
pieces of the bow he killed the soldiers sent by Kaṃsa to
take him and Rāma into custody. They again continued
their walk. The sun set, and though they lay down to
sleep thoughts about the underhand dealings of Kaṃsa
kept them sleepless.
<div n="NI"/>(6) {%Kṛṣṇa killed the fierce elephant.%} That night Kṛṣṇa
dreamt many an inauspicious dream. The next morning
Kaṃsa set up an arena for pugilistic combats. Yādava
chiefs like Nandagopa, many other important persons in
Mathurā and Kaṃsa took their seats on the dais. Famous
pugilists like Cāṇūra, Muṣṭika, Kūṭa, Śala and Kosala
also entered the scene. Kaṃsa had stationed a fierce
elephant called Kuvalayāpīḍa on the way Rāma and
Kṛṣṇa had to take to enter the arena for pugilistic
competition. The mahout prompted the elephant to
catch hold of Kṛṣṇa, and in the fight that ensued with
the animal Kṛṣṇa killed it and gave one tusk of it to
Rāma. Kṛṣṇa beat the mahout also to death with the
tusk. After this they entered the scene.
<div n="NI"/>(7) {%Kaṃsa killed.%} The pugilistic competition started.
Cāṇūra fought against Kṛṣṇa and Muṣṭika against
Rāma and both Cāṇūra and Muṣṭika were killed. Rāma
and Kṛṣṇa killed three other famous pugilists too, who
confronted them following the death of Cāṇūra and
Muṣṭika. Thereupon the remaining pugilists ran away
into the forest. Kaṃsa, burning with anger, jumped up
from his seat roaring, “Annihilate the Gopālas, kill
Nandgopa, drown Ugrasena, the friend of our enemies,
in the Kālindī” etc. Responding to Kaṃsa's war-cry
Śrī Kṛṣṇa jumped into the former's sofa and pushed him
down. Kṛṣṇa jumped on to the back of Kaṃsa and
killed him. Balabhadra killed with his iron club the
eight brothers of Kaṃsa who rushed against Kṛṣṇa. After
consoling the women, who lamented over the death of
Kaṃsa and others Śrī Kṛṣṇa got their dead bodies duly
cremated. Rāma and Kṛṣṇa released Vasudeva and
Devakī and Ugrasena immediately from prison. Ugra-
sena was crowned King of Mathurā.
<div n="NI"/>(8) {%Farewell to the people of Ambāḍi.%} Rāma and Kṛṣṇa
saluted Nandagopa and Yaśodā, and entrusted to them
their clothes and bows for safe custody. Then saying
that they would return after strengthening the Yadu
dynasty, Rāma and Kṛṣṇa sent their parents and the
other Gopas home. (Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Education of Rāma and Kṛṣṇa.%}
(1) After bidding adieu to the people of Ambāḍi, Vasu-
deva, on the advice of sage Garga sent Rāma and
Kṛṣṇa for their studies to the Āśrama of the great sage
Sāndīpani. During their education at the Āśrama Kṛṣṇa
[Page424-b+ 65]
and Kucela became intimate friends. One day, at the in-
stance of the wife of their preceptor, Kṛṣṇa and Kucela
went into the forest to gather firewood. In the heavy
rain and storm that followed they lost their track and
wandered about in the forest. The next day the precep-
tor brought them back from the forest. Kṛṣṇa learned
the sixty-four arts and dhanurveda (science of archery)
at the feet of Sāndīpani. (Bhārata, Southern Text,
Page 802; Sabhā Parva, Chapter 38).
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Gurudakṣiṇā (Preceptor's fees).%} When Rāma and
Kṛṣṇa completed their studies they asked the precep-
tor as to what he wanted by way of tuition fee, and
the guru wanted to get back his son, who was, years
ago, drowned in Prabhāsa tīrtha. Accordingly
Rāma and Kṛṣṇa went in their chariot to Varuṇa at the
sea coast. Varuṇa told them that it was the Asura
called Pañcajana, who lived in the sea in the form of
a conch, who had killed their preceptor's son. Śrī
Kṛṣṇa entered the sea and killed the Asura. But, the
child was not to be seen inside the conch. Blowing
this conch, which in later years became famous as
Pāñcajanya, Rāma and Kṛṣṇa went to Yama's abode,
who on being told about the object of their visit return-
ed the child to Rāma and Kṛṣṇa. They presented the
child to their preceptor. He blessed them and they
returned to Mathurāpurī.
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Upto Kṛṣṇa's return to Dvārakā.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Message through Uddhava.%} Rāma and Kṛṣṇa who
returned to Mathurāpurī after their studies at Sāndī-
pani's Āśrama thought about the people of Ambāḍi.
It was a long time since they had heard about them. So
Kṛṣṇa sent a massage to Ambāḍi by his minis-
ter Uddhava. After duly delivering the message
Uddhava stayed at Ambāḍi four or five months after
which he returned to Mathurā with the presents given
to Kṛṣṇa by Nandagopa, Yaśodā and the other Gopas.
(2) {%Visited Trivakrā.%} Kṛṣṇa had promised to visit the
house of Trivakrā at the time he cured her of her
hunch, and she had been for long awaiting Kṛṣṇa. But
only now he got the opportunity to fulfil his promise.
He accepted her hospitality at her house and thus
ended her grief.
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%Interested himself in the Pāṇḍavas.%} By this time
Pāṇḍu had died. The Pāṇḍavas and Kuntī, sister of
Kṛṣṇa's father were living at Hastināpura along with
the Kauravas. They were victims to all sorts of miseries.
Hearing about the sad plight of the Pāṇḍavas Kṛṣṇa
deputed Akrūra to Hastināpura to enquire about them.
Kuntīdevī, with tears in her eyes, told Akrūra about
the injustice being done against the Pāṇḍavas by the
Kauravas and the continuous attempts being made to kill
Bhīma. Akrūra visited important persons like Vidura,
Dhṛtarāṣṭra etc. Akrūra exhorted Dhṛtarāṣṭra, who had
succeeded Pāṇḍu as King, to mete out equal justice to
Kauravas as well as to the Pāṇḍavas. Akrūra returned
to Mathurā and gave a report to Kṛṣṇa about his visit
to the Pāṇḍavas.
<div n="NI"/>(4) {%The Jarāsandha war.%} Asti and Prāpti, wives of
Kaṃsa complained about the killing of their husband
by Kṛṣṇa to their father Jarāsandha, King of Magadha.
Jarāsandha, aided by such famous Kings as Sālva,
Kaliṅga, Cedirāja, Dantavaktra and Śiśupāla besieged
Mathurāpurī with a big army. Yādava leaders like
Kṛṣṇa, Balabhadra, Uddhava, Akrūra and Kṛtavarman
met the enemies in battle in which many kings got
[Page425-a+ 64]
killed. Balabhadra met Jarāsandha in duel, but let him
off on the request of Kṛṣṇa. But, Jarāsandha, supported
by Bāṇāsura and others besieged Mathurā again and
again. When Balabhadra attempted to kill Jarāsandha,
a celestial voice declared that it was not possible for
the former to kill Jarāsandha, and the war, therefore,
ended for the time being.
<div n="NI"/>(5) {%Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadra meet Paraśurāma.%} The conti-
nuous war with Jarāsandha reduced the financial re-
sources of the Yādavas and to replenish their treasury
Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadra started for mount Gomantaka
the repository of gems and on their way they saw
Paraśurāma engaged in penance under a peepal tree.
Paraśurāma told them that there was a kingdom at the
foot of the Gomantaka called Karavīra ruled by King
Sṛgālavāsudeva and advised them to kill him and collect
enough money and gems. Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadra did
so and reached Pravarṣaṇagiri with money and gems so
collected. There Garuḍa brought back to Kṛṣṇa his
crown which had been, sometime back, stolen away by
Bāṇāsura. Kṛṣṇa and Rāma returned to Mathurāpurī.
Since Sṛgālavāsudeva had been killed by Kṛṣṇa and
Rāma, Jarāsandha attacked Mathurāpurī again, for the
eighteenth time. Though during all the wars Jarāsandha
was defeated, by that time the Yādava power had been
weakened much and so Kṛṣṇa ultimately decided to
leave Mathurā and found another kingdom somewhere
else. Kṛṣṇa had two reasons to come to this decision.
Firstly, Jarāsandha was the father-in-law of his uncle
Kaṃsa. Next, it was Jarāsandha's object to conquer
Mathurāpurī for Kaṃsa's sons. Taking into considera-
tion the above two objects of Jarāsandha, Kṛṣṇa and
Rāma voluntarily quitted Mathurā with the Yādavas
and went and lived in the city built for them by Viśva-
karman on an island called Dvārakā in the western sea.
(See under Kuśasthalī). (Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>13) {%Kṛṣṇa killed Kālayavana.%} King Kālayavana wanted
to conquer Mathurāpurī for which purpose he performed
penance and secured from Śiva the boon that none of
the Yādavas would be able to kill him. Kṛṣṇa had
shifted to Dvārakā, somewhat dejected by the thought
that Kālayavana could not be killed because of the
protection accorded by Śiva's boon.
<div n="NI"/>Another thing also happened at this juncture. King
Mucukunda, son of Māndhātā had on the request of
Indra gone to Devaloka and defeated the Asuras in
war. Indra asked him to choose his reward for this
service and Mucukunda wanted to be shown a place
for him to sleep as he had not slept for a long time.
Indra, accordingly showed him a cave on earth and
told him that he who disturbed him in sleep would be
reduced to ashes by his very look. Mucukunda went to
sleep in that cave.
<div n="NI"/>Kālayavana approached Kṛṣṇa to kill him and the
latter, pretending to be in fear of Kālayavana, ran
before him. Kālayavana followed Kṛṣṇa, who entered
the cave where Mucukunda was sleeping and he followed
Kṛṣṇa into the cave also. Kālayavana, mistaking
Mucukunda for Kṛṣṇa, kicked him violently whereupon
he jumped up from sleep and looked at Kālayavana,
who was reduced to ashes. Then Kṛṣṇa appeared before
Mucukunda. who praised the former. On the advice of
Kṛṣṇa he performed penance at Badarikāśrama and
attained salvation. (Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
[Page425-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>14) {%Śrī Kṛṣṇa escaped from fire.%} Balabhadra and Kṛṣṇa
started for Dvārakā carrying all the riches of Kālaya-
vana. They met Jarāsandha on their way and took to
their heels. Jarāsandha followed them to the heights of
Mount Pravarṣaṇa where they disappeared. Jarāsandha
set fire to the four sides of the mountain when Rāma
and Kṛṣṇa escaped secretly from the fire to Dvārakā.
Jarāsandha returned to Magadha believing that both
his antagonists were burned to death. (Bhāgavata, 10th
Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>15) {%Wedding of Rāma and Kṛṣṇa.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Balabhadra-Revatī.%} Balabhadra married Revatī,
daughter of King Ānarta of Kuśasthalī, former name
of Dvārakā.
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Kṛṣṇa-Rukmiṇī.%} King Bhīṣmaka of Vidarbha had
five sons the eldest of whom was Rukmī. His sixth
child was a daughter and she was named Rukmiṇī.
Stories about Kṛṣṇa kindled in Rukmiṇī love for him.
Rukmī, who hated Kṛṣṇa, wanted to give his sister in
marriage to Śiśupāla. Rukmiṇī sent through a brahmin
a message about the affair to Dvārakā. On the day of
Rukmiṇī's Svayaṃvara Rāma and Kṛṣṇa also went to
Kuṇḍinapurī, capital of Vidarbha. and Kṛṣṇa. in the
presence of all Kings, carried Rukmiṇī away in his
chariot. The Kings who, under the leadership of
Rukmī, attacked Kṛṣṇa were routed. A son called
Pradyumna was born to Kṛṣṇa by Rukmiṇī. (See under
Pradyumna).
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%Kṛṣṇa-Jāmbavatī.%} Prasena, brother of the Yādava
King Satrājit, went ahunting wearing on him the gem
called Syamantaka presented to the latter by the Sun-
god. Jāmbavān saw a lion carrying off the gem after
killing Prasena. He killed the lion, recovered the gem
from it and gave it to his children to play with. A
rumour was spread that it was Kṛṣṇa who had killed
and stolen the gem. Kṛṣṇa searched for the gem in the
forest and found it out in the cave of Jāmbavān. In
the duel that ensued between Jāmbavān and Kṛṣṇa
the former was defeated. He recognised Kṛṣṇa to be
the Lord, and presented Syamantaka and also his
daughter Jāmbavatī to Kṛṣṇa and Jāmbavatī thus
became Kṛṣṇa's wife. (See under Syamantaka).
<div n="NI"/>(4) {%Śrī Kṛṣṇa-Satyabhāmā.%} Śrī Kṛṣṇa returned Syaman-
taka to Satrājit and he, in return, gave his daughter
Satyabhāmā in marriage to Kṛṣṇa. Though Syaman-
taka was given to Kṛṣṇa by way of dowry he did not
accept it. (Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(5) {%Śrī Kṛṣṇa-Kālindī.%} The happy news that the Pāṇḍa-
vas had escaped from the lac palace and were living at
Khāṇḍavaprastha took some time to reach Kṛṣṇa, who
had been pained to know that they were burned to
death in the palace. As soon as Kṛṣṇa knew that the
Pāṇḍavas were safe at Khāṇḍavaprastha he went to
them along with Yādava chiefs like Sātyaki and others.
It was then that the fire-god Vahni, requested Arjuna
for the Khāṇḍava forest for his food and Arjuna con-
sented to it. It was Kṛṣṇa who drove Arjuna's chariot
in his fight with Indra at the burning of the forest by
Agnideva. (See under Khāṇḍavadāha). Arjuna saved
Maya from the Khāṇḍava fire and Maya, in return for
the kindness, built a palace for the Pāṇḍavas at Indra-
prastha. Kṛṣṇa also lived there for a few days. One
day while Kṛṣṇa was strolling on the banks of the
Kālindī in the company of Arjuna they saw a woman,
who told them that her name was Kālindī and that
[Page426-a+ 65]
she would marry none but Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa then took her
as his wife. (See under Kālindī). After staying at
Indraprastha for three or four months Kṛṣṇa returned
to Dvārakā with Kālindī. (Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>(6) {%Śrī Kṛṣṇa-Mitravindā.%} The King of Avantī had
married Rājādhidevī, sister of Kṛṣṇa's father and they
had two sons called Vinda and Anuvinda and a
daughter Mitravindā, who had fixed in her mind
Kṛṣṇa as her husband. Kṛṣṇa, who was present at her
Svayaṃvara carried her off on his chariot to Dvārakā.
<div n="NI"/>(7) {%Śrī Kṛṣṇa-Satyā.%} King Nagnajit of Kosala, father of
Satyā, had seven oxen like elephants in strength. The
King proclaimed that his daughter would be married
to the person who would tie down the oxen. Various
Kings attempted the task but failed. Ultimately
Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa went to Kosala and Kṛṣṇa assumed
seven forms and tied down the oxen with cords. The
seven oxen at once fell down. Kṛṣṇa took Satyā for his
wife.
<div n="NI"/>(8) {%Śrī Kṛṣṇa-Kaikeyī (Bhadrā).%} Kṛṣṇa married
Kaikeyī, the daughter of Śrutakīrti, sister of Kṛṣṇa's
father.
<div n="NI"/>(9) {%Śrī Kṛṣṇa-Lakṣmaṇā.%} Lakṣmaṇā, daughter of King
of Madra chose Kṛṣṇa at her Svayaṃvara and she
became Kṛṣṇa's wife.
<div n="NI"/>(10) {%Kṛṣṇa-16000 women.%} Brahmā had given the boon
to the 16000 daughters of Narakāsura in their previous
birth that Viṣṇu would marry them in their next birth.
While even the Devas were suffering on account of
Narakāsura, Śrī Kṛṣṇa along with Satyabhāmā mounted
Garuḍa, went to Prāgjyotiṣa, the kingdom of
Narakāsura, defeated him in fight and released his
16000 daughters from captivity. He returned with
them to Dvārakā, assumed the guise of 16000 men and
married those 16000 girls. He built a palace for each
of his 16000 wives. (For details see under Narakāsura).
<div n="NI"/>16) {%Kṛṣṇa's%} 16008 {%wives.%} The eight women, i.e.
Rukmiṇī, Jāmbavatī, Satyabhāmā, Kālindī, Mitra-
vindā, Satyā, Kaikeyī (Bhadrā) Lakṣmaṇā and the 16000
daughters of Narakāsura constituted Kṛṣṇa's harem.
(The 16000 daughters of Narakāsura are not mentioned
by name in the Purāṇas). (See under Sudattā and
Ketumān IV.)
<div n="NI"/>17) {%Gave Salvation to Ghaṇṭākarṇas.%} Ghaṇṭa and
Karṇa were two demon brothers. Kṛṣṇa met them at
Badarikāśrama where he had gone after his marriage
with Rukmiṇī, to perform penance to Śiva for a child.
Kṛṣṇa offered salvation to the two demon brothers,
Ghaṇṭa and Karṇa.

Narakāsura was having his own ways on the earth and
when he took away by force Indra's royal umbrella
and the ear-rings of Aditi, the Devamātā, Indra sought
Kṛṣṇa's help to suppress the Asura. Kṛṣṇa along with
Satyabhāmā, mounted Garuḍa, went and killed the
Asura and restored the royal umbrella to Indra and
the ear-rings to Aditi. On their way back home Kṛṣṇa,
as desired by Satyabhāmā, plucked by its roots the
Pārijāta from Devaloka at which Indra fought Kṛṣṇa,
but got defeated. The Pārijāta was brought to Dvārakā
and planted in front of Satyabhāmā's palace. It is
stated that Pārijāta was thus brought and planted by
[Page426-b+ 64]
Kṛṣṇa to alleviate the grief caused to Satyabhāmā by
the return by Kṛṣṇa of Syamantaka to Satrājit.
(Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>22) {%Kṛṣṇa's sons and grand-children.%} Ten sons were born

<div n="NI"/>23) {%Kṛṣṇa tested Rukmiṇī%} While Śrī Kṛṣṇa was once
having a chat with Rukmiṇī he wanted to test her
love for him. So he told her that he was penniless and
helpless and was hiding from his enemies there at
Dvārakā and that he would only be really glad if she

sandha. (See under Jarāsandha).
<div n="NI"/>(4) He crowned Sahadeva, son of Jarāsandha, as

(Udyoga Parva, Chapter 1).
<div n="NI"/>31) {%Tested by Nārada.%} Nārada wanted to know how

with half the kingdom to the Pāṇḍavas, who had
returned from their exile in the forest. Both the
sides began preparations for war. Duryodhana went to
Dvārakā to invite Kṛṣṇa to his side, and seeing him
at a distance Kṛṣṇa feigned sleep and lay down there.
Duryodhana occupied a stool at the head of Kṛṣṇa's
bed. Arjuna, who also came to seek his help, stood
with folded hands at Kṛṣṇa's feet. It was Arjuna
whom Kṛṣṇa first saw on waking up. But Duryodhana
told him that it was he who had come first. Kṛṣṇa
was in a fix, and he had to promise to help both the
sides. He promised his entire army to one side and his
personal help, himself without any weapons with him,
to the other side, and Arjuna was asked to make his
choice first as he was younger than Duryodhana.
Arjuna chose Kṛṣṇa without arms and Duryodhana

charioteer.
<div n="NI"/>35) {%As messenger of peace in Kaurava assembly.%} Dharma-
putra requested Kṛṣṇa to find out means to avoid war
somehow or other and Kṛṣṇa sent a message to Dhṛtarā-
ṣṭra through Sañjaya but nothing came out of it. Ultima-
tely Kṛṣṇa himself decided to visit the Kauravas for which
purpose he went first to Dvārakā in his chariot with
Sātyaki. On his way Kṛṣṇa held talks with many a
great sage. From Dvārakā he returned to Hastināpura
where he visited and consoled Kuntī at Vidura's house.
He had his supper also there. The next day he attended
Duryodhana's court and strongly pleaded for the
Pāṇḍavas. But Duryodhana and others ridiculed him
and even attempted to take him captive. Śrī Kṛṣṇa at
[Page427-b+ 64]
once exhibited his Viśva-rūpa (Cosmic form). The
Kauravas were frightened to witness Brahmā on
Kṛṣṇa's forehead, Śiva on his chest, Āditya-Vasu-
Rudras in his mouth etc. Śrī Kṛṣṇa granted the blind
Dhṛtarāṣṭra divine eyes to see this Viśvarūpa and he
sang the praise of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa returned to the
Pāṇḍavas after advising Karṇa to fight on the Pāṇḍava
side in the impending war. (Udyoga Parva).
<div n="NI"/>36) {%Kṛṣṇa in the great war.%} The parts Kṛṣṇa played
during the Kuru-Pāṇḍava war are briefly given below.
<div n="NI"/>(1) The Kaurava and the Pāṇḍava armies were gather-
ed at Kurukṣetra in full battle array and Arjuna, at
the sight of the thousands of relations in the opposite
camp, became a prey to a great delusion and sat down.
Kṛṣṇa then enthused him to fight by giving him
advice, which came later to be known as the great
Gītā. The Gītā contains the Sāṅkhya, Yoga, the
characteristics of the wise people and the unwise, des-
cription about yajñas, greatness of knowledge, chara-
cteristics of Sāṃkhya and niṣkāmakarma, yogins,
jñānayoga etc. (Bhīṣma Parva, Chapters 26-42).
<div n="NI"/>(2) At the commencement of the battle, Kṛṣṇa blew
aloud his conch Pāñcajanya. (Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter
25, Verse 15).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Kṛṣṇa rushed forward with his Cakrāyudha to
kill Bhīṣma, who then praised Kṛṣṇa. (Bhīṣma Parva,
Chapter 65).
<div n="NI"/>(4) He prompted Arjuna to kill Bhīṣma. (Bhīṣma Parva,
Chapter 106, Verse 33).
<div n="NI"/>(5) He received on his chest the Vaiṣṇavāstra shot by
Bhagadatta against Arjuna. (Droṇa Parva, Chapter 29,
Verse 13).
<div n="NI"/>(6) Consoled Arjuna, who was lamenting over the
death of Abhimanyu. (Droṇa Parva, Chapter 72).
<div n="NI"/>(7) Consoled Subhadrā, who was sunk in sorrow at
the loss of her son. (Droṇa Parva, Chapter 77).
<div n="NI"/>(8) Consoled the crying Pāñcālī and Uttarā. (Droṇa
Parva, Chapter 78).
<div n="NI"/>(9) Took Arjuna in a dream to Śiva and got Śiva's
blessing for him. (Droṇa Parva, Chapter 80).
<div n="NI"/>(10) He looked after the horses in the battle-field.
Droṇa Parva, Chapter 100).
<div n="NI"/>(11) Prompted Arjuna to kill Duryodhana. (Droṇa
Parva, Chapter 102).
<div n="NI"/>(12) Kṛṣṇa created illusory darkness and prompted
Arjuna to kill Jayadratha. (See under Jayadratha).
<div n="NI"/>(13) He lifted the darkness after Jayadratha was killed
by Arjuna. (Droṇa Parva, Chapter 146).
<div n="NI"/>(14) As it was not proper for Arjuna and Karṇa to be
fighting with each other at mid-night he deputed
Ghaṭotkaca to fight Karṇa. (Droṇa Parva, Chapter
173).
<div n="NI"/>(15) He consoled Dharmaputra, who was grieving
over the death of Ghaṭotkaca. (Droṇa Parva, Chapter
153).
<div n="NI"/>(16) He prompted Arjuna to kill Karṇa. (Karṇa
Parva, Chapter 60).
<div n="NI"/>(17) Withdrew Arjuna from confrontation with Karṇa
on the pretext of attending to Dharmaputra, who had
been wounded. (Karṇa Parva, Chapter 64).
<div n="NI"/>(18) A sudden dispute arose between Dharmaputra and
Arjuna, who drew his sword to kill the former. And
Kṛṣṇa reconciled them by relating the story of Vyādha
and Kauśika (For the story see under Valāka).
[Page428-a+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>(19) Arjuna got ready to commit suicide: Kṛṣṇa
dissuaded him from the attempt. (Karṇa Parva,
Chapter 70).
<div n="NI"/>(20) Kṛṣṇa again prompted Arjuna to kill Karṇa.
<div n="NI"/>(21) In the fierce battle that ensued between Arjuna
and Karṇa, Kṛṣṇa pressed down the platform of the
chariot when the latter shot the nāgāstra (the serpent
arrow). The arrow flew off with Arjuna's crown.
(Karṇa Parva, Chapter 90).
<div n="NI"/>(22) Arjuna killed Karṇa after which Kṛṣṇa prompted
Dharmaputra to kill Śalya. (Śalya Parva, Chapter 7).
<div n="NI"/>(23) Kṛṣṇa prompted Bhīma to kill Duryodhana in an
illusory battle. (Śalya Parva, Chapter 58).
<div n="NI"/>(24) As requested by Yudhiṣṭhira Kṛṣṇa left the
battle-field for Hastināpura and returned after con-
soling Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Gāndhārī. (Śalya Parva,
Chapter 62).
<div n="NI"/>(25) Kṛṣṇa cursed Aśvatthāmā who released arrows
against pregnant women. (See under Aśvatthāmā).
<div n="NI"/>(26) Asked Bhīṣma to instruct Yudhiṣṭhira on dharma
(righteousness). (Śānti Parva, Chapter 51).
<div n="NI"/>(27) He granted the boon to Bhīṣma lying on the bed of
arrows that he would not feel hunger and thirst and
that his intellect would function powerfully as long as
he was discoursing on dharma. (Śānti Parva, Chapter
52).
<div n="NI"/>(28) He related to Arjuna the root meaning of his
various names. (Śānti Parva, Chapter 341).
<div n="NI"/>(29) He explained to sages and Bhūmidevī some pro-
found doctrines about God and the world. (Anuśāsana
Parva, Chapter 167).
<div n="NI"/>(30) He gave permission to Bhīṣma to die. (Anuśāsana
Parva, Chapter 167).
<div n="NI"/>(31) Consoled Gaṅgādevī who grieved over the death
of Bhīṣma. (Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 168).
<div n="NI"/>(32) He once again revealed the doctrine of the Gītā
in the form of discussions between Siddhamaharṣis and
Kaśyapa. (Āśramavāsika Parva, Chapter 16).
<div n="NI"/>(33) After the great war was over he went to Dvārakā
with Subhadrā and Sātyaki with the consent of Yudhiṣ-
ṭhira. (Āśramavāsika Parva, Chapter 57, Verses 54-58).
<div n="NI"/>37) {%Śrī Kṛṣṇa again at Dvārakā.%} When Kṛṣṇa returned to
Dvārakā, Sage Uttaṅka visited him. The sage was told
details about the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas by Kṛṣṇa.
He detailed to the sage spiritual principles too and
showed him his Viśvarūpa (Cosmic form). Kṛṣṇa parti-
cipated in festival held by the Yādavas on the Raivata
mountain. Afterwards when he went to Dvārakā he
told his father Vasudeva details about the war. He him-
self performed the obsequies of Abhimanyu. (Aśvamedha
Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(38) {%Killed Haṃsaḍibhakas.%} See under Ḍibhaka.
<div n="NI"/>(39) {%Kṛṣṇa brought back Parīkṣit to life.%} Kṛṣṇa again
went to Hastināpura. There Uttarā, wife of Abhimanyu,
delivered, but the child was born dead as the arrow
of Aśvatthāmā had hit her womb. Kṛṣṇa brought the
dead child back to life on the request of Kuntī. It was
this child, who became later famous as Parīkṣit. (Aśva-
medha Parva, Chapter 66).
<div n="NI"/>(40) {%The evening of Kṛṣṇa's life.%}
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%The curse of Gāndhārī.%} Most of the heroes and
distinguished archers like Duryodhana had been killed
in the great war, and Gāndhārī overwhelmed with grief
and anger at the death of her sons lamented over them
[Page428-b+ 65]
loudly. She realised that Kṛṣṇa was the cause of all
the destruction and cursed him as follows:—
“If I have gained any powers by my loyal and devout
service to my husband, O! Kṛṣṇa I curse you on the
strength of that power. Since you forsook relations like
the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas who quarrelled with
each other, you also will have to witness the killing of
relations. Thirtysix years from today your relations,
ministers and sons will be killed, and you too will be
killed by a hunter in the forest. Your women-folk also
will cry as we women cry now.” (Strī Parva, Chapter
25).
<div n="NI"/>The curse of Gāndhārī that the Yādava dynasty would
be annihilated after thirtysix years was fulfilled. In the
thirty-sixth year another curse also befell the dynasty
which contributed further to its annihilation.
<div n="NI"/>(2) {%Curse of the sages.%} The sages Viśvāmitra, Kaṇva
and Nārada came to Dvārakā once. Some Yādavas
brought Sāmba dressed as a pregnant woman before the
sages and asked them derisively what child, whether
male or female, would Sāmba give birth to. Angry at
this insult, the sages said that the ‘pregnant woman’
would deliver an iron rod, which would become instru-
mental for the destruction of the Yādava dynasty. Kṛṣṇa
who was told about the curse said that it was as it was
destined to be. Next day Sāmba delivered an iron rod.
The Yādavas filed it into powder and threw the
powder into the sea. Śrī Kṛṣṇa enforced prohibition of
liquors in Dvārakā with the object of avoiding any
untoward incidents in Dvārakā. It was declared that
those who produced liquor would be hanged to death
along with their families. (Mausala Parva, Chapter 1).
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%Evil omens.%} Signs of the destruction of the Yādavas
began appearing. Agents of Kāla visited house after
house. Rats multiplied in numbers everywhere in the
land, and they began gnawing the nails and hairs of
people enjoying sleep. Sheep howled like jackals. Asses
were born from cows and cats from mules. Dogs coha-
bited with rats. The Cakrāyudha (Discus) given to
Kṛṣṇa by Agnideva at the time of Khāṇḍavadāha dis-
appeared into the sky while the Yādavas were looking
on. Thus symptoms of an all-round destruction were
witnessed.
<div n="NI"/>(4) {%Destruction of the rādavas.%} Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Balabhadra,
Uddhava and others were about to go on a pilgrimage,
and the Yadus, the Vṛṣṇis and the Andhakas began
manufacturing and drinking liquor. They also began to
quarrel with one another. The powder of the iron rod
thrown into the sea was washed ashore and it grew up
like arrow-like grass. The Yādavas fought with one
another and many were killed. Kṛṣṇa got terribly angry
at the death of Sātyaki, Pradyumna and others. He
plucked a handful of grass and it transformed itself into
an iron rod with which he beat to death those around
him. Then all the people plucked up the grass which
turned into iron rods. They fought amongst themselves
with the iron rods and all of them got killed.
<div n="NI"/>(5) {%Death of Rāma and Kṛṣṇa.%} During this period Bala-
bhadra went and seated himself under a tree in deep
meditation. Kṛṣṇa stood near him. Dāruka and Babhru
also arrived there. Kṛṣṇa deputed Dāruka to Hastinā-
pura to inform Arjuna about the annihilation of the
Yādava race. Then Kṛṣṇa went to the palace and con-
soled the women-folk there. When he told them that
Arjuna would come and take care of them, his wives
[Page429-a+ 64]
shed tears. Kṛṣṇa then took leave of Vasudeva and
returned to Balabhadra. Kṛṣṇa saw even at a distance
a white serpent coming out of Balabhadra's mouth
and moving away to Pātāla through the sea. The ser-
pent which was the soul of Balabhadra was duly receiv-
ed by the prominent Nāgas in Pātāla. Kṛṣṇa roamed
about the forest for some time and then lay down on
the ground immersed in Yoga with his feet raised up.
An Asura called Jara, who saw Kṛṣṇa's raised feet from
a distance mistook the same for a deer and shot it with
his arrows. Kṛṣṇa expired at once and rose up in the
guise of Viṣṇu to Vaikuṇṭha. (Mausala Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(6) {%Reason for Kṛṣṇa's foot being hit by arrow.%} Durvāsas
once went to Dvārakā and enquired who was there to
put him up as a guest. Kṛṣṇa invited him to his palace
and treated him as a very honoured guest. He began
creating trouble there by breaking vessels, eating only
very sparsely at times but eating all that he saw at
other times. Kṛṣṇa and Rukmiṇī put up with the
vagaries of the sage quite patiently. One day the sage
expressed a desire to taste pudding, and accordingly
Kṛṣṇa and Rukmiṇī cooked it and served it to the sage.
After tasting some pudding he asked Kṛṣṇa to smear
his whole body with the balance of it and Kṛṣṇa did so
except the bottom of his feet. The sage asked him why
he did not smear the nether surface of his feet with
the pudding to which Kṛṣṇa humbly answered that he
did not like doing so. Durvāsas smeared Rukmiṇī's
body with what remained of the pudding. He yoked
Rukmiṇī to the chariot and rode off swiftly in it. On
the way he whipped Rukmiṇī. Kṛṣṇa ran after the
chariot so that he might be of service to the sage.
After he had gone some distance the sage jumped out
of the chariot and ran through the forest. Ultimately
he turned round to Kṛṣṇa and told him as follows:—
“Oh! Kṛṣṇa! I am pleased with your service. Let
Rukmiṇī have the first place among your wives. She will
not be affected by old age. And, you will never meet
with death by being hit at those parts of your body
which have been smeared with the pudding.”
<div n="NI"/>When Kṛṣṇa and Rukmiṇī returned to the palace the
vessels which Durvāsas had broken were found to be
in a more glittering condition than of old. Their welfare
and happiness were also increased. Kṛṣṇa died hit by
the arrow of the hunter on the lower surface of his feet
as he had not smeared that part of the body with the
pudding left over by Durvāsas. (Anuśāsana Parva,
Chapter 159), (There is another story to the effect that
Jara, the hunter, was Bāli (whom Śrī Rāma had killed)
reborn, and he killed Kṛṣṇa in retaliation for his former
death).
<div n="NI"/>(7) {%After Kṛṣṇa's death.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Arjuna came to Dvārakā and cremated Kṛṣṇa.
(Mausala Parva, Chapter 7, Verse 31).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) After his death Kṛṣṇa, lives in the guise of Nārā-
yaṇa in the divine sphere. (Svargārohaṇa Parva,
Chapter 5, Verses 24-26).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Anointed queens like Rukmiṇī and Jāmbavatī
and some other wives of Kṛṣṇa entered his funeral
pyre and ended their lives. (Mausala Parva, Chapter
7, Verses 73 and 74).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) While Arjuna was leading the remaining wives of
Kṛṣṇa away from Dvārakā forest-dwellers attacked
them on the way. But the women, to escape from their
[Page429-b+ 65]
clutches, ran off and jumped into the river Sarasvatī
and died in its waters. Their souls entered heaven
(Svargārohaṇa Parva, Chapter 6, Verse 25).
