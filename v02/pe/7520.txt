TĀRAKA II¦. Śiva Purāṇa mentions about a Tāraka,
son of the minister of Bhadrasena, a King of Kashmir.
This Tāraka was the rebirth of a he-fowl. Bhadrasena
had a son named Sudharmā. He was the rebirth of a
monkey. There is a story regarding how this fowl and
the monkey came to be born in Kashmir as above.
<div n="NI"/>Once in the village of Nanda there was a prostitute
named Mahānandā. Though she was a great devotee
of Śiva she was living the life of a prostitute for her
livelihood. She was having a monkey and a he-fowl
as pets. She would adorn the necks of her pets with
the rudrākṣa necklace (rosary) made of berry beads
favourite of Śiva and when she sang songs in praise of
Śiva those pets danced to the tune.
<div n="NI"/>One day a Vaiśya came there. He had a diamond Śiva
liṅga with him. Mahānandā felt a great fancy for that
and so promised the Vaiśya that if he gave her the
diamond liṅga she would remain a faithful wife to him
for three days. The Vaiśya agreed and the diamond
liṅga was kept in a very secure place That night when
both the Vaiśya and Mahānandā were sleeping tired
after a hectic amorous sport, the house got fire and the
diamond was burst into pieces. The Vaiśya greatly
griefstricken by the loss of the diamond, jumped into the
fire and committed suicide. Mahānandā faithful to the
promise that she would remain his wife for three days
started to jump into the fire and abandon her life. At
once Śiva appeared before her in person and said thus:
“Oh, Mahānandā, do not commit suicide. I came to
you disguised as a Vaiśya to test your devotion. You
can now ask of me any boon.”
<div n="NI"/>With tears of joy running down her cheeks she said
she wanted to live with Śiva. So Śiva carried her soul
to Kailāsa. Not only that, Śiva blessed the fowl and
monkey and said they would be born as devotees of Śiva
in their next birth and attain mokṣa at the end of their
life on earth. Accordingly the monkey and the fowl were
born in Kashmir as Sudharmā and Tāraka.
