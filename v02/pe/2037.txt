DHUNDHU I¦. A notorious Asura. He was the son of
the Madhu Kaiṭabhas.
<div n="NI"/>Brahmā was born in the lotus from the navel of Viṣṇu,
who was lying in meditation on the surface of water.
From the ear-wax of Viṣṇu two asuras—Madhu and
Kaiṭabha sprang up. They terrified Brahmā by sha-
king the stalk of the lotus. Brahmā became terribly
afraid of the asuras and ran about on the surface of
water. Hearing the cry of Brahmā Viṣṇu awoke, but
he could not defeat the asuras. Viṣṇu decided to
employ ‘Sāma’ (conciliation) the first expedient. The
arrogant demons ordered Viṣṇu to ask of them any
boon. Viṣṇu replied. “If it is so, you must be killed by
me.” They could not but give the boon. They agreed
to the request of Viṣṇu and said: “But we must be
killed in an atmosphere, which is not cloudy.” Viṣṇu
killed them when the atmosphere was clear.
<div n="NI"/>A son named Dhundhu had been born to Madhu and
Kaiṭabha. Because Viṣṇu had killed his fathers
Dhundhu decided to take revenge on Viṣṇu and the
Gods. With this idea in view Dhundhu began to do
penance in the sandy desert of Ujjālaka in Marudhanva.
Standing on one leg he did penance for thousands of
years. Then Brahmā appeared before him and gave the
boon that he would not be killed by Devas, Dānavas
(asuras), Gandharvas (Demi-gods), Rākṣasas (demons),
Yakṣas (paragods) and Uragas (serpents). Having got
this boon, he lived under sand in the desert of Ujjālaka.
His idea was to destroy the gods.
<div n="NI"/>A hermit named Uttaṅka had erected his hermitage in
another part of Marudhanva and began penance. By his
penance he made Viṣṇu appear before him and then
made a request that Dhundhu's activities be put a
stop to. Viṣṇu replied “Uttaṅka! Dhundhu has become
a curse to the three worlds. There is a king named
Kuvalāśva, born of the dynasty of Ikṣvāku. He will
kill Dhundhu.” Saying these words, Viṣṇu disappear-
ed.
<div n="NI"/>Uttaṅka went to the palace of Kuvalāśva and told
him what Viṣṇu had said. Kuvalāśva and his sons
went to the forest and killed Dhundhu in a fight.
From that day Kuvalāśva came to be known by the
[Page240-b+ 64]
name Dhundhumāra,
<F>1. Dhundhu was the son of Kaśyapa, born of Danu. It was to kill Dhundhu that Viṣṇu incarnated a Vāmana, Vāmanapurāna
Chapter 8.</F> which meant ‘the killer of
Dhundhu. (M.B. Vana Parva, 4 Chapters from 201).
