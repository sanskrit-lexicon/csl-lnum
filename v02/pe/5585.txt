RĀDHĀ I¦. Śrī Kṛṣṇa's dearest consort. Rādhā is consi-
dered to be one of the two forms of Lakṣmīdevī. When
Kṛṣṇa lived in Gokula as a man with two hands
Rādhā was his dearest consort. But when he lives in
Vaikuṇṭha as four-handed Viṣṇu, Lakṣmī is his dearest
[Page625-b+ 65]
consort. (Devī Bhāgavata 9, 1; Brahmavaivarta Purāṇa,
2, 49 and 56-57 and Ādi Parva Chapter 11).
<div n="NI"/>Different versions about the birth of Rādhā are given
in the Purāṇas, as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>(i) She was born in Gokula as daughter of Vṛṣabhānu
and Kalāvatī. (Brahmavaivarta Purāṇa, 2, 49; 35-42;
Nārada Purāṇa, 2. 81).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) She was got as Bhūmi-kanyā (earth-girl) when
King Vṛṣabhānu was preparing the ground to conduct
a Yajña. (Padma Purāṇa; Brahma Purāṇa 7).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) She was born from the left side of Kṛṣṇa. (Brahma-
vaivarta Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) At the time of Kṛṣṇa's birth Viṣṇu asked his
attendants to be born on earth. Accordingly Rādhā,
dear consort of Kṛṣṇa, took her birth in Gokula
under the star Jyeṣṭhā in the morning of Śuklāṣṭamī
day in Bhādrapada month. (Ādi Parva 11),
<div n="NI"/>(v) Kṛṣṇa once went with Virajā, the Gopī woman, to
the hall of enjoyment (rāsamaṇḍalam). Knowing about
it Rādhā followed them to the hall, but both of them
were not to be seen. On another occasion when Rādhā
found Virajā in the company of Kṛṣṇa and Sudāmā
she, in great anger, insulted Kṛṣṇa whereupon Sudāmā
cursed her to be born in human womb and experience the
pangs of separation from Kṛṣṇa. (Nārada Purāṇa 2. 8;
Brahmavaivarta Purāṇa. 2. 49) and Rādhā cursed him
in turn to be born in the dānava dynasty. It was on
account of this curse of Rādhā that Sudāmā was born
as the asura called Śaṅkhacūḍa. (Brahma Vaivarta
Purāṇa, 2. 4. 9. 34).
<div n="NI"/>(vi) Rādhā is considered to be one of the five forces
which help Viṣṇu in the process of creation. (Devī
Bhāgavata 9. 1; Nārada Purāṇa 2. 81).
<div n="NI"/>(vii) Rādhā is the mental power of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. (For
details see under Pañcaprāṇas).
