RUKMĪ¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} King of the Province Bhoja-
kaṭa in the country of Vidarbha. It is stated in Mahā-
bhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 67, Stanza 62, that this
Rukmī was born from a portion of the Asura named
Krodhavaśa.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} Father of Rukmī was the king Bhīṣmaka.
Two children were born to Bhīṣmaka, named Rukmī
and Rukmiṇī. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 31, Stanza
62).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Getting a bow.%} Śrī Kṛṣṇa took Rukmī's sister
Rukmiṇī by force and married her. Rukmī did not like
this and so he confronted Śrī Kṛṣṇa. In the contest Śrī
Kṛṣṇa reviled him. Rukmī got angry at this and went to
Kailāsa and did penance before Śiva. Śiva appeared
before him after three years, and gave him a bow for
destroying the enemies. Śiva told him that it would be
broken, only if it was used against Mahāviṣṇu. After
getting this bow he returned to Bhojakaṭa and lived
there.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The details regarding Rukmī, given in the Mahābhārata.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Rukmī accepted the suzerainty of Sahadeva at the
time of his regional conquest. (M.B. Sabhā Parva,
Chapter 21, Stanza 62).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Rukmī paid tribute to Karṇa at the time of his
regional conquest. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 254,
Stanza 14).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) The Pāṇḍavas had sent invitation to Rukmī for the
Bhārata-battle. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 11,
Stanza 16).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Bhīṣmaka, the father of Rukmī, was known
by the name ‘Hiraṇyaromā’ also. Rukmī became
famous throughout all the countries. He accepted
Druma, a famous Kimpuruṣa (Kinnara) as his teacher
in archery. Druma presented him with a bow called
Vijaya. This Vijaya was on a par with the Gāṇḍīva.
Rukmī fought with Śrī Kṛṣṇa and was defeated. The
place at which he was defeated by Śrī Kṛṣṇa is known
as Bhojakaṭa.
<div n="NI"/>After having been defeated by Śrī Kṛṣṇa, a thought
arose in the mind of Rukmī to keep amity and concord
with Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Knowing this, the Pāṇḍavas invited
Rukmī to their palace. He promised his help if ever
Arjuna feared to do battle. At this Arjuna laughed and
said that he was not in need of any help. After this
Rukmī went to Duryodhana and promised to help him.
But Duryodhana also rejected his help. (M.B. Udyoga
Parva, Chapter 158).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Death of Rukmī.%} Discontented with everybody, Rukmī
lived in Bhojakaṭa, having no contact with any body.
During this period the king of Kaliṅga once approached
Rukmī and advised him to challenge Balabhadrarāma
for a game of dice. The challenge was made knowing
that Balabhadra was not a good player. Knowing that
to reject a challenge was not honourable, Balabhadra
went to play the game. Rukmī won the first round of
game. Staking everything, the second round of the
game began and Balabhadra won the game. But
Rukmī and the king of Kaliṅga did not accept the
victory. All the kings who witnessed the game sided
with Rukmī. Instantly an ethereal voice said “Balabha-
drarāma has won the game.” The friends of Rukmī
did not accept the ethereal voice. They began to create
a tumult in the hall. Balabhadrarāma who became
furious at this ridicule took a pestle of iron and killed
[Page657-a+ 64]
Rukmī with one blow. The rest of the kings fled from
the place. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 10).
