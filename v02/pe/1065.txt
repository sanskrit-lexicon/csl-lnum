BHARATA III¦. A son of Ṛṣabha.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy and birth.%} Descending in order from Viṣṇu-
Brahmā-Svāyambhuvamanu-Priyavrata-Agnīdhra-
Nābhi-Ṛṣabha-Bharata.
<div n="NI"/>Emperor Priyavrata partitioned his empire to his eight
children. Agnīdhra got Jambudvīpa. Agnīdhra had
nine sons: Nābhi, Kimpuruṣa, Harivarṣa, Ilāvṛta,
Ramya, Hiraṇvan, Kuru Bhadrāśva and Ketumāla. On
the death of the father Jambudvīpa was divided into
nine states and Nābhi got the land called Hima. Nābhi
married Merudevī and got a son, Ṛṣabha. Ṛṣabha had
a hundred sons and Bharata was the eldest. (Chapter 1,
Aṃśam 2, Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Marriage, administration and entry into Āśrama life.%}
Bharata took over the administration of the kingdom
at the death of his father, Ṛṣabha. He married Pañca-
janī daughter of Viśvarūpa. They had five sons, Sumati,
Rāṣtrabhṛt, Sudarśana, Āvaraṇa and Dhūmraketu. The
Pañcama Skandha of Bhāgavata contains a statement
to the effect that India got the name Bhārata from
this king. (It is worthwhile remembering at this
juncture a previous statement that the name Bhārata
was obtained from Bharata, son of Duṣyanta). Bharata
like his forefather was very erudite and affectionate
and always respected his duties. He always meditated
on Brahmā and in his heart there shone the Parama-
puruṣa in the figure of Vāsudeva adorned with Srīvatsa,
Kaustubha, Vanamālā, Śaṃkha, Cakra, Gadā and
Padma. He ruled the country for a crore of years and
after that dividing the country among his sons went to
the āśrama of Pulaha Maharṣi to spend the rest of his
life there. On the rocks lying in the river flowing in
front of the Āśrama were the marks of Cakra on one
side and Nābhi on the other and the river therefore
came to be known as Cakranābhi. Bathing in this river
[Page120-a+ 59]
and doing pūjā Bharata lived there oblivious of the
world outside. (Pañcama Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Bharata and the deer.%} Bharata led a purely ascetic
life performing everyday the rites laid down by
scriptures and muttering the mystic formula of Brahmā-
kṣara. One day a thirsty pregnant deer went to drink
water in a nearby pond. As it was drinking it heard
the loud roar of a lion nearby. Frightened the poor
animal without even waiting to quench its thirst ran
into the forest and on its way delivered a child and the
deer-babe fell into the river. The deer exhausted and
tormented by fear ran into a cave and fell down dead.
Bharata happened to see the new-born deer floating
on the river and took it to his āśrama. From then on-
wards Bharata's mind was diverted from the spiritual
to the mundane effort of taking care of the young deer.
The deer followed him wherever he went and if it did
not turn up in time in the evening after grazing
Bharata went about in search of it weeping. Years went
by and Bharata became old and died with the name of
the deer on his lips. (Pañcama Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Rebirths of Bharata.%} Because he died with the
thought of the deer in his mind he was reborn as a
deer. The deer was aware of his previous birth and
regretted that he spent the life of a man for the sake
of a deer. The deer, therefore, left the house of his
mother in the mountain of Kālañjara and went to the
āśrama of Pulaha. The pious animal daily bathed in
the river and died there on the bank of that river. So
in its next life the deer was born as the son of a
brahmin in the line of Aṅgiras. That brahmin had two
wives and got nine sons of his first wife and one of the
second. The son born to the second wife was none other
than Bharata. In due course the brahmin died and his
second wife jumped into the funeral pyre and ended her
life. Thrown an orphan Bharata became a puppet in
the hands of his brothers. Bharata was asked to look
after the cattle and fields of his brothers for his living.
With great forbearance Bharata did all he was told.
<div n="NI"/>One day Bharata was keeping watch over the fields of
his brothers. It was midnight. In the neighbourhood
the Caṇḍālas were making merry over the birth of a
child to one of the women. Some of them were bringing a
man bound by ropes to be given as ‘Narabali’ to the
goddess Kālī. (Narabali is the offering of a human
being with his head cut off to propitiate a deity). On
the way the man escaped and the disappointed
Caṇḍālas were roaming about in search of a substitute
when they came across Bharata keeping watch over
the fields. Immediately he was bound by ropes and
taken before the idol of Kālī. The effulgence of the
brahmin astounded Kālī and getting angry for bringing
such a pious brahmin for sacrifice she devoured the
Caṇḍālas and allowed the brahmin to go free.
<div n="NI"/>Escaping from there Bharata reached a village walking
all the way. That village was being ruled over by a
king called Rahūgaṇa and that king was going to see
Bhagavān Kapila Maharṣi along the banks of the river
Ikṣumatī in a palanquin. The palanquin had not enough
[Page120-b+ 63]
bearers and so the brahmin was asked to join the
team of bearers. As they were moving the palanquin
shook because of the wrong steps kept by Bharata. The
king reprimanded Bharata and Bharata then gave the
king fitting replies based on the ethics of Vedānta. The
erudition of Bharata greatly impressed the king and he
stepped down from the palanquin and bowed to
Bharata.
<div n="NI"/>Bharata went from there to the forests singing devo-
tional songs in praise of Viṣṇu and at last attained
salvation. (Pañcama Skandha, Bhāgavata).
