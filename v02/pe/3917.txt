KUŚASTHALĪ¦. The ancient name of Dvārakāpurī;
an island. It was emperor Revata, son of Ānarta, the
grandson of Vaivasvata Manu, who first built a city in
Kuśasthalī and ruled the country. Their genealogy;
Descended from Viṣṇu thus: Brahmā—Marīci—Kaśyapa
—Vivasvān—Vaivasvata Manu—Śaryāti (Śayyāti)—
Ānarta—Revata. Certain Purāṇas state that it was
Ānarta, who first built forts at Kuśasthalī. It would not
be incorrect to say that Ānarta built forts in this city
first founded by his son Revata. The city was sunk in
the sea after a few years. Afterwards the region re-
mained as a forest for long years. It was later on that
Śrī Kṛṣṇa built Dvārakā there. Following Kṛṣṇa's
death the Yādava dynasty got annihilated and the
region was again swallowed by the ocean. Dvārakā is
believed to have been an island situated in the sea to
the west of Gujarat. Even today there is a place called
Dvārakā on the coast of India to the west of Gujarat.
