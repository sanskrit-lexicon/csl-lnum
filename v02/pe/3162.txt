KĀLIYA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Kaśyapa, grandson of Brahmā and son of
Marīci begot of his wife Kadrū powerful nāgas like
Śeṣa, Airāvata, Takṣaka, Kārkoṭaka, Kāliya, Maṇi-
nāga, Purāṇanāga etc. and from them were born all
kinds of nāgas on earth. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 35).
Kāliya possessed one thousand heads. (Bhāgavata,
10th Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Kāliya took his abode in Kālindī.%} Vinatā and Kadrū
were wives of Kaśyapa. The former was the mother
of Garuḍa and the latter of the nāgas. In a wager
Vinatā was defeated and had to become the slave of
Kadrū. Garuḍa brought Amṛta from Devaloka and
redeemed his mother from slavery. Yet Garuḍa and
the nāgas continued to be enemies, Garuḍa killing and
eating nāgas whenever he got a chance for it. At last the
nāgas entered into an understanding with Garuḍa
agreeing to give him the havis (offering) which they
got on certain days, and thus Garuḍa stopped eating
the nāgas. But Kāliya did not subscribe to the above
agreement; he treated Garuḍa with contempt. But, in
an encounter with Garuḍa Kāliya was put to so much
of hardships that he, along with his family, shifted his
residence to a particular sector in Kālindī.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Admission denied to Garuḍa.%} Owing to the curse of
a sage called Saubhari, who was performing penance on
the banks of Kālindī, that Garuḍa would die broken-
headed if he entered Kālindī, it was a prohibited area
to Garuḍa.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Suppression of Kāliya.%} Owing to the virulent poison
of Kāliya the waters of Kālindī became poisonous and
the trees on its banks dried up. Once, while Kṛṣṇa
and his companions, the Gopālas came to the banks of
the river grazing their cows. The Gopālas drank water
from the river and fell down dead. Then Kṛṣṇa jump-
ed into the river from the top of a tree on its bank and
danced upon the hoods of Kāliya who had rushed to
[Page376-b+ 65]
attack him. Kāliya vomited blood and saluted Kṛṣṇa.
His wives and children also saluted the Lord. Kṛṣṇa
sent all of them away to Ramaṇaka island assuring
Kāliya that Garuḍa would not attack him on seeing the
marks of his (Kṛṣṇa's) feet on Kāliya. Thus did
Kāliya and his family shift their residence to Rama-
ṇaka island. (Bhāgavata, 10th Skandha).
