KALĀVATĪ I¦. A daughter of the King of Kāśī.
This gem of a woman worshipped the sage Durvāsas
and became a saint by obtaining the Śaiva Pañcākṣara
(five letters pertaining to Śiva—Sivāya namaḥ). After-
wards Dāśārha, King of Mathurā, married her. The
King felt very hot whenever he approached her and
he questioned her about it. She said she had received
the Pañcākṣara Mantra even from childhood and
sinners would feel the heat if they touched her. The
King was greatly disappointed and Kalāvatī took him
to Sage Garga to redeem him from all his sins. The
sage dipped the King in the river Kālindī and when
the King rose up all his sins flew away from his body as
tiny birds. The King reaching the palace, embraced
Kalāvatī and then he felt her body very cool and
pleasant. They got a son also. (Pañcākṣaramāhātmya,
Śiva Purāṇa).
