PRAMĪLĀ¦. Chief of the Strīrājya (country of women)
in the Himālayas. The Pāṇḍavas conducted an aśvame-
dhayāga after the great battle. It was Arjuna who follow-
ed the sacrificial horse. Roaming about without any-
body daring to tie it the horse reached Strīrājya and
Pramīlā tied the horse. Arjuna challenged her and in
the fight that ensued Pramīlā defeated Arjuna. At that
time there was a voice from heaven which said “Arjuna,
you will never be able to take back the horse after de-
feating Pramīlā. So if you want to save the sacrificial
horse, enter into a truce with her and make her your
wife.” Arjuna took the advice and saved the horse
after marrying Pramīlā. (Jaiminīya, Aśvamedha Parva,
21—22).
