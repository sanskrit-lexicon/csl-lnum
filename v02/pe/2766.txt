the same as Delhi, the capital of modern India.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Construction.%} As ordained by Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Dharma-
putra, claimant to half of the kingdom, went to the
forest Khāṇḍavaprastha with his brothers. Śrī Kṛṣṇa
stood by them; great sages like Vyāsa helped them.
There, in the forest, they built a city called Indraprastha
as beautiful as Indraloka. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter
211).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Reconstruction.%} Once Agni burned down the Khāṇ-
ḍava forest. (See under Khāṇḍavadāha). Arjuna saved
Maya and five others from the fire. Maya asked Arjuna
what he should do in return for saving his life. Arjuna
replied that it was not proper to expect any reward for
saving one's life and that, if Maya was very keen about
doing something in return, it might be done for Kṛṣṇa.
Then Kṛṣṇa asked Maya to build for the Pāṇḍavas a

Maināka to the west of Mount Kailāsa, where
in the pool called Bindu he had stored a large quantity
of gold and gems. Maya brought those materials as
also a conch called Devadatta from there and built the
most beautiful palace in the world at Indraprastha.
Within the palace were made many a beautiful pool and
various patterns with galleries etc. in glass. It was built
so beautifully and in such a manner as to create, at the
very sight, the illusion that there was water where there
was really no water and vice versa. It took fourteen mon-
ths to complete the construction of that most beautiful
model of architecture. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapters
1-3).
<div n="NI"/>3) Vajra, son of Aniruddha of the Yādava dynasty
was made master of Indraprastha after the time of the
Pāṇḍavas. (M.B. Mausala Parva, Chapter 7, Verse
11).
