<div n="NI"/>3) {%Marriage.%} Ruru happened to see the exceedingly
beautiful Pramadvarā the daughter of Viśvāvasu by
Menakā. The moment he saw her he fell in love with
her. The father of Pramadvarā came to know of this
and he decided to give her in marriage to Ruru.
Preparations for the marriage were being made. One
day during that time Pramadvarā who had been run-
ning here and there joyfully, was bitten by a snake
and she fell down dead. Ruru instantly reached the
spot.
<div n="NI"/>Ruru who was greatly sad and disappointed, got down
to the Ganges and bathed. Then rinsing his mouth
he took some water in his hand and said “By the
favour of God I have acquired by my devotion and
worship of gods, devotion and service to my teacher,
by my scripture-study, my worship with Gāyatrī, my
prayer, and meditation, my penance, my offerings to
the holy fire, and my oblations, let her come to life.
If she does not come to life, I will die in this Ganges
water.” Making this prayer, making the gods witnesses
he poured the water down.
<div n="NI"/>Immediately a messenger from heaven appeared in the
sky and said that she would come to life again provided
Ruru was prepared to give half of his life to her. Ruru
agreed to it. Thus Pramadvarā came to life again and
Ruru married her. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 2).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Hatred towards Serpents.%} A relentless hatred grew up
in the heart of Ruru against serpents, because a serpent
had killed his wife. He wandered about destroying
every serpent he come across. Finally when he confronted
Ḍuṇḍubha he was given exhortations and good advices
regarding righteousness by Ḍuṇḍubhla. (M.B. Ādi Parva
Chapter 9, Stanza 19). Moreover it is mentioned in
Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter 12, that Ruru had
taken a lively interest in the sacrifice of Janamejaya
meant for the extermination of serpents.
