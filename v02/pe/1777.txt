DĀŚĀRṆA¦(M). An ancient country, famous in the
Purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} This country had been divided
into two, Eastern Daśārṇa and Western Daśārṇa. The
modern Patna and the surrounding places comprised
Eastern Daśārṇa and the places of Malva, the Western
Daśārṇa. Some are of opinion that Daśārṇa comprises
the South-East part of the Vindhya mountain. It is men-
tioned in ‘Meghadūta’ that Vidiśā was the capital of
Daśārṇa. The modern name of Vidiśā is Bhilsā.

went in the guise of a male and married the daughter
of Hiraṇyavarmā. The king of Daśārṇa who had been
deceived thus, attacked Drupada. But the problem was
