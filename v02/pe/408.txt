ARAKKILLAM¦. (Palace of wax). Both the Kaurava
and the Pāṇḍava princes lived in Hastināpura. The
Pāṇḍavas became experts in archery, and their exemplary
character and conduct made them, so to say, the apple
of their eyes to the people. This evoked great jealousy
in Duryodhana who made up his mind to completely
ruin the Pāṇḍavas somehow or other. Duryodhana, with
Dhṛtarāṣṭra's consent, built a new palace at Vāraṇā-
vata. Though many others did not know that the
palace was made of wax the Pāṇḍavas, from secret
information knew the fact. But, they only pretended
ignorance. Duryodhana and his minister Purocana,
saw to it that the Pāṇḍavas shifted their residence to
the waxen palace. Duryodhana had planned to set fire
to the palace and burn to death the Pāṇḍavas. But, the
shrewd Vidura through his messenger Kanaka gave
notice of the conspiracy to the Pāṇḍavas just in time.
One night Purocana set fire to the waxen palace, but
the Pāṇḍavas escaped by a secret passage, which the
architect of the palace had made while constructing
it, and about which the Pāṇḍavas had previous know-
ledge. The same night a huntsman, with his five children,
was also staying in the palace. As they were uncon-
scious with heavy dosage of liquor they could not es-
cape the fire. Those six people, and accidentally
Purocana too were burnt to death. People, who gather-
ed at the spot, thus saw seven corpses, and the news
was broadcast that the Pāṇḍavas, including their wife
Pāñcālī and their mother had been burnt to death.
This incident took place one year after the Pāṇḍavas
had shifted their residence to the waxen palace. (M.B.,
Ādi Parva, Chapters 141-151).
