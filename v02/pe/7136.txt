ŚUNASSAKHA¦. Indra. Once Indra disguised himself as
a Sannyāsī and travelled in the company of a dog. At
that time, he made an attempt to steal lotus flower
from Brahmasaras in Kauśikī tīrtha. Indra struck down
at a single blow, Yātudhānī, the woman guard of the
saras, who opposed him. From this time when Indra
went about in the company of the dog, he got the name
“Śunassakha”. (M.B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 94).
