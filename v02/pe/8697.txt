YAJÑADATTA I¦. A youthful sage. In Agni Purāṇa.
Chapter 6, it is stated that this youth was shot dead
with an arrow by Daśaratha, mistaking him for an
elephant, on the bank of the river Sarayū. But Vālmīki
Rāmāyaṇa says that the name of the boy-sage who was
shot dead by Daśaratha was “Śravaṇa”. For more
details see 3rd Para under Daśaratha.
