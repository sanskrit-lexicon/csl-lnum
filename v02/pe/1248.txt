BRAHMĀ¦:
<div n="NI"/>One of the trimūrtis of the Hindu Pantheon. The tri-
mūrtis are Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} God who is the creator of the
Universe. It is mentioned in the Purāṇas that Brahmā
creates, Viṣṇu preserves and Paramaśiva destroys the
universe.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The birth of Brahmā.%} The birth of Brahmā is from
the nave of Viṣṇu. It is mentioned in Devī Purāṇa,
Skandha 1, about the birth of Brahmā as follows:—
In the beginning Mahāviṣṇu lay on a banian leaf in the
shape of a baby and began to think, “Who am I? Who
created me? What for? What is my work? Where to
work?” and so on. At that time an ethereal voice said:—
“Sarvaṃ khalvidamevāhaṃ nānyadasti sanāta-
nam”.
<F>*) Idaṃ sarvaṃ khalu aham eva, Sanātanam anyad nāsti. All these are myself. Except me there is nothing eternal.</F> Mahāviṣṇu was amazed at this ethereal
voice. He did not know whose oracle it was. Still He
lay meditating upon the words. Then Mahādevī,
with four hands and weapons such as Śaṅkha (conch),
Cakra (wheel), Gadā (club), Padma (lotus) and
maids who are prosperities and having worn glorious
clothes and ornaments, and accompanied by the Śaktis
[Page147-b+ 63]
(powers) named Rati, Bhūti, Buddhi, Mati, Kīrti,
Dhṛti, Smṛti, Śraddhā, Medhā, Svadhā, Svāhā, Kṣudhā,
Nidrā, Dayā, Gatī, Tuṣṭi, Puṣṭi, Kṣamā, Lajjā, Jṛṃbhā
and Tandrā, appeared before Mahāviṣṇu, who was
struck with wonder. Mahādevī said, “Oh, Viṣṇu, what
is there to wonder at? Every time the universe is sub-
jected to creation, preservation and destruction, you
are born thus due to the great power of the supreme
spirit. It seems that you have forgotten those matters.
Know that the supreme power is beyond qualities. We
are all with qualities. Your main quality is Sattva.
From your nave Brahmā will be born. His attribute is
Rajoguṇa (activity, passion or motion). From the middle
of the eyebrows of Brahmā, will be born Rudra, whose
attribute will be Tāmasaguṇa (darkness). Brahmā,
with the power of penance, will acquire the ability of
creation and by his attribute of Rajoguṇa will create
the world in the colour of blood. You will be the preserver
of that world. The same world will be destroyed by
Rudra at the end of the Kalpa (world age)”.
<div n="NI"/>Accordingly from the nave of Viṣṇu a lotus grew up and
in that lotus flower Brahmā took his form. The same
Brahmadeva did penance before Mahāviṣṇu and Jaga-
dambā, who were pleased at his penance and gave him
all the boons he wanted. After that Brahmā began the
work of creation. He created with his mind the Saptarṣis,
(seven sages) and then the Prajāpatis (the lords of
emanation). From them all the movables and the
immovables in the universe came into existence. (Devī
Bhāgavata, Skandha 7).
<div n="NI"/>In manusmṛti, Chapter 1, the following stanza about the
creation of Brahmā occurs.
<Poem>“Tadaṇḍamabhavad haimam
Sahasrāṃśusamaprabhaṃ /
Tasmin jajñe svayaṃ Brahmā
Sarvalokapitāmahaḥ” //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>That egg was as radiant as the Sun, with the colour of
gold. Brahmā the great grandfather of everything in the
world took birth by himself in it.
<div n="NI"/>From the supreme power, an egg fell on the water which
was the first creation. That egg became a germ of golden
colour. Creating a life, which had done penance in its
former births in such a way as to enable it to become
Brahmā, in the golden germ of the egg, the supreme power
entered the life that is to become Brahmā as its inner
guide. That Brahmā is known as the Pitāmaha (Grand-
father of the manes) or Paternal grandfather of all the
worlds.”
<div n="NI"/>Vāmanapurāṇa Chapter 43 states as follows about the
creation of Brahmā:—
<div n="NI"/>Ages before the beginning, when all the worlds with
everything they contained were submerged in the single
ocean of the great flood, the germ of living things formed
itself into a big egg. Brahmā who had been inside the
egg went to a long sleep. The sleep continued for a
thousand yugas (ages) when Brahmā woke up; as
Sattva guṇa (purity) was the foremost attribute of him,
he saw that the world was void. When the thought of
creation occurred in his mind Rajoguṇa (activity or
passion) became his foremost attribute. Rajas is the
attribute that creates and Sattva, that which preserves.
At the time of destruction Tamoguṇa (darkness) be-
comes the foremost attribute. That Bhagavān (Supreme
[Page148-a+ 64]
Spirit) the Puruṣa (the Male creative Energy) pervades
over everything, in all the living worlds. That Eternal
Being is Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>Knowing that the world was lying in pure water, the
Bhagavān (Supreme Being) cut the egg open. From it the
Oṃkāra (the sacred syllable ‘Om’) emanated. The
first sound of it was ‘Bhūḥ’, the second, sound, ‘Bhuvaḥ’
and the third sound ‘Svaḥ’. So they came to be known
as “Bhūrbhuvaḥ Svaḥ”. Then the glorious radiance of
the sun was born from it and Brahmā the grandfather of
the worlds originated in the centre of the egg.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Instigation to compose Rāmāyaṇa.%} It was Brahmā who
instigated Vālmīki to compose the Rāmāyaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>A fowler of the forest tribe shot down one of a couple of
snipes which were carrying on love-making, on the banks
of the River Tamasā. Seeing this Vālmīki cursed the
fowler. The curse came out of the mouth of Vālmīki
in the form of a verse,
<F>1) You forester, your life will not continue for many years since you have killed one of the couple of snipes.</F> “mā niṣāda pratiṣṭhām tvama-
gamaḥ śāśvatīḥ samāḥ, yat krauñcamithunādekam,
avadhīḥ kāmamohitam,” which according to hearsay,
is the first piece of poetry in the world. Brahmā who
was attracted by the poetry came to the hermitage of
Vālmīki and instigated him to compose the story of
Rāma in verse. It is stated in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
Bālakāṇḍa, Sarga 2, that the Rāmāyaṇa was composed
thus.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Rāvaṇa is given a boon.%} It was Brahmā who made
Rāvaṇa an ever-powerful hero. Penance was done by
Rāvaṇa in the vicinity of the Himālayas and Brahmā
appeared before him and granted him the boon that no
living creature except man, would kill him. (Vālmīki
Rāmāyaṇa, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Sarga 16).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The loss of a head.%} Long ago Śiva plucked off a head
of Brahmā. This story occurs in various purāṇas with
slight changes. Two of them are given below:—
<div n="NI"/>(1) In olden days, in the period of Satyayuga, Mahā-
viṣṇu did penance in Śvetadvīpa (the island Śveta)
to obtain Eternal Bliss, being deeply engaged in the study
of Brahmavidyā. Brahmā also went to another place
and began to do penance for the suppression of passions.
Both were doing severe penance. So they began to
walk in order to take rest from the penance. On the way
they met each other. One asked “who are you?” The
other also asked the same question. The talk ended in a
contest as to who was the greater of the two. Each
claimed himself to be the supreme power of the world.
Neither of them was prepared to recognize the claims
of the other. In the midst of this contest, a phallus,
extra-ordinarily bulky and fair appeared before them and
an ethereal voice said from the sky: “You need not
quarrel as to who is superior. He who reaches the extre-
mity of this phallus is the superior person. So both of
you proceed, one upwards and the other downwards
and find out the end.” Hearing this Viṣṇu went down-
wards to find out the bottom and Brahmā, upwards to
the top. Viṣṇu travelled for a long time and finding no
end thought the attempt futile and returned to the start-
ing point with disappointment and sat down.
<div n="NI"/>Brahmā travelled upwards for a long time and found no
end. On the way he saw the petal of a paṇḍānus flower,
coming down from the sky. Brahmā took it and joyfully
returned and said haughtily to Viṣṇu: “See, I have
taken this flower from the head of the Phallus. I have
[Page148-b+ 63]
brought this to convince you. You have been defeated.
So can you not admit that I am the superior?”
Mahāviṣṇu did not believe the words of Brahmā. So he
called the Paṇḍānus flower to him and questioned it.
The Paṇḍānus flower took false oath and witnessed in
favour of Brahmā, who had asked the flower before-
hand to be on his side. Mahāviṣṇu did not believe
this either and said, “Let Śiva be witness to this flower”.
Śiva at these words appeared before them and revealed
the deceit played by Brahmā and the flower and then
cursed the Paṇḍānus flower that thenceforward it
should not have a place among the flowers of oblation
to Śiva. Then Śiva got angry and plucked off a head
of Brahmā. That is the skull Śiva uses for receiving
alms. (Devī Bhāgavata, Śkandha 5.)
<div n="NI"/>(2) In days of old all the worlds with everything in them
were under water in a single ocean. The Sun, the
Moon, the Stars, air, fire, everything was destroyed. A
day of utter darkness appeared. Grass, bush all were
destroyed. Nothing could be seen and recognized. All
existents and non-existents were destroyed. Bhagavān,
(Supreme Being) was sleeping continuously for so many
thousands of nights. At the end of the night Bhagavān
assumed the attribute of Rajas (Activity) and got ready
for the work of creation. He, the knower of all Vedas
and Vedāṅgas appeared in the shape of a wonderful be-
ing with five faces. Another being with three eyes, matted
hair, a trident in one hand, and a garland of beads in the
other, and with darkness as its attribute took shape. That
being was called Puruṣa (the male creative energy).
Then the Mahātmā (the Supreme Spirit) created Ahaṃ-
kāra (Egoism). It affected Brahmā and Śiva. Overcome
by egoism, Śiva said to Brahmā:—“Who are you? Who
created you?” Swelled with egoism Brahmā asked in
reply:—“Who are you? Who are your parents? Let
me hear it.” This talk ended in a quarrel. The origin of
Bhagavān (the Lord) was from this quarrel. Immedi-
ately after his birth the Lord took an unparalleled lute
and playing it, went up to the sky. Śiva being defeated
by Brahmā, bowed his head and coloured. While Para-
meśvara was standing angrily thus, the fifth face told
him, “You, who are having three eyes and whose attri-
bute is darkness! look here! I will tell you all. You, who
wear air as garments, and ride on an ox, are the destroyer
of the world.” Hearing these words Śiva grew more and
more angry, opened his third eye and looked steadily
at Brahmā to burn him. Seeing the faces shining like the
Sun Brahmā said, “When you beat on water, bubbles will
appear. But do they have any prowess? Hearing this,
Śiva plucked off the head of Brahmā with the tip of his
finger nails. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 2).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Changing Vijayalakṣmī to Laṅkālakṣmī, by curse.%} Vijaya-
lakṣmī, one of the eight Lakṣmīs, was the treasury-
keeper of Brahmā. Once she became careless in dis-
charging her duties. Brahmā got angry and cursed her.
“You go to Rāvaṇa and keep his tower”. She humbly
requested for absolution from the curse. Brahmā said,
“At the time of the incarnation of Śrī Rāma, a monkey-
hero named Hanumān will reach Laṅkā in search of Śrī
Rāma's wife, whom Rāvaṇa had kidnapped. You will
obstruct him, and he will strike you down. On that day
you will be absolved from the curse and you will return
here instantly.” Accordingly Vijayalakṣmī was born in
[Page149-a+ 64]
Laṅkā under the name Laṅkālakṣmī. When Hanumān
jumped to Laṅkā she prevented him, and he struck her
down to the ground. (Kaṃpa Rāmāyaṇa, Sundara
Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Brahmā cursing the daughters of Himavān.%} Three dau-
ghters named Kuṭilā, Rāgiṇī and Pārvatī and a son
named Sunābha were born to Himavān by his wife
Menā. The three daughters went to the Himālayas for
penance, to get Śiva as husband. They were not even
six years old then. The devas saw them. The Ādityas
and the Vasus took Kuṭilā who was doing penance, to
the world of the gods. All the gods gathered together
and asked Brahmā. “Oh Lord, be pleased to tell us if
this girl will be able to bear a son who could kill Mahiṣā-
sura”. Brahmā replied. “This poor girl will not be
capable of bearing the radiance of Śiva. So let her go
away.” Kuṭilā got angry at Brahmā and said “Lord,
I will try to become fit to bear the unbearable radiance of
Śiva. Harken, I will do penance properly and please
Viṣṇu and make Śiva bow his head. I take a vow to
that effect.” Brahmā became angry and told Kuṭilā,
“You, wicked Kuṭilā, you did not succumb to my words.
So by my curse you will be turned to water.”
<div n="NI"/>Kuṭilā having been cursed by Brahmā became water
and began to flood the world of Brahmā. Seeing the flow
of water, Brahmā made cause-ways on four sides with the
Vedas of Ṛg, Yajus, Sāma and Atharva. Thus being
tied up she stays in the world of Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>The Devas took Rāgiṇī also before Brahmā and put the
same question. The reply of Brahmā was the same as
before. She also got angry and said to Brahmā. “I will
do great penance so as to enable to give birth to one in
my family to be the killer of Mahiṣāsura.” Brahmā
cursed her also. “You are deliberately disobeying my
words which even devas won't gainsay. So you will be-
come the colours of the twilight.” Thus she became the
fast colours of the twilight, and her body was divid-
ed among the Pleiades. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter
51).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Giving a boon to a tiger and golden colour to Pārvatī.%} The
first name of Pārvatī, the daughter of Himavān was Kālī.
She was given this name (Kālī) because of her dark
complexion. After the marriage Śiva and Pārvatī led a
household life in the golden house built by Viśvakarmā.
Once Śiva called Devī humorously, by the name Kālī.
Pārvatī got angry and said to her husband. “A wound by
an arrow will be cured. If you cut down a tree by an
axe it will sprout again. A wound inflicted by hard
words will never be cured. The arrows of words shoot
out of the mouth. Those who are hit by them suffer
pain day and night. Wise people should not shoot them
at others. You have violated that principle. So my lord,
I am going to do intensive penance. I will endeavour to
create such a condition, that you may not call me by the
name Kālī again.” Saying thus, Pārvatī bowed before
Parameśvara and bidding good-bye she went up into the
air and reached the peak of Himālayas and thought of
Jayā, Vijayā, Jayantī and Aparājitā. Instantly they
arrived to see Kālī. They got permission and stayed with
Pārvatī to attend on her.
<div n="NI"/>While Pārvatī was engaged in doing penance, a tiger,
with his weapons of tusks and claws came there from the
jungles of the Himālayas. Umā (Pārvatī) was standing
on one leg. The tiger began to think, “I shall do it when
[Page149-b+ 65]
it is needed”. Thinking thus it gazed at the face of Devī
with staring eyes and consequently it lost one eye.
<div n="NI"/>Pronouncing the word Brahmā Devī did penance for a
hundred years. After that Brahmā, the Lord of the three
worlds appeared before her and said to her: “I am much
pleased. Your penance was flawless. Ask your boon.”
Kālī replied, “Oh, Lotus-born! First give this tiger a
boon. It will please me.” Then Brahmā gave the wonder-
ful tiger leadership of the Gaṇas, devotion to Śiva, invin-
cibility and righteousness. After giving the tiger this boon
Brahmā told Pārvatī, “Now, Ambikā, ask your boon.
Don't hesitate, I will grant the boon.” Then Pārvatī
asked the boon. “Brahmā, give me golden colour”.
Brahmā said “Let it be so”, and disappeared. The
dark complexion of Pārvatī disappeared. She got the
colour of the filament of the lotus flower. From the dis-
carded skin Kātyāyanī was born. Then Indra appeared
and asked for her as a gift. Indra requested Pārvatī on
behalf of heaven. “Let me have her. Let this Kauśikī
be my sister. Because she was born from your Kośa,
(outer skin) she is Kauśikī, I am also Kauśika.” Devī
gave the beautiful Kauśikī to Indra. Sahasrākṣa (Indra
who has thousand eyes) took her to the Vindhya moun-
tain; when they reached there Indra told her. “You stay
on this mount, honoured and revered by gods. You will
be known as Vindhyavāsinī (who stays on the Vindhya).
He consecrated the goddess there. She was given a lion
as her carrier (Vāhana) “You destroy the asuras?”
saying so Indra returned to Heaven. (Vāmana Purāṇa,
Chapter 54).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Brahmā became river.%} Long ago in the period of
Cākṣuṣa manvantara (the age of a Manu), Brahmā
decided to perform a sacrifice on the Sahya Mountain
and preparations were made for it. Brahmā came with
Viṣṇu and Śiva. Bhṛgu and the other hermits took their
seats. Mahāviṣṇu called Svarādevī, the wife of Brahmā.
But she was very slow in coming. The hermit Bhṛgu
said to Viṣṇu: “You yourself have gone to call Devī.
But she is very slow. The auspicious moment is coming
to an end. So how are we to commence the rituals?”
“If Svarā does not appear before the end of the stipulated
time we shall seat Gāyatrī in her place,” said Viṣṇu.
Śiva also agreed to it. So Bhṛgu seated Gāyatrī on the
right side of Brahmā and the rituals were performed. By
then Svarā reached the sacrificial hall. When she saw
that Gāyatri was placed in her place and the rituals were
performed she became angry, because of her quarrel
with her co-wife. She called out: “Where the person to
whom respect is due, is not given respect and where the
person who ought not to be respected is given undue
respect, there, scarcity, death and fear will be rampant.
She dared to sit on the right in my place. So she will
grow lean and become a river which will not be seen in
the world. All of you will become rivers because you have
placed a person lower than me in my position.” Hearing
the curse of Svarā, Gāyatrī rose up trembling, and cursed
Svarā also to become a river. Before Svarā was changed
to a river, Brahmā and the other gods rose up and
requested for absolution from the curse. Svarā said,
“Gods, it is because you have not given oblations to
Gaṇapati in the beginning of the sacrifice, that this
break, due to my anger, has been caused. My curse
cannot be futile. So each of you change to a river by
your portions and we, your wives, will also become rivers
by our portions, and flow to the west.”
[Page150-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>Thus Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśvara became rivers
with their portions. Brahmā became the fast-flowing
Kukudmatī, Mahāviṣṇu changed to river Kṛṣṇā and
Śiva, the river Veṇī. The devas also changed their
portions to rivers and flowed from the Sahya mountain
to the east and their wives changed to rivers by their
portions and flowed to the west. Svarā and Gāyatrī
flowed as two rivers to the west and then joined together
as one river called Sāvitrī. Viṣṇu and Śiva who were
consecrated at the sacrifice by Brahmā came to be called
Bala and Atibala (Powerful and more powerful). This is
the origin of the rivers in Kerala. (Padma Purāṇa,
Chapter 113).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Brahmā is not worshipped.%} Long ago Brahmā and
Viṣṇu went to see Śiva near Himavān. They saw a shin-
ing phallus there in front of them. It was of immense
size. One of them went downwards and the other
upwards to find out the end of it. Both returned without
reaching the top or the bottom and by penance they
pleased Śiva who appeared before them and asked them
what boon they desired. Brahmā asked Śiva to take
birth as his son. Śiva did not like this and said that no-
body would worship Brahmā because of his extravagant
desire (namely, to have Śiva as his son). Viṣṇu requested
that he should be made a servant at Śiva's feet. So
Viṣṇu incarnated as Śiva's Śakti (power). That Śakti is
Pārvatī. So Viṣṇu and Pārvatī are one and the same in a
sense. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Kathāpīṭhalambakaṃ, Ta-
raṅga 1).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%The abode of Brahmā.%} It is said in Devī Bhāgavata,
Skandha 8, that the abode of Brahmā is on the top of
Mount Mahāmeru. There are nine towns there. Mano-
vatī which is in the centre, is the town of Brahmā. Due
east of Manovatī stands Amarāvatī, the town of Indra.
On the south-east corner there is Rajovatī which is owned
by Agni (fire-god). Due south of Brahmapurī there is
the town of Saṃyamanī which is the town of Yama (God
of death) On the south west corner there is the town of
Nirṛti. It is named Kṛṣṇāñjanā. On the west there is
the town called Śraddhāvatī. It is the abode of God
Varuṇa. On the north-west corner there is the town
called Gandhavatī which is the abode of Bhagavān
Vāyu (Wind-God). Due north to Brahmapurī stands the
town of Kubera (God of wealth). It is known by the
name Mahodaya. On the north east corner there is the
city of Śiva. It is known as Yaśovatī.
<div n="NI"/>11) {%The sons of Brahmā.%} Brahmā is the creator of all
the living things in the world. Still mention is made in the
Purāṇas about countless divine persons who were born
from the mind and body of Brahmā, directly and indi-
rectly. They are given below in groups.
<div n="NI"/>(1) Marīci, Aṅgiras, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, and Kratu.
It is mentioned in the Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter
65, Stanza 10, that these six grand hermits were born
from the mind of Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>(2) Dhātā and Vidhātā. It is mentioned in Mahā-
bhārata Ādi Parva, Chapter 66, Stanza 51 that these
two were good sons born to Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>(3) Rudra. Mention is made in Agni Purāṇa, Chapter
20, that Brahmā had a roaring son who was named
Rudra.
<div n="NI"/>(4) Svāyaṃbhuva Manu. It occurs in Bhāgavata
Skandha 11, that Manu Svāyaṃbhuva was the son of
Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>(5) Kandarpa (Kāmadeva—Cupid). In Kathāsarit-
[Page150-b+ 64]
sāgara, Lāvāṇakalaṃbaka, Taraṅga, 6, it is mentioned
that Cupid was born from the Egoism of Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>(6) Madhuka and Golikā. In Uttara Rāmāyaṇa, men-
tion is made that from the playful habit of Brahmā, a
giant named Madhuka and a giantess named Golikā
were born.
<div n="NI"/>(7) Bhṛgu. It is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva,
Chapter 5, Stanza 8, that the hermit Bhṛgu was the son
of Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>(8) Jāṃbavān. It is seen in Kaṃpa Rāmāyaṇa that
Jāṃbavān was born from the sweat of Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>(9) The Sanakas. In Bhāgavata mention is made that
the Sanakas (Sanaka, Sananda, Sanātana and Sanat-
kumāra) were sons of Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>(10) In Mahābhārata, Anuśāsana Parva there is a
passage given as the words of Vasiṣṭha spoken to Bhṛgu,
about the birth of many of the sons of Brahmā. “May
I tell you a story I have heard long ago about the revela-
tion of Brahmā of himself?
<div n="NI"/>Lord Rudra took the form of Varuṇa and performed a
sacrifice. Many hermits, all the devas, Agni and others,
Vaṣaṭk ra (Exclamation in sacrifice) which took body,
and all yajñāṅgas came to the sacrificial hall. All the
expedients, all the glories which are thousands in number
took shape and came to the sacrifice. Ṛgveda arrayed
in garments of heroism came there. All the omens, all
the voices, all the emotions, all the etymologies of pro-
nouncing Veda Sūktas, all the svarabhaktikas, Oṃkāra
(the syllable Oṃ) the eye of all the Vedic metres and
their theories, all restraints and donations, all Vedas,
Upaniṣads, accomplishments, Sāvitrī, the past, the near
future and distant future, all these came there. The
Lord Śiva held everyone of them. He offered his spirit
by his spirit. The sacrifice took many forms and shed
radiances. Paramaśiva is heaven, is the sky, is the earth,
is the ether and the husband of the Earth, is the lord
of all accomplishments, is noble and the lord of radiance.
This Lord is lauded by the names Brahmā, Śiva, Rudra,
Varuṇa, Agni, and Prabhāvatī. Śiva is the King of all
the worlds. Penances, sacrifices, vows emblazed by fast,
all the directions and gods of directions, Indras, celestial
maids, mothers of the worlds, all these assumed forms
and came to the sacrifice in multitudes. Everybody who
witnessed the sacrifice of Parameśvara, who was in the
form of Varuṇa, was greatly pleased. Seeing the pleased
celestial maids standing in rows passion arose in Brahmā.
He had seminal discharge. Āditya (the Sun) took the
earth on which the semen fell and threw it into the sacri-
ficial fire, which blazed furiously. Brahmā who became
the offerer of oblation had discharge again. He got it in
the sacrificial ladle and with recitation of spells offered
it in the sacrificial fire as if it was ghee. The powerful
semen contained the three attributes of Sattva, Rajas
and Tamas. From the attribute of Rajas arose the
living world which had activity as its purpose. Radiance
is the quality of Sattva which entered the living and non-
living world. It gives light to everything. It also gives
the power of discrimination. From the semen offered
in the fire, three sons with body and the attributes of
demi-gods came out. The male who had originated from
the flame called ‘Bharjana’ became Aṅgiras. The male
who originated from the burning coals became Kavi.
Over and above these three radiances, other radiances
also originated from the sacrificial fire. From the Marīcis
[Page151-a+ 65]
(rays) of the fire Marīci the father of Kaśyapa was born.
From the Kuśa-grass spread on the floor of the hall of
sacrifice, the Bālakhilyas were born. Atri also was
born from the Kuśa-grass. The noble hermits called
Vaikhānasas, who have grown powerful by penance and
became the seat of all good qualities, were born from
the sacrificial ashes. From the stream of fire which are
the eyes of the sacrificial fire the handsome Aśvins
were born. The rest of the Prajāpatis were born from
the ears of the fire. From the pores of the skin of fire
were born the hermits, from the sweat the ‘chandas’
(metre of Vedas) and from might, the mind. For this
reason the Vedic scholars and knowers of the Śruti and
those who see the superiority of Vedas, say that fire is a
combination of all the gods. The trees that feed the fire
are called Māsas (months), the sap of the tree is called
Pakṣa (half of the month i.e. full moon to new moon and
new moon to full moon), the pith of the tree is called
night and day and the flames are called Muhūrtas
(auspicious moments). Rudras were born from the
blood of fire and the golden coloured gods, the Maitras,
also were born from the blood of fire. From the smoke
of the fire, the Vasus, from the flame of the fire Rudras
and the Ādityas of the extreme radiance were born.
The planets and stars which stand in their places in
the sky are the charcoal of the fire. Brahmā declared that
fire was Brahmā the supreme spirit, eternal and the
giver of all wishes. The sinless Mahādeva, who was in
the form of Varuṇa said, “This sacrificial fire is mine,
and I am the sacrificer. So the children born as the first
fruit of this sacrifice are mine. So Bhṛgu, Aṅgiras and
Kavi are my sons, no doubt. Let everybody who moves
along the sky know that these three are my sons, the
fruit of my sacrifice.” Agni said, “These are born from
my organs. They had been depending on me for their
sustenance. So they are my sons.” Brahmā the teacher
of all the worlds and the grandfather of all living beings
said, “They are my sons. I offered my sperm to the fire,
and these sons were born therefrom, How can they be
claimed by anybody else? Here, I am the utterer of the
spell and the offerer of the sperm. I am the owner of
the sperm. Am I not the owner of the fruit? There is no
contest on the point that the birth of Bhṛgu and others is
from the oblation of my sperm.” The Gods who heard
these arguments bowed their heads before Brahmā and
greeting him said, “Lord Brahmā, It is not only us that
are born from you, but the entire world of living and
non-living is born from you. So let Agni and Deva in
the shape of Varuṇa have their wishes.”
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Brahmā and the giantess Karkkaṭī.%} In days of old, a
ferocious giantess named Karkkaṭī lived on the northern
side of the Himālayas. Because of the hugeness of her
body and the scarcity of food she became famished. She
began to do penance for the alleviation of her hunger
and thirst. She stood on one leg in the Himālaya Moun-
tain, fixing her eyes on the sun in the day and on the
Moon in the night, and the severe penance continued
for a thousand years. Then Brahmā appeared before her
and told her that she could ask for any boon. She said
“I wish to become a Sūcī (Needle) as hard as iron, hav-
ing the form of disease. This is the boon I pray for,
Brahmā”. Brahmā blessed her and said, “Let it be so,
my daughter, you shall be a sūcikā (needle) with the
prefix ‘V’ that is Viśūcikā (Spasmodic cholera) You
can eat those who eat stale food, those who are wicked,
[Page151-b+ 65]
those who sit in places where they ought not to sit and
those who are hard-hearted. Enter into their bodies and
affect their hearts, spleens and life-breaths. Thus carry
out the work of destruction? You can affect both the
good and the bad. But good people should not be killed.
So to save them from death, you can use this mantra
(spell).
<div n="NI"/>“oṃ, hrāṃ, hrīṃ, śrīṃ, śāṃ, viṣṇuśaktaye, namaḥ;
bhagavati viṣṇuśakti ehi, enāṃ hara hara: dehe hana
hana? paca paca! matha matha: utsādaya utsā-
daya: dūre kuru kuru svāhā—viṣūcike! tvaṃ hima-
vantaṃ gaccha? jīvasaraḥ candramaṇḍalaṃ gatāsi
svāhā.”
<div n="NI"/>Saying these words Brahmā disappeared. Karkkaṭī made
her body smaller and smaller and finally assumed the
shape of a needle. After that she began her work by
entering the body of those who had lost their energy
because of illness, in the form of a needle of gout and
caused Cholera, and the body of those who were lean
and worn and weary, in the form of internal cholera.
Thus assuming two bodies and killing countless people
she travelled for a long time in the earth and the sky,
until she herself felt aversion to her work. When she
remembered her original form she loathed the needle-
form. Karkkaṭī again went to the vicinity of the Himā-
layas and began to do penance, which lasted for another
thousand years. Thus she became pure and by the
power of thinking, she acquired spiritual knowledge.
Then she wanted to be saved from the mirage of birth
and death, to attain which, she did penance for yet
another thousand years at the end of which, the highly
pleased Brahmā appeared before her and said, “daugh-
ter Karkkaṭī, all the darkness is erased from your heart
and you have attained deliverance from delusion. Now
I will bless you according to your wish. Receive your
original body and walk about in the worlds eating the
ignorant, bad beginners, the imprudent, those who sit in
bad places and dwell in bad places.”
<div n="NI"/>She became a giantess again, but as she had attained
purity of soul, she engaged herself in deep meditation
which was free from doubt. The meditation lasted for a
long time. Finally her mind waved. Then she remem-
bered about worldly things and felt hunger. She remem-
bered, “Brahmā has ordained the wicked as my food.
So I shall seek them.” Thinking thus she went to a jungle
in the vicinity of the Himālayas. That was the dwelling
place of foresters. In that dark night the King and the
minister of the foresters approached the place where
Karkkaṭī sat. Karkkaṭī seeing them thought, “let me
know first if they are good or bad.” So she decided to
ask them some questions.
<div n="NI"/>She asked them in a voice like thunder. “Who are you?
Are you enlightened sages or ignorant fools? say quickly.”
The king of the foresters hearing this replied in a cynical
way. “You insignificant ghost? What is your form?
Where do you sit? Let us see your powerless body. Who
is there to fear at your sound which is like the humming
of a she-beetle?”
<div n="NI"/>Hearing this reply Karkkaṭī showed her tusks and lau-
ghed loud, to spread light, and to terrify them. They
heard the loud roaring sound of her laugh and saw her
huge form in the light. But those mighty heroes were
not at all shaken by the sound they heard or the sight
they witnessed. The Minister looked at her and said,
“Hei, Giantess? These delusions of yours will have no
[Page152-a+ 65]
effect on us. Even if a number of mosquitoes like you
come before us, they will be only dry leaves before wind.
You are acting like this merely for food. So what is
your need? Tell us, we will satisfy you”.
<div n="NI"/>Hearing the words of the minister Karkkaṭī knew that
her might was useless before such valiant men. She
thought them to be sages. So she said “Hey mighty
heroes. Who are you? Tell me the truth”. The minister
said: “This the King of foresters and I am his minister.
We came for a night-walk to find out and punish wicked
people like you.”
<div n="NI"/>The giantess appreciated them and said: “I am about to
put some questions to you. If you give me suitable ans-
wers you will be saved.” The King agreed. The ques-
tions put by her are given below in the order they were
asked:—
<div n="NI"/>1) Inside what atom which is unit and multiple at the
same time, do the lakhs of universes originate and vanish
as bubbles in a sea?
<div n="NI"/>2) What does shine as ether and non-ether?
<div n="NI"/>3) What is it that is something and nothing?
<div n="NI"/>4) What is it that is going and not going at the same
time?
<div n="NI"/>5) What is it that has taken form from voidness?
<div n="NI"/>6) What is it that is moving and at the same time station-
ary as a rock?
<div n="NI"/>7) Who draws pictures in clear sky?
<div n="NI"/>8) In what seed do the worlds exist as a big tree in its
seed?
<div n="NI"/>9) From what substance can the living and non-living
things in the worlds, not be separated as the foam and
waves cannot be separated from the ocean?
<div n="NI"/>10) What substance is dualism not separate from
(others) as fluidity from water?
<div n="NI"/>The reply given by the minister to each question is given
below in the order of the questions.
<div n="NI"/>1) Hey, Giantess: All the questions you have put be-
fore us encased in figurative words discernible only to
the Vedic sages, are concerned with the supreme Being.
The atom is the supreme Spirit which is beyond all
knowledge of the mind and the senses. As it is without
organs of action it is as unmanifested as the sky. And
inside that supreme atom which could be felt only by the
mind, crores and crores of bubbles of universes originate
and vanish due to frailty.
<div n="NI"/>2) The impersonal Supreme Being, having no substance,
pervades everything. This Supreme Being, Brahman,
is pure knowledge (Jñānasvarūpa). It is the sky and the
non-sky.
<div n="NI"/>3) As it is indescribable the Impersonal Supreme Spirit
is nothing, but as it is a reality it is something.
<div n="NI"/>4) As it pervades everything accessible, the Impersonal
Supreme Spirit has the quality of motion. But as it has
no emotions and as there exists no space beyond, it is
motionless.
<div n="NI"/>5) As it is inaccessible to others the Supreme Spirit is
having no existence, but as it is the essence of everything
that is good, it has existence.
<div n="NI"/>6) The Supreme Spirit is the radiance of motion or
activity and as there is nothing else to be found out, that
is, as it doesn't know anything else it is as rigid as a
rock.
<div n="NI"/>7) In the clear sky the Supreme Spirit draws the pictures
of the universe.
<div n="NI"/>8) Exists in the Supreme Atom.
[Page152-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>9) As the entire visible world cannot be separated from
the Supreme Spirit nothing is other than the Impersonal
Supreme Spirit.
<div n="NI"/>10) The differentiations of the various worlds are mere
appearances of the Supreme Spirit and so dualism is of the
same figure.
<div n="NI"/>The King drew Karkkaṭī nearer to the Impersonal
Supreme Spirit. He advised her not to commit slaughter.
She accepted the advice. The King asked her to come
to his palace assuming the form of a beautiful woman.
She asked, what could he offer to a giantess as food.
The King said: “You good woman, we shall find out a
way for that. You change yourself to a beautiful woman
wearing golden ornaments and stay in my palace for a
while. I shall arrange to gather sinners, robbers and
such other wicked people who are to be given capital
punishment, in thousands from various places, and shall
give them to you. You can take your original form and
take them all to the peaks of the Himalaya and feed on
them.
<div n="NI"/>Gluttonous people like to eat in solitude. After having
eaten sumptuously, take some sleep, and a little rest in
meditation. When you wake up you come again and
take away people destined to be killed. The slaughter
done for the sake of righteousness is not a sin. It is said
to be equal to mercy. When your desire for meditation
is over you must come to me. If an attachment of love
is formed even with bad persons it is difficult to break
the love.”
<div n="NI"/>Karkkaṭī obeyed the King. They all reached the palace.
Within six days three thousand wicked persons, who
were sentenced to death, were brought before the King,
from his own country and the various dependent coun-
tries, and were given to Karkkaṭī. In the night she took
her original form, gathered all the wicked people, who
deserved killing and bidding good bye to the King,
went to the Peaks of the Himālayas. (Jñānavāsiṣṭha).
<div n="NI"/>13) {%Brahmā and Haindavas.%} At the end of the day of
Brahmā there was the great flood, and destroying all the
heavens, Brahmā went to sleep. He woke up next morn-
ing and after the usual morning ablutions, prepared for
creation. He looked around at the sky, and saw some
heavens still engaged in usual activities. He was amazed
at this unusual occurrence. Ten Brahmās and the count-
less devas (gods) under them were doing their routine
work. Brahmā stared at the worlds for a long time think-
ing “How is it”. Then he by his divine power caused one
of the suns, working in a heaven, to come to him, and
asked him. “Who are you, shining one? How have these
worlds come into existence?”
<div n="NI"/>The Sun said with humility. “Your sons Marīci and
others erected a beautiful shed called Suvarṇataṭam,
in a corner of Jaṃbudvīpa in the valley below Kailāsa.
A Brāhmaṇa named Indu arose from that hall.
The Brahmāṇa who was a Vedic scholar, righteous
and peaceful, led the life of a house-holder with his
wife for a long time. But they were childless. So they
went to Kailāsa and did penance to get children. They
entered a natural arbour which was quite silent and began
severe penance. Śiva appeared and said that they
would get children.
<div n="NI"/>In course of time, ten sons were born to them. After
a long time, when the sons had reached manhood the
old parents died. The sons felt very sorry. They regarded
life as short and full of woe and misery. So they went for
[Page153-a+ 65]
penance, as they had no relatives left to care for them.
They abstained from all the pleasures of the world and
reached Kailāsa. They began to meditate upon the
shortness of life. “What is there which is noble in this
world? Is there anything except woe and misery? How
simple is the desire of man for greatness? One thinks
himself prosperous if he becomes a house-holder. The
head of the village is more prosperous than a house-
holder. The King of a dependent state is more powerful
than the head of a village. An independent king is far
more prosperous than a dependent King. When we
think of the state of an emperor how simple is an inde-
pendent king! When compared with Indra, the Lord
of the three worlds what is an emperor after all? But
there is nothing glorious in the state of Indra also as it
ends in a Brahmamuhūrtta (a period in the life of
Brahmā). So what is there substantial and eternal?
“Brahmā alone is eternal and indestructible.” said the
eldest brother. “Concentrate your mind and say to your-
self, ‘I am the supreme Being Brahmā seated on a lotus’,
and meditate upon it and pray for it and knowledge of
Brahmā will be conferred upon you.” They understood
this and thus the ten brothers became Brahmās. There
are ten heavens of them. They are ten worlds in the
sky of mind. I am the sun who creates day and night in
one of them,” saying thus the Sun went away. Brahmā
commenced his activity. (Jñānavāsiṣṭha).
<div n="NI"/>14) {%The age of Brahmā.%} Forty-three crores twenty lacs
of human years is one four-yuga period called ‘Deva-
caturyuga’ (a period of four yugas of the devas or gods).
One thousand deva caturyugas will make one Mahāyuga
(great yuga) A Mahāyuga is a day time of Brahmā.
During the period of one Mahāyuga, that is, during
one day of Brahmā, fourteen Manus, one after another,
help Brahmā in doing the work of creation. This is the
time of the seventh Manu in the present day time
(Kalpa) of the present Brahmā. The period of six Manus
are over in the present day time of the present Brahmā.
Vaivasvata is the present Manu. Brahmā wakes up in
the morning—the beginning of a Kalpa. Those which
underwent destruction in the night, are created again
in the morning. As Brahmā wakes up daily in the morn-
ing, what are the things created before, which do not
undergo destruction? At that time there will remain,
without destruction, six or twentyfour tattvas (princi-
ples) which are natural creations. These twenty-four
principles are not the creation of Brahmā. He who is
beyond names, He who created Brahmā in the lotus
flower, created them. Brahmā who was originated in the
lotus which grew from the nave of Nārāyaṇa performs
the work of creation guided by these twentyfour princi-
ples. The work of creation performed by Brahmā is
called Pratisarga (substitute creation). Everything
Brahmā created in the day time will be destroyed in the
evening. After a day time is over there is the night time
and sleep for Brahmā. The life of Brahmā is hundred
years, that is thirty-six thousand Brahmā days and
and Brahmā nights. At the expiry of this period the life
of Brahmā will come to an end, and will dissolve in
Nārāyaṇa. Thus crores and crores of Brahmās have
appeared and passed away and in future also crores
will appear and pass away. (Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>15) {%The creations and substitute creations of Brahmā.%} The
creations performed by Brahmā are of two kinds. The
first is Sarga or creation and the second is Pratisarga or
[Page153-b+ 63]
substitute creation. In the first Kalpa when a Brahmā
is born from the lotus, certain creations are made and
the things thus originated do not undergo destruction in
the evening or at the end of the Kalpa. They are the
sarga or creation. On that day and every day of the life
of Brahmā they help Brahmā in the work of creation.
In a sense they could be called Prajāpatis (the lords of
emanation). But as most of them have not left sons,
and for other reasons also, they are not well known by
that name. Only the persons mentioned here have as
long a life as that of Brahmā. The Sanakas, Karddama,
Marīci, Atri, Aṅgiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Bhṛgu,
Vasiṣṭha, Dakṣa, Nārada, Dharma, Adharma, Nirṛti,
Sarasvatī, Kāma, Atharva, the Manes, Agni, Sthāṇu,
and Svāyaṃbhuva: these do not end at the end of a
Brahmā's day (or Kalpa) and will be dissolved only when
Brahmā is dissolved. A Brahmā creates in his first morn-
ing not only persons from Sanaka to Svāyaṃbhuva, but
also creations which have a history only up to the end
of that day, such as the lokas (worlds) of Bhūloka,
Bhuvarloka and Svarloka, and minerals, plants, animals,
humanity etc. Sarga or creation is called Prākṛta Sṛṣṭi
(natural creation). Pratisarga or substitute creation
is called Aprākṛta Sṛṣṭi or unnatural creation. At the
end of the Kalpa, Saṃvarttakāgni (Fire which destroys
the universe) and Saṃvarttaka varṣā (Rain which des-
troys the universe) will occur and all the unnatural crea-
tions will be destroyed. In all the morning, following
the first morning of a Brahmā substitute creation takes
place, and they are destroyed at the end of each Kalpa
by Saṃvarttakāgni and Saṃvarttakavarṣā. (Bhāga-
vata).

He could not bear his beautiful wife to be away from
his sight even for a moment. So much had he become
attached to her.
<div n="NI"/>One day Śatarūpā was walking round Brahmā. The
daughters born from his mind also were seated close by.
So he could not turn round and round and look at his
wife as she was moving. To solve this problem, in place
of one face, there arose four faces.
<div n="NI"/>Once Śatarūpā was walking in the air. To see her at
that time there arose a fifth head on the top of his matted
hair. It is this face that was plucked off by Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>(53) Various stories occur in the purāṇas regarding how
Śiva plucked off the fifth head of Brahmā. They are
given below.
[Page155-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(1) Once Brahmā praised Śiva and pleased him and
asked him to become his son. Śiva did not like it. He
got angry and cursed, “I shall become your son. But I
will pluck off your fifth head.”
<div n="NI"/>(2) In the beginning Brahmā created the incarnation
of Śiva, called Nīlalohita also, along with the creation
of worlds and everything in it. In later creations Brahmā
did not think of Nīlalohita. Seeing Brahmā carrying
on the work of creation forgetting him, Nīlalohita got
angry and cursed Brahmā, “Your fifth head will shortly
be destroyed.”
<div n="NI"/>(3) After Brahmā became five-faced the brightness of
the devas began to decrease day by day. Seeing this the
conceited Brahmā said to Śiva: “I am the first who got
existence in this world. So by all means I am the eldest.”
Hearing this Śiva got angry and plucked off the fifth
head of Brahmā and threw it away. (Matsyapurāṇa,
183, 84-86).
<div n="NI"/>When the fifth head was gone, the rest of the heads were
benumbed. The sweat which flowed from them was
thrown into the earth by Brahmā. Out of it came out
a horrible monster, which began to chase Śiva, who
caught hold of it and gave it to Viṣṇu. (Skanda, 5,
13, 4).
<div n="NI"/>(4) In the Śiva-Rudra collections a story occurs about
the quarrel between Śiva and Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>Once Brahmā fell in love with Satī the wife of Śiva;
coming to know of this Śiva tried to kill Brahmā. Mahā-
viṣṇu tried to pacify Śiva, but it was of no avail. Śiva
took away the fifth head of Brahmā and made him ugly,
and consequently Brahmā became invincible in the
world.
<div n="NI"/>(5) Once Śiva showed his daughter Sandhyā to Brahmā
who grew lustful instantly; Śiva insulted Brahmā by
showing this ill-owned passion of his to his sons
(Brahmā's sons). As a revenge Brahmā created Satī
and insulted Śiva through Dakṣa. (Skanda, 2, 2, 26).
<div n="NI"/>17) {%Various names of Brahmā and their meanings:%} In Amara-
