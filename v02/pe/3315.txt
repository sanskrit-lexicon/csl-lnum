KARANDHAMA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} A King of Ikṣvāku Vaṃśa.
Descending in order from Ikṣvāku came Viṃśa—
Kalyāṇa—Khanīnetra—Suvarcas. Suvarcas later on
became famous as Karandhama.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How he got his name Karandhama.%} Once there came
a famine in the country of Suvarcas. The treasury
[Page390-a+ 65]
became empty. Taking that opportunity the enemies
attacked his country. There was no army for him to
fight against his enemies. Meditating upon God he
blew his hands and then an army sufficient to fight
his enemies appeared before him and using that he
defeated them. Because he arranged an army by
Karadhamana (blowing of hands) he was given the
name of Karandhamana also.
