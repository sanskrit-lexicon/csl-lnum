GĪTAVIDYĀDHARA¦. A great musician among the
gandharvas. When he found that sage Pulastya had
no liking for music he teased the sage by making the
sounds of a boar. The enraged sage cursed him and
turned him into a boar. He got relief from the curse
when Ikṣvāku killed him and Gītavidyādhara became
his old self again. (Chapter 46, Sṛṣṭi Khaṇḍa, Padma
Purāṇa).
