MANUṢYA¦ (MAN) The Purāṇas have not given a
definite explanation regarding the origin of Man, the
most important of all living beings. Many stories
regarding the origin of Man were current among the
ancient people. According to Hindu Purāṇas Man
was born of Svāyambhuva Manu who in turn was born
of Brahmā. According to Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa (Sarga 14,
Araṇya Kāṇḍa) all the living beings including man
were born to Kaśyapaprajāpati of his eight wives,
Aditi, Diti, Danu, Kālikā, Tāmrā, Krodhavaśā, Manu
and Analā. From Aditi were born the devas; from
Diti, the daityas; from Danu, the dānavas; from Kālī,
the asuras Kālaka and Naraka; from Tāmrā, the bird-
flock Krauñcī, Bhāsī, Śyenī, Dhṛtarāṣṭrī and Sukī;
from Krodhavaśā the animal flock, Mṛgī, Mṛgamandā,
Harī, Bhadramadā, Mātaṅgī, Śārdūlī, Svetā and
Surabhi; from Manu, mankind and from Analā, the
flora.
<div n="NI"/>There is basis to believe that the Greeks and the people
of Bhārata accepted with slight modifications the
theory of evolution. The Daśāvatāras of Viṣṇu almost
represents the progressive changes in the form of a
living thing from a fish into man. The theory of
Darwin that life was first formed in water was current
among the sages of ancient Bhārata, even from very
early times.

Tāsu vīryamapāsṛjat // </Poem>
(He created water first and cast virility therein).
<div n="NI"/>In the Daśāvatāras (ten incarnations of Viṣṇu) the
first avatāra is Matsya (Fish). The next one is Kūrma
or Tortoise which is a progress in the form of fish.
The third is Varāha or boar which is another step
forward in evolution. The fourth is Narasiṃha (Man
cum lion) which is the first step towards the formation
of Man. That avatāra has got the traits of both man
and animal. The next one is Vāmana or a small man.
Then Śrī Rāma and Śrī Kṛṣṇa, both fully grown men
but with different kinds of culture.
