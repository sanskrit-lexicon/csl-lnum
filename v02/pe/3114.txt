KĀLANEMI III¦. A Rākṣasa. During the Rāma-
Rāvaṇa war, when Lakṣmaṇa swooned, Hanūmān
started for Droṇa mountain for medicine. Rāvaṇa
deputed Kālanemi to obstruct the path of Hanūmān.
Well acquainted with the trickeries of the Rākṣasas Hanū-
mān killed Kālanemi who appeared before him disguis-
ed as a sage. (Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa,
Canto 67).
