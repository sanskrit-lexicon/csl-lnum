VĪRĀ III¦. The wife of King Karandhama. She was the
mother of Avikṣit. Once, when serpents began to do
harm to all the living and non-living things in the world,
Vīrā approached her grandson Marutta and advised
him to conduct a serpent-sacrifice. Marutta began the
sacrifice. The serpents were terrified and sought pro-
tection from the wife of Avikṣit. She being kind-hearted,
made her husband intervene and stop the sacrifice.
