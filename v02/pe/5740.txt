REVATĪ IV¦. The mother of Raivata, the lord of the fifth
Manvantara (age of a Manu). There is a story in the
Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa about the birth of Revatī.
<div n="NI"/>A son was born to the hermit Ṛtavāk on Revatī day.
<div n="NI"/>By and by he became wicked. Having learned from
the hermit Garga that his son became wicked because
he was born under the star Revatī, Ṛtavāk cursed the
star Revatī and kicked it down from its place. The spot
on which the star fell became a lake. After a time a
beautiful damsel was born from the lake. The hermit
Pramuca took the girl home and brought her up.
She was called Revatī. When she came of age, she was
given in marriage to Durgama, the son of king
Vikramaśīla. At the request of Revatī her marriage was
conducted at an auspicious moment on the day of the
star Revatī. The hermit blessed the couple “Let a son,
who would become the Lord of the Manvantara, be
born to you.” As a result of this blessing the bright and
valiant son Raivata was born to them. This Raivata
was the Lord of the fifth Manvantara.
