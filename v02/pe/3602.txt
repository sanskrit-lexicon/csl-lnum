KRAMAPĀṬHA¦. A method of teaching the Vedas. It
is due to the insistence on strict adherence to this
method of teaching that even after thousands of years
variations have not crept into the original texts of the
Vedas which form the earliest literature. There is a
portion called ‘word study’ (Pada Pāṭha) in the Vedas
(the scripture). Every word in the Veda is separated
from its prefixes and suffixes. The second step is Krama-
pāṭha or the study of joining prefixes and suffixes to
each word got by the first step. Next step is Jaṭāpāṭha
in which words are combined with their prefixes and
suffixes. To guard against the creeping in of mistakes
in this step, the next step which is known as Ghana-
pāṭha is taught. In this step the first step of Padapāṭha
and the second step of Krama pāṭha are mixed together
[Page416-b+ 64]
and intermingled from beginning to end and end to
beginning. There are rules to make combined words by
using prefixes and suffixes. These rules are called
Prātiśākhya. Because the Vedas are taught in this way
with so much attention and care, their texts have never
been subjected to changes and variations.
