AMITRAJIT¦. A King. In his country there were innu-
merable Śiva temples. Nārada Muni who was delighted
by this sight, went to the Palace and said to Amitrajit:
“In the city of Campakāvatī there is a Gandharva
virgin named Malayagandhinī. She has been abducted
by Kaṅkālaketu, a Rākṣasa. She has promised to marry
the person who will rescue her from him. Therefore
please save her from the Rākṣasa.” As suggested by
Nārada Amitrajit killed Kaṅkālaketu in battle and
recovered Malayagandhinī and married her. Vīra was
their son. (Skanda Purāṇa).
