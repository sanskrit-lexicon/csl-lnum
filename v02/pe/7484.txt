TĀMASA¦. The fourth Manu. (See under Manvantara).
Svāyambhuva Manu, son of Brahmā, was the first Manu.
He had two sons of Purāṇic fame named Priyavrata
and Uttānapāda. Of these Priyavrata married the
beautiful and virtuous daughters of Viśvakarmā the
Prajāpati. They were Surūpā and Barhiṣmatī. Of his
first wife Surūpā, he got ten sons Agnīdhra and others.
The youngest child was a daughter named Ūrjjasvatī.
Of the sons, Kavi, Savana and Mahāvīra became detach-
ed from worldly life and became learned in spiritual
knowledge. Priyavrata got of his second wife Barhiṣmatī
three sons named Uttama, Tāmasa and Raivata. They
were very valiant and they gradually became chiefs of
Manvantaras. (8th Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
