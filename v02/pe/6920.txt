SUDARŚANA VIII¦. A Vidyādhara. Because of the curse
of Aṅgiras, this Vidyādhara was changed into a moun-
tain snake. That story occurs as follows in Bhāgavata,
Skandha 9.
<div n="NI"/>While Sudarśana was playing about in the world of
Gods with some Gandharva damsels, Angiras and some
other hermits came by that way. Sudarśana ridiculed

them. Aṅgiras became angry and changed him to a
mountain snake by a curse. Sudarśana prayed for libera-
tion from the curse. Aṅgiras said that in Dvāparayuga,
Mahāviṣṇu would incarnate as Śrī Kṛṣṇa and when Kṛṣṇa
trod upon him, he would regain his original form.”
<div n="NI"/>Sudarśana became a big snake and began life in
Ambāḍi. Once the people of Ambāḍi went to Devī
forest and worshipped Maheśvara. They spent the night
on the banks of the river Kālindī. In the night the snake
mentioned above, caught hold of the leg of Nandagopa.
Seeing the snake swallowing Nandagopa the rest of them
crowded there and struck at the snake with burning
faggots. But it was in vain. Finally Śrī Kṛṣṇa came, and
gave the snake a thrash. Instantly Sudarśana got his old
form. He went to the world of gods.
