DRAVYAŚUDDHI¦. Purifying impure things, The
mode of purification of impure things, in ancient
India, was known as dravyaśuddhi. The procedure of
purification was as follows:
<div n="NI"/>If earthern-wares became impure by coming into con-
tact with urine or excreta, they should be burnt in fire.
Golden or copper vessels may be remoulded or filled
with or dipped in tamarind water. Things made of
iron or bronze may be washed in ash-water. Things
made of glass or pearl need only be washed in pure
water. Things born in water such as lotus etc. could
be purified by dipping them in water. If cloth is made
impure rub it with soil and dip it in water. If it is a
large quantity of cloth, a mixture of soil and water may
be sprinkled on it. Wooden things will become pure
by planing. Cot, chair, fan, cart etc. need only be
washed. Pots used for cooking meat may be touched

with cow's milk. Things made of ivory may be washed
in mustard-water. Jaggery, salt etc. need only be dried.
