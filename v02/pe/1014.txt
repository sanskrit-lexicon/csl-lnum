BHAKṢAKA¦. A Śūdra sinner. In Padma Purāṇa the
following story is related about this Śūdra.
<div n="NI"/>Bhakṣaka who was once going aimlessly somewhere
felt extremely thirsty, and quenched his thirst by
drinking water which was found near the small plat-
form raised for the holy Tulasī shrub. The sanctity of
the water thus drunk washed away all the sin attached
to him. Some time later he was killed by a forest-
dweller, and he attained svargaloka (heaven). Bhakṣaka,
in his previous birth, was a king who led a voluptuous
life, and he, once, robbed a very beautiful woman of
her chastity, and it was as a punishment for the sin
that the King had to be born, in the next birth, in the
womb of a Śūdra woman. (Padma Purāṇa, Brahma
Kāṇḍa, Chapter 22).
