BHAKTI¦. A Devī born in Drāviḍa deśa (Southern
India). Once Devī, along with her two sons, Jñāna
and Vairāgya, started on a walking tour to Gokula and
Vṛndāvana via Karṇāṭaka, Mahārāṣṭra and Gurjara
(Gujarat). During the long tour the mother and her
sons became aged. But, as soon as they set foot on
Gokula and Vṛndāvana old age quitted Bhakti and
she became young again. But, her sons remained old.
So the mother requested Nārada to turn them young
again. Nārada read out to them the Vedas, the
Vedānta (Upaniṣads) and the Bhagavad Gītā, all to no
purpose. Bhakti's sons still remained old. Then Sanaka,
Sananda and Sanatkumāra asked Nārada to read out
the Bhāgavata to them. Nārada did so, and the sons of
Bhaktī Devī became young again. (Padma Purāṇa).
