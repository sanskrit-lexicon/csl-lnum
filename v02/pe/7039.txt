ŚUKRA¦ (ŚUKRĀCĀRYA) I. Preceptor of the Asuras.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Views differ as to whether Śukra was the
son or grandson of Bhṛgu. The Purāṇas state that
Pulomā was the wife of Bhṛgu. Śukra has another name,
Kāvya. Kāvya means the son of Kavi. Some autho-
rities say that Kavi was Bhṛgu's son, while others think
that Kavi was Bhṛgu himself. Śukra's mother is re-
ferred to as “Kāvyamātā” in many places. Śukra is re-
ferred to as the strongest of the seven sons born to
Bhṛgu and Pulomā. In the light of these references it
is reasonable to consider Śukra as the son of the sage
Bhṛgu. “Kavi” must be supposed to be another name
of Bhṛgu. Uśanas was another name for Śukra.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Love story.%} Once the sage Bhṛgu lived in the valley
of Mandara mountain, performing austere tapas. Śukra
who was then a boy, used to attend on his father. One
day when Bhṛgu was absorbed in “Nirvikalpasamādhi”
(deep meditation) the lonely Śukra was appreciating
the beauty of the sky above him. There was no one
else by his side. At that time he happened to see an
exceptionally beautiful Apsarā woman passing across the
sky. His heart was filled with delight at the sight. All
his thoughts were centred on her and he sat absorbed
in her bewitching charm. In his imagination he follow-
ed Indra and reached Indraloka. Indra greeted him
with honour. After that Śukra, attended by the hea-
venly beings went about sight-seeing in Heaven. There
he unexpectedly came across the Apsarā beauty whom
he had seen earlier, in the midst of several other
women. They fell in love at first sight. To fulfil his
desire Śukra enveloped the whole place in darkness.
The other women left the place. The apsarā beauty
approached Śukra and both of them entered a hut form-
ed by the thick foliage of creeping plants and indulged
in sensual pleasures. Since Śukra spent a period of
eight Caturyugas like this in her company, he became
weak in his virtue and descended to the earth. Then
he became conscious of his physical being. His depraved
soul was stopped at the moon. It reached the earth
through mist and grew up as paddy plants. A Brāhmaṇa
who was a native of Daśārṇa land ate the rice which
was cooked from the ears of those paddy plants. Śukra's
soul in the shape of Śukra entered the womb of the
Brāhmana's wife and in due course took his birth.
Because of his close association with Munis, that boy
grew up like a sage and spent a period of one Manvan-
tara, leading an austere life in the valley of the Meru
mountain. At that time his Apsarā woman had been
born as a female deer, as the result of a curse. By
their connection in the previous birth, the Brāhmaṇa
fell in love with that female deer and begot a human
child by his union with her. With that the austerities
of his life were at an end. All his thoughts were now
directed towards the future glory of his son and he
ignored even his spiritual duties. Not long after, he died
of snake bite. Later, he was born as the son of the king
of Madra and ruled the country for many years. After
that he took birth in many other wombs and at last was
born as the son of a Maharṣi living on the bank of the
river Gaṅgā. Śukra's body which was by the side of
Bhṛgu dropped to the earth after being exposed to the
wind and sun for a long time. But owing to Bhṛgu's
[Page760-b+ 65]
power of tapas and the holiness of the āśrama, birds and
animals did not eat the body. After 1,000 divyavatsaras,
sage Bhṛgu opened his eyes from his samādhi but he did
not find his son near him. A famished and worn out body
was lying before him. Within the wrinkles of the skin,
small birds were nesting and frogs took refuge in the
hollow of the stomach. Enraged at the premature death
of his son, he was about to curse Yama, the god of Death.
Coming to know of this Dharmarāja (Yama) appeared
before him and said:—“We honour and adore you as
a great tapasvī. You should not ruin your tapas. I have
devoured numerous Brahmāṇḍas. I have already swal-
lowed Rudras and Viṣṇudevas many times. All of you
are my food. It is ordained by Fate. Even Brahmā is not
indestructible at the end of a Kalpa. Knowing all these
facts, why do you think of cursing me? Your son fell
into this state because of his own act. While you were in
a state of Samādhi your son's mind left its body
and went up to Heaven. There he spent many years in-
dulging in sensual pleasures in the company of the
celestial beauty Viśvācī. Then he was born as a Brāh-
maṇa in Daśārṇa country. In his next birth he became
the King of Kosala. After that passing through many
births in succession he is now performing tapas on the
bank of the river Samaṅgā as the son of a Brāhmaṇa,
under the name, Vāsudeva. Open your inner eye and
see for yourself.”
<div n="NI"/>After saying this Dharmarāja revived the body of Śukra
who rose up and did obeisance to his father. (Jñāna-
vāsiṣṭha, Sthitiprakaraṇam).
<div n="NI"/>(3) {%Domestic Life.%} It is seen that Śukra had several
wives and children. In Devī Bhāgavata there is a story
of Jayantī, daughter of Indra who was Śukra's wife for
about ten years. (See under Jayantī II). Priyavrata, the
brother of Uttānapāda had a daughter named Ūrjjasvatī
by his wife Surūpā. In Devī Bhāgavata, 8th Skandha
it is stated that Śukrācārya married Ūrjjasvatī and he
had a daughter Devayānī by her. Mahābhārata, Ādi
Parva, Chapter 65 mentions that Śukra was the ācārya
(preceptor) of the Asuras and his four sons were the
priests of the Asuras. Śukra had a daughter named
“Arā”. (See under Arā). Besides, Śukra had another
wife named Śataparvā.
<div n="NI"/>But no child was born to Śataparvā.
<div n="NI"/>Devī, wife of Varuṇa's elder brother, was a daughter of
Śukra. Ūrjjasvatī was the most famous among Śukra's
wives.

during the time of Mahābali, the Asura King. Mahā-
viṣṇu incarnated as Vāmana and begged three feet of
earth from Mahābali. Since Śukra tried to obstruct it,
Viṣṇu put out one of Śukra's eyes with the point of a
a darbha grass. (For more details see 3rd Para under
Mahābali).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Śiva swallowed Śukra.%} Once Śukra invaded Kubera
and plundered all his wealth. The distressed Kubera
informed Śiva about it. Śiva at once started up with
his weapon, shouting “Where is he?” Śukra appeared
on the top of Śiva's trident. Śiva caught hold of him
and swallowed him. Śukra who moved about in Śiva's
[Page761-a+ 64]
stomach found the excessive heat there, unbearable and
soon became exhausted. In his helpless state he began
to worship Śiva for his mercy. At last Śiva permitted
him to escape through his penis and Śukra thus came
out. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 290).
