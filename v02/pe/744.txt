ĀPASTAMBA¦. An ancient sage. He once consoled
King Dyumatsena. (Śloka 18, Chapter 298, Vana
Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%How he got his name.%} Once a brahmin did not get
a suitable man to officiate as priest for a śrāddha cere-
mony. He then prayed to his ancestors, Viśvedevas
and Mahāviṣṇu for help and then Āpastamba appeared
before him. The brahmin gave him food to his heart's
content and asked him how he felt. To the surprise of
the brahmin Āpastamba replied, he wanted some more
and thus made the Śrāddha ineffective. The brahmin
got angry and cursed him by sprinkling on his face
water taken in his palm. But before the water-particles
reached his face Āpastamba ordered the water-drops to
remain still. Water stopped stiff and still midway by
the power of the sage. Because water (Āpa) became
stiff (Stamba) the ṛṣi was named Āpastamba. (Brahma
Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How Āpastamba tīrtha came into existence.%} Once he met
Agastya Muni and asked him who was superior among
the gods Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva. Agastya declared
that Śiva stood supreme of the lot and gave him advice
as to how to please Śiva. Following his instructions
Āpastamba did penance on the banks of the river Gau-
tamī and Śiva appeared before him, blessed him, and
made that place a holy one. Śiva declared that those
who, bathed at that place would obtain ‘Divyajñāna’
(Divine knowledge enabling one to know the past,
present and future). From then onwards that place
was known as Āpastamba tīrtha.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Other details.%} Āpastamba had a very chaste and
humble wife named Akṣasūtrā. Their son was Gārki.
‘Gṛhyasūtrasaṃgraha’ containing a prayer and two man-
tras is a contribution to the holy science by Āpastamba.
Many Hindus follow it even now. He had stated
that the decrease in the number of great sages was
because of the fact that people were not practising the
control of the senses as before.
