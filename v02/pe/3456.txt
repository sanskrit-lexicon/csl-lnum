KĀVYAMĀTĀ¦. Mother of Śukra, the preceptor of the
Daityas.
<F>1) Śukra is also known as Kāvya. Certain Purāṇas claim Śukra as the son of Bhṛgu, while certain others refer to him as the son of Kavi
son of Bhṛgu. Pulomā was Bhṛgu's wife. But, the Purāṇas call the mother of Śukra Kāvyamātā. No mention is made about the wife of Kavi
the son of Bhṛgu. Pulomā and Kāvyamātā are different persons. Therefore, Śukra might be the son of Bhṛgu hy another wife, or he might be
the son of Kavi.</F> Kāvyamātā possessed extraordinary powers
of penance. In the Devī Bhāgavata the following story
is given; how she cursed Viṣṇu and how she made
Viṣṇu and Indra powerless.
<div n="NI"/>Once a fierce war was fought by the Devas and the
Asuras in which the latter got defeated, and they sought
the help of Śukrācārya. But, as the Devas enjoyed the
support of Viṣṇu, Śukra could not do anything for the
asuras, and he therefore advised them to get on some-
how or other for some time. After that Śukra went to
Kailāsa and performed penance, hanging head down-
wards, for a thousand years to secure rare and ex-
ceptional mantras. During this period the Devas again
attacked the Asuras, who ran up to Kāvyamātā for
succour, and she, by one glance, sent the Devas to
long sleep. She reduced Viṣṇu and Indra also to a
state of paralysis. Then Viṣṇu meditated upon the
Sudarśana Cakra, which arrived immediately and with
the Cakra he cut off Kāvyamātā's head. Sage Bhṛgu
then appeared on the scene and brought back Kāvya-
mātā to life, and she, in furious rage cursed that Viṣṇu
should take many births. As a result of the curse
Mahāviṣṇu had to incarnate himself on earth many
times. (Devī Bhāgavata, 4th Skandha).
