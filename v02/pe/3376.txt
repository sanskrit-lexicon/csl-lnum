KARŪṢA¦ (M). A place in ancient India. Historians
are of opinion that it is the Bundelkhaṇḍa of modern
India. The sin of Brahmahatyā (killing of brahmins)
of Indra was washed away by brahmins at this place.
The place where Karīṣa (cowdung) from Indra fell
was called Karīṣa and it gradually became Karūṣa.
(See under Aṅgamalaja).
