AKṢARAPURUṢA¦. When all was set for the Kuru-
kṣetra battle Arjuna showed signs of weakness and hesi-
tated to proceed for a fight. Śrī Kṛṣṇa then through the
famous Gītā enunciated a philosophy of life during the
course of which he speaks about the two puruṣas, Kṣara
and Aksara. All that we see in this world and enjoy are
Kṣara and the power behind all of them is Akṣara.
God is one who transcends the aspects Kṣara and Akṣara
and stands as the root cause of all life. (Ślokas 16 to 19,
Chapter 39, Bhīṣma Parva, M.B.)
