KULADHARMA¦. The moral and ethical codes of
conduct, especially with reference to family life. Arjuna
told the following about Kuladharmas to Kṛṣṇa at
Kurukṣetra.
<div n="NI"/>In the decline of a family, its time-honoured usages
perish; with the perishing of such rites impiety over-
takes the entire family.
<div n="NI"/>With the growth of impiety even the noble women
become unchaste, and if women become corrupt,
mixture of castes ensues.
<div n="NI"/>Hell is verily the lot of the family and family-destroyers
through caste admixture; for, their ancestors fall
deprived of balls of rice and libations.
<div n="NI"/>The ever-lasting caste virtues and the family merits get
ruined because of the chaos in the caste system.
We have heard that hell is verily the long-lasting abode
of the men whose family religious practices have been
broken. (Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 25 and the Gītā).
