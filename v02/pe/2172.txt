DURJAYA I¦. An absolutely cruel King. Owing to the
number of adharmas (evil actions he had committed)
Kāla ordained him to be born and reborn twentyone
times as various animals and as a Brahmarākṣasa he
roamed about forests. One of those days he caught
hold of a Śīvayogī called Mahādeva whose body was
smeared with Vibhūti (the sacred ash), but as soon as
the Vibhūti from the body of the Śivayogī got smeared
on his body also, Durjaya got back his former form
and he was lifted upto Svarga. (Śiva Purāṇa, Bhasma
Māhātmya).
