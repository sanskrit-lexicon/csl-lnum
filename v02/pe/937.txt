BĀṆA III¦. A warrior of Subrahmaṇya. Mention is
made about this Bāṇa in Mahābhārata, Śalya Parva,
Chapter 45, Stanza 67.
<div n="NI"/>BĀṆA IV. An asura. During the regime of Śrī Rāma
this Asura fought against the King and his brothers. A
Śivaliṅga had been consecrated in the throat of this
[Page107-b+ 63]
asura. So it was not possible for Lakṣmaṇa to defeat
him though he had fought with him for so many days.
Lakṣmaṇa heard an etherial voice saying, “Unless and
until the image of Śivaliṅga is removed from his throat
Bāṇa could not be killed.” By the operation of arrows
Lakṣmaṇa smashed the image of Śivaliṅga in his
throat. With the same arrow he cut the throat of the
asura also and thus Bāṇa was killed. (Kampa Rāmā-
yaṇa, Uttara Kāṇḍa).
