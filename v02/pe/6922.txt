SUDARŚANA¦ X. The son of Dīrghabāhu who was born
in the family of Manu. He conquered all the kingdoms
and ruled as an emperor. The famous hermit Vasiṣṭha
was his priest.
<div n="NI"/>Once Devī Mahākālī appeared to him in a dream and
said to him: “Very soon a flood will occur in the world.
So go to the Himālayas with your wife and the priest
Vasiṣṭha and stay there in a cave.” According to the
instruction of Devī, Sudarśana took everybody with him
and went to the Himālayas.
<div n="NI"/>The prophecy of Devī came true. The earth was filled
with water. This deluge lasted for ten years. After
that the earth resumed its original form and Sudarśana
returned to Ayodhyā. (Bhaviṣya Purāṇa, Pratisarga
Parva, 1, 1).
<div n="NI"/>It is mentioned in Kālikā Purāṇa that Sudarśana had
broken off a piece of a forest region of Himālaya and
taken it to his country and founded on it the city called
Khāṇḍavīnagara and that after a short period king
Vijaya of the Bhairava dynasty killed king Sudarśana
and became the ruler of the city. (Kālikā Purāṇa, 92).
