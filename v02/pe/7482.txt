TAMAS II¦. One of the three qualities of the soul. Sattva,
Rajas and Tamas are the three qualities. It is through
[Page785-a+ 64]
the union of these three qualities that the inner soul
enters the life of all animate and inanimate objects. The
attributes of Tamas are greed, sleep, bravery, cruelty
disbelief in god, bad habits, begging and indifference.
It is because of the action of tamoguṇa that one be-
comes a prey to lust. It is the worst result of tāmasic
activities that people are born as inanimate objects,
worms, insects, fishes, serpents, tortoises, cows and deer.
As a better result of Tāmasic activities people are born
as elephants, horses, Śūdras, barbarous people, lions,
tigers and hogs. It is the good result of tāmasic deeds
that produce pilgrims, good castes, egoistic people,
demons and devils. (Chapter 2, Manusmṛti).
