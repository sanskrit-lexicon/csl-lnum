JARATKĀRU I¦. A hermit who is Purāṇically famous.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} This hermit was born in a Brāhmaṇa dy-
nasty known as Yāyāvaras. He was the only son of
Yāyāvaras. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 13).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The name Jaratkāru.%} The meaning of the name
Jaratkāru is given in Bhāṣābhārata, Ādī Parva, Chapter
40, as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>“Jarā is consumption, Kāru is dāruṇa (awful). By and
by his body became hard and awful and by penance
he made his body to wear out, and so he got the name
‘Jaratkāru’.”
[Page348-b+ 65]
By means of penance he made his body lean and worn
out and so got the name Jaratkāru.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Marriage.%} The calm and abstemious Jaratkāru
remained unmarried for a long time. One day he
happened to meet with his Manes. They were holding
on to a grass and were about to fall into hell, and a
rat was cutting the root of the grass which was their
only hold. The moment the root is severed all the
Manes would fall into the deep ravine of hell. It was
at this juncture that Jaratkāru, met his Manes. The
moment they saw him they said, “See Jaratkāru, we
are your Manes. We have to obtain, heaven, life, con-
tentment and happiness by the good deeds of your
son. So go and get married quickly.”
<div n="NI"/>At first he did not like the talk about marriage. Still,
in order to procure heaven for his ancestors he agreed
to get married. But he made a condition that the name
of the bride also should be Jaratkāru and she should
be given to him as alms. Saying these words, he
walked away along the forest.
<div n="NI"/>News reached the ears of Vāsuki, the King of the
Nāgas (serpents) that the hermit Jaratkāru was
wandering through the forests calling out that somebody
should give him as alms a damsel named Jaratkāru.
Vāsuki had a sister. Jaratkāru was her name. Vāsuki
decided to give her to the hermit Jaratkāru. She was
adorned with costly garments and ornaments and was
taken to the hermit Jaratkāru. Jaratkāru said:—
<div n="NI"/>“Hear my condition, I will not cherish her if she
causes displeasure to me. If she does so I will send
her away instantly.”
<div n="NI"/>On condition that if she did anything displeasing to
him he would leave her at once, the hermit Jaratkāru
married Jaratkāru the sister of Vāsuki. (Devī
Bhāgavata, Skandha 2; Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva,
Chapters 13 and 47).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Leaves his wife.%} Jaratkāru lived in the hermitage
with her husband looking after him with love and
loyalty. One day the hermit was sleeping with his head
on the lap of his wife. Though it was sunset the hermit
slept on. It was time for the evening worship
of the hermit. If he is aroused he will get angry. The
wife was in a difficult situation. Anyhow she aroused
her husband. The hermit got up full of anger and
shouted, “You have hindered my sleep, you wicked
woman and teased me. So from today you are not my
wife. I am going away.”
<div n="NI"/>She begged him for pardon with tears. But without
paying any heed to the entreaties of his pregnant wife,
he left her.
<div n="NI"/>The helpless Jaratkāru gave birth to a son named
Āstīka who later stopped the famous sacrifice, Sarpa
Satra meant for killing the serpents. (M.B. Ādi Parva,
Chapter 47). See under Jaratkāru II.
