KAUSTUBHA¦. A brilliant precious stone. It is mention-
ed in Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 3; Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa
Bālakāṇḍa Sarga 45, Stanza 39 and Mahābhārata, Ādi
Parva that this precious stone floated up at the time of
the churning of the sea of Milk. This jewel which
originated from the ghee in the sea of Milk, was worn
on the breast by Viṣṇu.
“This divine jewel called Kaustubha came up in the
middle of ghee and stayed in the breast of Viṣṇu,
spreading its rays everywhere.” (M.B. Ādi Parva,
Chapter 18, Stanza 37).
<div n="NI"/>KAUTHUMI. Son of a Brahmin named Hiraṇya-
nābha. Once this Brahmin youth went to the hermitage
of King Janaka and entered into a controversy with the
Brahmins there. In the argument Kauthumi became
angry and killed a Brahmin. From that day he became
a leper. The sin of Brahmahatyā (murder of Brahmin)
also followed him. Finally according to the advice of
his father he worshipped the sun God, with Śrāvya-
saṃjñakasūkta (a spell or incantation) and by the
blessing of the Sun God he got deliverance from the
sin of Brahmahatyā and the disease of leprosy. (Bhavi-
ṣya Purāṇa, Brāhma Parva).
