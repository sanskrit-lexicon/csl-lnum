JVARA¦. (Jvaram) (Fever).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} A fearful being. It is stated in the
Purāṇas that living beings catch fever owing to the
activities of this monster.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The origin of jvara.%} Once Śiva and Pārvatī were
talking with each other in the Holy Bath called Jyotiṣ-
kam on mount Mahāmeru. On that day Dakṣa had
performed a sacrifice at Gaṅgādvāra. Śiva alone was
not invited. Seeing the Gods Brahmā and the others
going to that place through the sky, Pārvatī asked Śiva
what the matter was. Śiva explained everything to
Pārvatī, who became very sorry because her husband
had not been invited. Śiva grew uneasy at the sorrow
of his wife. A drop of sweat fell down from his third
eye. A fearful monster with the lustre of fire arose
from that drop of sweat. That figure is described as
follows:
<div n="NI"/>“A terrible monster, with dwarfish figure, staring eyes,
green moustaches, hair standing erect on head and
body covered with hair all over, looking like a combi-
nation of hawk and owl, with jet-black colour, wearing
a blood-coloured cloth.” (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chap-
ter 283).
<div n="NI"/>“With three legs, three heads, six hands and nine eyes,
comes Jvara the terrible monster, as fierce as Yama
the god of death and fearful like a thousand clouds with
thunderbolt, gaping and sighing, with tight body and
horrible face, rendered so by many eyes.” (M.B. Viṣṇu
Parva, Chapter 122).
<div n="NI"/>To this uncouth figure Śiva gave the name Jvara, who
dashed away and entered into all devas (gods). Brahmā
and the others caught fever and were laid up. At last
they all came to Śiva. Hearing their request Śiva
divided Jvara into several parts and separated them from
devas and entered them into other living beings, and
ordered that, headache for elephants, green coverings
for water, shedding of skin for snakes, hoof-rot for cows,
sore-throat for horses, feather-sprouting for peacocks,
sore-eye for cuckoo, hiccough for parrot, weariness
for tigers and fever for men will be caused by Jvara.
<div n="NI"/>It was the time of the terrorization of Vṛtrāsura. Jvara
caught hold of that Asura also. It was at this time
that Indra used his thunderbolt and killed Vṛtrāsura.

Chapter 122).
