CĀKYĀRKŪTTU¦. A very important art practised in
temples mainly in Kerala. It is called so because it is
exhibited by Cākyārs (a sect attached to temples). In
important temples a place called Kūttambala is set
apart for displaying the art. The Kūttu now prevalent
in Kerala temples is not exactly of its old form. Kula-
śekharavarmā perumāl (elected ruler of old Kerala)
effected some changes in the old art form, and Bhāskara-
ravivarmā perumāl and Tolakavi made further reforms
in it. The art of Kūttu was evolved with the object of
relating purāṇic stories in such a manner as will help
devotional feelings grow in man.
<div n="NI"/>The main aim of the Kūttu is to narrate purāṇic
stories in such a way as to instil Bhakti in the hearers
and to create an interest in them in the Purāṇas. The
Cākyār (the man who gives the discourse who usually
belongs to the Brahmin sect called Cākyārs) tells the
story in a very interesting way, reciting appropriate
passages from the Purāṇas and illustrating them with
apt examples and similes. The narration is from the
beginning till end humorous. The Cākyār who delivers
the discourse is usually a man with a good sense of
humour and a sense of what is odd, strange or eccentric
in nature and human character. There are three varie-

ties of Kūttu: Prabandhaṃ Kūttu, Naṃbiar Kūttu and
Kūṭiāṭṭam. Of these the first is narrative (Ākhyāna-
para) while in the second and third type, the element
of acting is more important (Abhinayapara).
