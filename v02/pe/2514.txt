GṚHAPATI¦. A sage. There is a story in Śiva Purāṇa
about this sage.
<div n="NI"/>Viśvānara father of Gṛhapati was living with his wife
Śuciṣmatī in a hermitage on the banks of the river
Narmadā. They had no children and Śuciṣmatī, was
grieved much on this account. She requested her husband
find out ways and means to get a child. Viśvānara,
[Page300-b+ 64]
went to Kāśī and did penance to propitiate Viśveśvara
and the God appeared before him and blessed him and
said: “You will soon get a son”. Very soon the wife
of Viśvānara delivered a child and the son was named
Gṛhapati. When the child was nine years old Nārada
came there once and warned them against fire. Viśvā-
nara immediately went and did penance to propitiate
Śiva and obtained from him for his son the qualities of
fire also so that fire would be unable to act on him. It
was on account of this that Gṛhapati when he installed
an idol of Śiva at Kāśī gave it the name of Agnīśvara.
