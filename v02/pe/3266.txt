KAPĀLĪ II¦. Śiva. The Mahābhārata gives the follow-
ing story regarding the reason for Śiva's getting the
name of Kapālī.
<div n="NI"/>Once a great controversy arose regarding the supreme
sovereignty of the three worlds between Brahmā and
Viṣṇu. Then there came to their midst an effulgence
of Śiva and a voice from heaven said “He who finds
the source of this brilliance is the real sovereign of the
three worlds”. Brahmā went up to find the upper end
and Viṣṇu went down to find the lower end. They
travelled for a very long time without finding the end
when Brahmā saw a Ketakī flower coming down. On
enquiry the flower said it was coming from the origin
of the brilliance and that three Brahmā deluges had
elapsed since its starting from there. Brahmā took that
flower and went to Viṣṇu. Viṣṇu asked Brahmā whether
he had seen the end of the effulgence and Brahmā said
‘yes’. Immediately the flower in the hand of Brahmā
turned into the figure of Śiva and cut off one of the
heads of Brahmā making five-headed Brahmā into four-
headed. The angered Brahmā cursed Śiva “May you
go begging with a Kapāla (human skull) in your hand.”
Thus Śiva became a Kapālī. Śiva cursed Brahmā back
saying “You will not be worshipped by anyone” (See
under Śiva, Brahmā).
