KUṆIGARGA¦. A reputed sage. By severe austerities he
increased his spiritual powers, created a girl by his
mental power, and afterwards entered into Samādhi.
The girl, who did not relish the idea of marriage, began
penance in solitude, and she grew old. In the Mahā-
bhārata she is known as Vṛddhakanyā (Old Virgin). In
the evening of her life she longed to give up her
material body and to attain salvation. At this juncture
Nārada told her that salvation was not for unmarried
women. She, therefore, gave half the power of her
penance to a young man called Śṛṅgavān and lived as
his wife for one single night. She thus attained salvation
(Śalya Parva, Chapter 52).
