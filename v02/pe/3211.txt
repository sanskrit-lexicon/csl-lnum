<div n="NI"/>2) {%Kaṃsa, an incarnation of Kālanemi.%} In the svāyam-
bhuvamanvantara Marīci had a wife named Ūrṇā and
they had six mighty and powerful sons. One day they
ridiculed Brahmā saying ‘A father who has married his
won daughter’ (Brahmā married Sarasvatī, his own
daughter). Brahmā became angry and cursed them to
be born as demons on earth. All the six sons were,
therefore, born as sons of a demon called Kālanemi on
earth. In their next birth they were born as sons of
Hiraṇyakaśipu. They led a pious life and pleased at
this Brahmā asked them what boon they wanted and
they demanded that they should not be killed by any-
body. Their father, Hiraṇyakaśipu, did not like his
sons getting a boon behind his back and so he cursed
his sons “May you all six go to Pātāla (nether-world)
and sleep there for a long time under the name of
Ṣaḍarbhakas. The sons begged for relief and Hiraṇya-
kaśipu said that they would after sleeping for a long
time be born to Devakī, wife of Vasudeva, as their
children and that Kālanemi, their father in their pre-
vious birth would then be born as Kaṃsa and kill the
children of Devakī by striking their heads on the
ground.
<div n="NI"/>Accordingly Kālanemi was born as Kaṃsa and he
killed the six children of Devakī by striking them on
the ground. (Skandha 4, Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>The 10th Skandha of Bhāgavata states “killing Kāla-
nemi born as Kaṃsa” when it refers to the killing of
Kaṃsa.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Another story regarding the birth of Kaṃsa.%} Kaṃsa
was not actually the son of Ugrasena. It was Nārada
who revealed to Kaṃsa the story of his birth. It is as
follows.
<div n="NI"/>Once when the wife of Ugrasena was in her menses she
went to the garden with her companions. Then a
Gandharva named Dramila disguised as Ugrasena
went to her but she knew the trick and cursed him
that he would go to hell. But Dramila committed rape
on her and then left the place making her pregnant.
When the child was born Ugrasena's wife greatly hated
the child got of an evil deed and cursed it saying that
the child would be killed by a member of the family
of Ugrasena. Thus Kaṃsa was the son born to the wife
of Ugrasena by the Gandharva, Dramila. It was because
Kaṃsa was aware of it that he behaved very badly to
Ugrasena and Kṛṣṇa. (10th Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%How Kaṃsa got Mathurāpurī.%} In olden times there
was a famous place called Madhuvana in the
river-base of Kālindī. The place got the name of Madhu-
vana because the demon Madhu was residing there.
[Page382-b+ 64]
Madhu had a son named Lavaṇa. Lavaṇa was a very
wicked demon always ill-treating the devas. Śatrughna,
son of Daśaratha, killed him and lived there establishing
a beautiful kingdom there. He named that place
Mathurā. After the death of Śatrughna two of his sons
ruled that country. Then when the Sūrya dynasty be-
came extinct the city of Mathurā came into the possess-
ion of the Yadu dynasty. It was ruled then by a very
brave and valiant ruler named Śūrasena. Vasudeva
father of Śrī Kṛṣṇa was the son of Śūrasena. After the
death of Śūrasena another King of the Yādava dynasty,
Ugrasena, became the ruler of the place, Vasudeva
accepting cow-rearing as his profession. Kaṃsa became
King keeping Ugrasena as a prisoner. (Skandha 4,
Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Vasudeva and Devakī are imprisoned.%} Vasudeva married
Devakī daughter of Ugrasena and sister, of Kaṃsa.
Kaṃsa pleased with his sister presented her with a
chariot. Kaṃsa, Vasudeva and Devakī ascended the
chariot and Kaṃsa himself drove the chariot. Then
from an unknown source above came a voice which
said “Oh King, know thou this and from this moment
chalk out thy plans for the future. The eighth son of
your sister will kill you for certain. You will be no
match against him.” (Chapter 1, Bhāgavata 10th
Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>Hearing this voice from heaven Kaṃsa got furious and
dragging his sister by the hair raised his sword to kill
her. Vasudeva then pleaded weeping not to kill Devakī.
Only the eighth child of Devakī was going to kill him.
Vasudeva would hand over all the children to him as
soon as they were born. Such arguments pacified Kaṃsa
and he left off Devakī without hurting her.
<div n="NI"/>Devakī delivered a son. He grew up under the name
of Kīrtimān and one day Nārada visited Kaṃsa and
told him that he was the incarnation of an Asura named
Kālanemi and the son who would be born to Devakī
to kill him was Nārāyaṇa. Kaṃsa, blind with fury,
killed Kīrtimān by striking him on the earth and im-
prisoned both Devakī and Vasudeva.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Man-hunt of Kaṃsa.%} Pralamba, Cāṇūra, Tṛṇāvarta,
Muṣṭika, Ariṣṭaka, Keśī, Dhenuka, Agha, Vivida and
Pūtanā were born in the Asura family as servants of
Kaṃsa. He sent them to different sides of the country
to torment the Yādavas. Many Yādavas left the place.
Even Kaṃsa's father Ugrasena, a great devotee of Viṣṇu
was teased.
<div n="NI"/>In the meantime Devakī delivered six sons including
Kīrtimān and all of them were killed by Kaṃsa by
smashing their heads against the ground below. The
seventh foetus of Devakī was aborted. (Instructed by
Mahāviṣṇu, Māyādevī invoked the seventh foetus of
Devakī and transferred it to the womb of Rohiṇī
another wife of Vasudeva. The child thus born to Rohinī
was Saṅkarṣaṇa or Balabhadrarāmā. Mahāviṣṇu then
entered the womb of Devakī instructing Māyādevī to
enter that of Yaśodā, wife of Nandagopa of Ambāḍi at
the same time. Śrī Kṛṣṇa was then born in the figure
of Viṣṇu. The watchmen were sleeping. Following
directions from the new-born child Vasudeva took the
child to Gokula and leaving the child there brought
back the child of Yaśodā and placed it near Devakī.
When the watchmen awoke and knew about the deli-
very of Devakī they immediately ran to Kaṃsa to tell
[Page383-a+ 65]
him. Boiling with rage Kaṃsa rushed to the side of
Devakī and taking the child by the legs raised it for
smashing it against the ground. The child to the fright-
ened dis may of Kaṃsa slipped from his hand and
rising up in the air said “Hi, ill-mannered wicked
Kaṃsa, do not waste your valour on women. Your
killer has already been born on earth. Do search for
him quickly.”
<div n="NI"/>Kaṃsa went pale with fright on hearing this and went
away to his palace.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Conspiracy of Kaṃsa.%} The thought that his killer
was born somewhere made him restless. He let off
Vasudeva and Devakī finding them innocent. Then he
sat sadly pondering over the future. The courtiers then
advised him to kill all the children who had been born
within the past ten days and that would include the
killer also. Kaṃsa accordingly sent to different parts
of the country his secret agents to kill all children, ten
days old.
<div n="NI"/>During this campaign Pūtanā, Śakaṭa, Tṛṇāvarta,
Ariṣṭaka and Keśī tried to kill Śrī Kṛṣṇa also but
Kṛṣṇa killed them all easily. For details see under each
head separately. (10th Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Kaṃsa is slain.%} Ariṣṭaka was one of the prominent
Asuras sent to kill Kṛṣṇa. He attacked Kṛṣṇa in the
form of an ox. Śrī Kṛṣṇa killed it without any diffi-
culty. Nārada who saw this incident informed Kaṃsa
about it adding that Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma were the
sons of Vasudeva only and the child who slipped out
of his hands was the child of Yasodā. Kaṃsa got furious
and he again imprisoned Vasudeva and Devakī and
brought to Mathurā Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadrarāma
and started thinking of ways and means to kill them.
Kaṃsa arranged to conduct a grand celebration of
Āyudhapūjā (worship of the weapons) and invited
Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma for the same among many other
gopas from Ambāḍi. He sent his chariot with Akrūra
to fetch Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma from Ambāḍi. Akrūra
privately informed Kṛṣṇa of the bad intentions of
Kaṃsa. Nandagopa and many others from Ambāḍi
started for Mathurā. When Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadra-
rāma started their journey in the chariot the gopas and
gopikās assembled there cried loudly. Some blamed
Akrūra.
<div n="NI"/>Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma reached Mathurā. There they slew
a huge wild elephant and the five Asuras, Cāṇūra,
Muṣṭika, Kūṭa, Śala and Kosala whom Kaṃsa had kept
ready to kill Kṛṣṇa and Rāma. Sitting on a platform
watching this, Kaṃsa became frightened and restless
and roared with rage thus “The sons of Nandagopa
should be instantly sent away from this palace. All
their wealth and all that of the gopas should be con-
fiscated. Bind with ropes the rogue Nandagopa, and
kill the wicked Vasudeva. Throw my father, Ugrasena,
into the river Kālindī bound hand and foot. Even a
father should be killed if he was a relative of one's
enemy.”
<div n="NI"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma boiled with rage when they
heard the orders of Kaṃsa and Kṛṣṇa, jumping on to
the platform pushed Kaṃsa down and jumping down
along with him killed him. (10th Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Other details.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Kaṃsa had married the two daughters of Jarā-
sandha named Asti and Prāpti. (10th Skandha, Bhā-
gavata).
[Page383-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Kaṃsa was a fierce bow-man. All the kings hated
him. Kaṃsa kept under him a crore of fighting men.
He had eight lakhs of charioteers and an equal number
of elephants. His army contained thirtytwo lakhs of
horses. (Dākṣinātyapāṭha; M.B., Sabhā Parva, Chap-
ter 38).
