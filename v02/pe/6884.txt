SŪCĪ¦ (NEEDLE). Iron needle is Purāṇically import-
ant. There is a story connecting the iron-needle of
Bhārata and Vibhīṣaṇa as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Having killed Rāvaṇa, Śrī Rāma anointed Vibhīṣaṇa
as the King of Laṅkā and returned to Ayodhyā. During
the reign of Vibhīṣana, Laṅkā reached the highest stage
of prosperity. Among the five metals, only gold
was seen in Laṅkā. At this stage Vibhīṣaṇa got an iron
needle from Bhārata. He kept it as a rare and valuable
treasure, in his palace.
<div n="NI"/>Vibhīṣaṇa who was an ardent devotee of Śrī Rāma used
to cross the sea, come to Rāmeśvara-temple and offer
flower at the feet of Śrī Rāma, every day. Flower was
brought in a big golden pot. Once Vibhīṣaṇa placed the
golden pot in the courtyard of the temple and went in
with the flower. After the worship, Vibhīṣaṇa came out
and taking the pot on his head returned to Laṅkā. Being
immersed in the thought of Śrī Rāma, Vibhīṣaṇa did not
look inside the pot. After reaching the palace he looked
into the pot and saw a Brahmin sleeping in it. He was
very pleased to see the Brahmin. So after welcoming
him with hospitality, he brought the box in which he
had kept the most precious treasure and placed it be-
fore the Brahmin who returned with the box to Bhārata.
He eagerly opened the box and saw only an iron needle
in it. The consternation of the Brahmin need only be
imagined.
