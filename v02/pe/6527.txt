SAVANA¦. I.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Son of Priyavrata who was the son of
Svāyambhuva Manu, by his wife, Surūpā. Surūpā had
ten sons including Savana. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha
8).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth of son.%} Savana married Suvedā, daughter of
Sunābha; but he expired before children were born to
him. According to the Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 72,
seven children were born from the dead Savana. The
story about it is as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Suvedā, heart-broken at the death of Savana, did not
permit the dead body to be burnt, herself holding it in
embrace. Then a celestial voice said to her: “Cry
not. If you are really chaste and true, enter the
funeral pyre along with your husband.” To this Suvedā
answered thus: “I cry because of grief that he died
before making me the mother of a son.” The celestial
voice said to her again: “You enter the pyre without
weeping. Your husband will have seven sons.”
<div n="NI"/>Sudevā now permitted her dead husband to be cremat-
ed and meditating upon her chastity she jumped into
the funeral pyre. But within minutes Savana came
alive out of the fire with his wife and rose to the sky
with her. He stayed in the sky for another five days
and on the sixth day had the sexual act again with
her. His semen dropped on earth from the sky. The
King then with his wife went to Brahmaloka.
<div n="NI"/>Samādā, Nalinī, Puṣyati, Citrā, Viśālā, Haritā and
Alinīlā, all of them wives of munis saw the semen in
the sky and when it fell into the water they thought it
was amṛta, which conferred eternal youth, and with
the permission of their husbands swallowed it. As soon
as they swallowed it their divine effulgence was dimi-
nished and their husbands, therefore, abandoned them.
Those women delivered seven children, who cried
fiercely and that sound filled the entire universe. Then
Brahmā appeared and asked the children not to cry and
also told them that they would come to be called
Maruts. Brahmā himself called them Maruts. They
were the Maruts of the first Svāyambhuva Manuvantara.
