GĀYATRĪ II¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} A glorious Vedic mantra. This
mantra has twentyfour letters. There are nineteen
categories of movable and immovable things in this world
and to this if the five elements are added the number
twentyfour is obtained. That is why the Gāyatrī has got
twentyfour letters. (Chapter 4, Bhīṣma Parva). At the
time of Tripura dahana Śiva hung this Gāyatrī mantra
as a string on the top of his chariot (Chapter 34, Karṇa
Parva).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The glory of Gāyatrī.%} If one recites Gāyatrī once one
will be freed from all sins done at that time; if one
recites it ten times all the sins done on one day will be
washed away. Thus, if one recites it a hundred times
the sins of one month; thousand times, the sins of a
year; one lakh times, the sins of his life time; ten lakh
times, the sins of his previous birth; hundred lakh times,
the sins of all his births, will be washed away, If a
man recites it ten crore times he becomes a realised
soul and attains mokṣa. (Navama Skandha, Devī
Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%How to recite Gāyatrī.%} It should be recited sitting
still with your head slightly drawn downwards with
your right palm open upwards, with the fingers raised
and bent to give the shape of the hood of a snake.
Starting from the centre of the ring-finger and counting
down and going up through the centre of the small
finger and touching the top lines on the ring, middle and
forefingers, count down to the base of the forefinger,
you get number ten. This is how the number of recita-
tions is counted. This method is called the Karamālā
(hand rosary) method. This is not the only method
that could be used. You can use a rosary made of
lotus seeds or glass beads. If you are using lotus seeds
you should select white seeds for the rosary. (Navama
Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
