VADHŪSARĀ¦. A river which flowed through the vicinity
of the hermitage of Cyavana. This river took its origin
from the tears of Pulomā, the wife of hermit Bhṛgu. (For
further details see under Cyavana). Because of a bath
taken in this river, the body of Paraśurāma shone with
radiance. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 99, Stanza 68).
