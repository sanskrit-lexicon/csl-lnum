PAÑCĀPSARAS¦. A lake of distinction. During the exile
of Śrī Rāma in the forests, Agastya showed Śrī Rāma
this lake and described its origin thus: “In times of old
a sage named Māṇḍakarṇi built this lake. This sage
living on air alone stood in the waters of this lake and
practised severe austerities for ten thousand years.
Devas were frightened by the rigorous penance of
Māṇḍakarṇi and they sent five devakanyakās (celestial
damsels) to the earth to entice the sage and stop his
penance. Tke sage was attracted by the divine beauty
of the girls and he lived with them in a grand building
constructed within the lake itself. Even after the passing
away of the sage and the damsels people used to hear
dance and music from inside the lake. Because five
apsaras lived in that lake it became known as Pañcā-
psaras.
