SANDHYĀRĀGA¦. The red colour seen in the sky in
the evening is Sandhyārāga. Rāgiṇī the daughter of
Himavān did penance to obtain Paramaśiva as husband.
The Devas took her before Brahmā, who said that she
was not able to bear the radiance of Śiva. Hearing
this opinion Rāgiṇī got angry and Brahmā cursed her
and changed her into Sandhyārāga. (See under Pārvatī).
