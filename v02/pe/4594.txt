MUDRĀS¦. When he recites the mantras a Māntrika
should use different kinds of gestures with his hands
to suit the recital. They are called Mudrās. The
Mudrās in general are given below:
<div n="NI"/>The first mudrā is called Añjalimudrā. Añjalī means a
cavity formed by folding the hands and joining the
open hands together. If the hands thus folded are placed
on the breast it becomes a Vandinī mudrā. The hands
should be placed on the breast with a slight slant to
the left for Vandinī mudrā. The third mudrā is called
Ūrddhva mudrā. Hold the left hand first in such a
way that the thumb comes on the top and then with
the fingers of the right hand bind the thumb of the
left hand. The thumb of the right hand should also
come to the top. This is called Ūrddhva mudrā. The
lowering of the left palm opened up is called Varāha-
mudrā. (Chapter 26, Agni Purāṇa).
