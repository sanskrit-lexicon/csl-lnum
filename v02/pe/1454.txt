CANDRASENA II¦. A king of Ujjayanī and a great
devotee of Śiva. As he performed great sacrifices and
gave away money and materials in gift to those who pray-
ed for them, an attendant of Śiva called Maṇibhadra
once gave him a gem, which possessed supernatural
powers. Attracted by the lustre and glare of the gem
many kings wanted to purchase it. But Candrasena
refused to sell it. Much incensed at the refusal, the enemy
kings set out to fight Candrasena, who then took refuge
in the Mahākāla temple in Ujjayanī the idol installed in
which was Śivaliṅga. Lord Śiva then appeared to him
and granted him salvation. (Śiva Purāṇa, Śaniprado-
ṣamāhātmyam).
