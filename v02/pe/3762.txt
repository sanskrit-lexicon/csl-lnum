KUJṚMBHA¦. A very powerful and valiant Rākṣasa
who possessed an iron rod named Sunanda. He had
earned the boon that the rod would lose its power
only on contact with women. He lived underground in
a thick forest on the banks of the river Nirvindhyā.
Once he abducted Mudāvatī, the beautiful daughter of
Viḍūratha, King of Vaiśālī. At last Vatsapri, the son
of Bhalandana made Mudāvatī touch the iron rod of
the Asura, which became powerless because of the
touch of a woman, and then he (Vatsapri) killed the
Asura. Vatsapri then married Mudāvatī. (Mārkaṇḍeya
Purāṇa, Chapter 116).
