VIMADA¦. A truthful King. Once a princess named
Kamadyū accepted Vimada as her husband at her
Svayaṃvara marriage. The Kings and princes who
were present became jealous of Vimada and prepared
for war. The helpless Vimada praised the Aśvinīdevas.
The gods defeated the enemies and gave the bride to
Vimada. (Ṛgveda, Maṇḍala 1, Anuvāka 17, Sūkta
117).
