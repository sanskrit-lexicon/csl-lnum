SUTAPAS VI¦. A hermit who was born in the dynasty
of Bharadvāja. This hermit had two wives. A son
named Kalyāṇamitra was born by Pitṛkanyakā, one
of the two wives.
<div n="NI"/>The glamour of the second wife of Sutapas attracted
the sun, who raped her once and from this, the son
Aśvinīsuta was born. On seeing that his wife was a
harlot, Sutapas abandoned her with her son. After-
wards, at the instance of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the hermit
received his wife and her son back. (Brahmavaivarta: 1:
11).
