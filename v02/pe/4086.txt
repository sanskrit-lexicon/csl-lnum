MĀGHA¦. A Sanskrit poet who lived in the 7th Century
A.D. The only work of his which has come to light is
Śiśupālavadha known popularly as Māgha.
<Poem>Upamā Kālidāsasya
Bhāraverarthagauravam /
Daṇḍinaḥ padalālityaṃ
Māghe santi trayo guṇāḥ //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>This is a very famous verse meaning thus: “The simile
of Kālidāsa, the depth of meaning of the words of
Bhāravi and the simplicity of language of Daṇḍin are all
present in Māgha”. This indicates how great a poet
Māgha was.
<div n="NI"/>From the last part of this Kāvya it can be surmised
that Māgha was the son of Dattaka and grandson of
Suprabhadeva. Suprabhadeva was the minister of a King
[Page461-b+ 64]
called Dharmadeva. Māgha was born in Gujarat. A
literary critic named Jacobi fixes the period of Māgha
as the 6th century A.D. while others fix it as the 8th
century A.D Māgha has made references to the drama
‘Nāgānanda’ written by Harṣa. Harṣa was a King
during the period 606 to 649 and that is why the
period of Māgha is fixed after that period.
