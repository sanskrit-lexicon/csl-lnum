JAYĀ¦. I. A daughter of the hermit Gautama. Gautama
had two daughters by his wife Ahalyā named Jayantī
and Aparājitā besides Jayā. While Dakṣa was perform-
ing a yāga, (sacrifice) this Jayā informed Pārvatī of
it. Pārvatī fell down when she heard that Dakṣa had
not invited Śiva to the sacrifice. Śiva got angry at
Dakṣa's negligence and from his wrath the Bhūtagaṇas
such as Vīrabhadra and others (attendants of Śiva)
arose. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter 4).
