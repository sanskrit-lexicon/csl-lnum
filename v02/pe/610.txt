ATIKĀYA¦. One of the sons of Rāvaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Previous Birth.%} This is a story concerning the initial
stage of the creation of the Universe. After completing
the task of creation Brahmā, in his pride fell into a sleep.
In order to slight Brahmā a little, Mahāviṣṇu produced
two Rākṣasas called Madhu and Kaiṭabha from his ears.
Hearing their terrible roar Brahmā woke up in fear and
fled to Mahāviṣṇu seeking refuge. Viṣṇu called Madhu
and Kaiṭabha and asked them what boon they
would like to ask. They proudly replied that they would
grant a boon to Viṣṇu. In that case Mahāviṣṇu wanted
them to grant him leave to kill them. They answered:
“We will not break our promise about granting the
boon. But since our passion for fighting has not been
abated, you must fulfil our eager desire.” Mahāviṣṇu
said: “I agree. But let my boon be carried out first.
After that I shall see that your wish is properly fulfill-
ed. After your death, one of you will be reborn under
the name of Khara and the other under the name of
Atikāya. In the Tretāyuga I shall kill Khara in single
combat after allaying his passion for fighting. Lakṣmaṇa
who is the incarnation of Ananta will fight with
Atikāya to his full satisfaction and kill him. Thus both
of you will get Virakti and Mukti.”
<div n="NI"/>After saying this, Mahāviṣṇu made the two asuras
stand on each of his thighs and killed them with his
Sudarśana Cakra. They were born again as Khara and
Atikāya. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} There is a story about the birth of Atikāya
in the Yuddha Kāṇḍa of Kamba Rāmāyaṇa: After
his victory over Kubera Rāvaṇa was returning in his
Puṣpaka Vimāna. On his way he saw some beautiful
Gandharva women playing in the valley of Mayūragiri.
Their leader was Citrāṅgī, the wife of Citrāṅgada.
[Page073-b+ 65]
Rāvaṇa seduced her and had a secret union with her. At
once she became pregnant and gave birth to a dazzlingly
bright baby. The mother handed over the child to
Rāvaṇa and returned to the world of the Gandharvas.
Rāvaṇa, in his paternal love, took the child into the
Vimāna and proceeded. On the way, the Vimāna
knocked against a mountain peak and the baby was
thrown overboard and fell in the forest. Rāvaṇa stop-
ped the Vimāna and made a search for the baby in the
forest. He found the child without the slightest injury,
smiling and lying on a flat rock in the deep woods. He
failed in his attempt to take it up even though he used
ten of his hands. The child began to grow steadily in
size. Then he tried again to lift the baby up using all
his twenty arms. The boy, who had by this time grown
into enormous size, suddenly sprang up and getting in-
to the Vimāna took his seat in it. Rāvaṇa gave him the
name Atikāya. On his arrival in Laṅkā, he presented
him as adopted son to the barren Dhanyamālā.
Atikāya was brought up by Dhanyamālā.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The Boons.%} Atikāya went to Gokarṇa and did pe-
nance to please Brahmā. Brahmā appeared, but being
fully absorbed in Samādhi, Atikāya was not aware of
his presence. Even his life-breath had been stopped.
Brahmā, by his power, instilled life-breath into him and
restored him to consciousness. He granted Atikāya all
the boons he asked for. They were three in number.
The first was the gift of Brahmāstra which could smash
anyone. The second was the gift of an armour which
was unassailable by anyone. The third was absence of
thirst, desire and other cravings.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Education.%} Atikāya went to Kailāsa and received
his education from Śiva. He learnt all the sciences,
Arts, Śruti, Smṛti etc. from there. On the completion
of his course he asked what Gurudakṣiṇā he should
pay. Śiva made him promise that he would never
practise Black magic. Pleased with him, Śiva awarded
him the Pāśupatāstra.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Victory in Battle.%} Atikāya had an uncle, a Rākṣasa
named Candra. Once he was defeated by Indra. It was
at this time of chagrin that he came to know that
Atikāya had reached Laṅkā with the Pāśupatāstra.
Candra Rākṣasa ordered Atikāya to bring Indra as a
captive. Atikāya went to Svarga (Heaven) and began
a war with Indra. Mahāviṣṇu who came to help Indra
used his Sudarśana cakra. Atikāya shot his Pāśu-
patāstra. Knowing Atikāya's history well, Mahāviṣṇu
brought the battle to a close. Both parties accepted the
position that Devendra had lost the battle and Atikāya
had won.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Death.%} In the Rāmāyaṇa battle Atikāya fought
on the side of Rāvaṇa. After a most terrible conflict,
Lakṣmaṇa killed Atikāya. (Kamba Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha
Kāṇḍa).
