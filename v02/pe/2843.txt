JĀMBAVATĪ¦. Daughter of the famous Jāmbavān. Śrī
Kṛṣṇa went in search of the famous precious stone
Syamantaka which was lost when Prasena wore it and
went to the forest for hunting. Kṛṣṇa found it in the
cave of Jāmbavān, who fought with him and was
defeated. Finally he gave his daughter Jāmbavatī to
Śrī Kṛṣṇa as wife, and the jewel Syamantaka as dowry.
<div n="NI"/>Śrī Kṛṣṇa came to his capital Dvārakā with his wife
Jāmbavatī. When sons were born to the other wives
of Kṛṣṇa she became sad and requested her husband
that sons may be born to her also. On hearing this
request Kṛṣṇa went to the mountain where the
hermit Upamanyu was engaged in penance. With that
hermit who was an ardent devotee of Śiva, as his
teacher, Kṛṣṇa began a penance before Śiva, in
accordance with his (Upamanyu's) advice. The
penance, holding yogadaṇḍa and Kapāla (devotee's
staff and skull) lasted for a month. In the second
month penance was performed standing on one leg and
drinking only water. In the third month he did
penance standing on toes only and using air as food.
After six months Paramaśiva appeared and blessed
him that his wives would have ten sons each. Accor-
dingly Jāmbavatī gave birth to her first son who was
named Sāmba. (Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 4).
