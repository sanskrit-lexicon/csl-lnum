GURUPARAMPARĀ¦. The origin of the Vedas and the
lineage of Gurus is given below:
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin of the Vedas.%} At the time of creation the
Veda was born from the face of God. It contained a
lakh of granthas with four pādas like Ṛk. From the
Veda were born the ten yajñas. The Veda was origi-
nally one. It was Vyāsa who divided it into four divi-
sions resulting in the four Vedas.
<div n="NI"/>Vyāsa divided the Vedas thus: When Brahmā command-
ed Vyāsa to divide the Vedas into divisions he first
selected four disciples who could see the end of the
Vedas. He accepted Paila to study Ṛgveda, Vaiśaṃ-
pāyana to study Yajurveda, Jaimini to study Sāmaveda
and Sumantu to study Atharvaveda. Besides these he
selected the highly intelligent Romaharṣaṇa alias Sūta
to study the Itihāsas and Purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>At first, the Veda was one. Vyāsa divided it into four.
He based the division on the cāturhotra, performance of
[Page305-a+ 64]
four hotṛs. He arranged the performance of Adhvaryu
as Yajus, that of hotṛ as Ṛks, that of Udgātṛ as Sāmans
and that of Brahmā as Atharvans. Then he separated
the Ṛks to form Ṛgveda, Yajus to form Yajurveda and
Sāmans to form Sāmaveda. He devoted Atharvaveda to
specify the rites and duties of Kings and the deeds of
Brahmā. Vedavyāsa thus split the single Veda tree into
four and from there arose later a forest of Veda trees.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The saints of Ṛgveda.%} Paila divided Ṛgveda into
two saṃhitās and gave one each to Indrapramati and
Bāṣkala. Sage Bāṣkala divided his Saṃhitā again into
four and taught it to four of his disciples, Bodhi, Ādimā-
ḍhava, Yājñavalkya and Parāśara. Indrapramati with-
out splitting his saṃhitā taught it to his renowned son,
Māṇḍūkeya. The branch of Indrapramati thus went
down into circulation through the disciples of Māṇ-
ḍūkeya and the disciples of the disciples and so on.
Vedamitra of Śākalya gotra, one sage in the line of the
disciples of Māṇḍūkeya, split the saṃhitā into five, and
taught it to Mudgala, Gomukha, Vātsya, Śālīya and
Śarīra. Śākapūrṇa a colleague of Vedamitra divided it
into three and added a division to it by composing a
Nirukta of his own. He taught them to Vaitālika,
Balāka and Krauñca. This was how the Indrapramati
Saṃhitā produced branches and sub-branches. Bāṣkala
divided his saṃhitā into another set of three and taught
it to Kālāyani, Gārgya, and Kathājava. The sages
mentioned above are the ones who spread Ṛgveda in
the world.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Saints of Yajurveda.%} Vaiśampāyana, disciple of Veda
Vyāsa, made twentyseven divisions of Yajurveda and
taught them to his disciples. Among those disciples was
Yājñavalkya, son of Brahmarāta. The branch Taittirīya
originated from Yājñavalkya.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The Taittirīya branch.%} Once all the sages learned in
the Vedas made a decision. He who does not attend the
Brahmasamāja meeting held at the mountain of Mahā-
meru will be tainted with the sin of Brahmahatyā
(murder of a brahmin). At one time Vaiśampāyana
was not able to attend and so was charged with the sin
of Brahmahatyā. He called his disciples to his side and
told them that they should observe a Vrata to absolve
Vaiśampāyana of his sin. Then one of his disciples,
Yājñavalkya, stood up and said that he would observe
the vrata alone and that there was no need of anybody
else in that matter. When asked why he said so he
replied that none of the colleagues of his was so bril-
liant and majestic as he was. Vaiśampāyana did not
like this arrogance of Yājñavalkya and so angrily
commanded Yājñavalkya to give back all that had been
taught to him by Vaiśampāyana. Obeying orders Yājña-
valkya vomited all the yajus and went away from the
place. The other sages taking the form of the bird,
Tittiri, accepted the vomited yajus. Therefore that
branch of the Veda got the name of Taittirīya and
those sages were known as the Taittirīyas.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Ayātayāma(s).%} On his leaving Vaiśampāyana
Yājñavalkya put into operation a new set of Yajus
called Ayātayāma unknown even to Vaiśampāyana.
This was how it happened. Yājñavalkya after leaving
the Brahmasamāja went and did penance to propitiate
the Sun-god. The Sun appeared before him in the form
of a horse. Yājñavalkya then requested him to grant
him new yajus unknown even to Vaiśampāyana.
[Page305-b+ 63]
The Sun then remaining in the shape of the horse
(Vāji) itself imparted to him instructions on a new
set of Yajus called Ayātayāma which were not known
to anybody else, even to Vaiśampāyana. Those who
studied it were called Vājis. There are fifteen branches
of the Vājis, Kānnu being one of them. All were put
into operation by Yājñavalkya.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%The Sannyāsins of Sāmaveda.%} Vedavyāsa taught Sāma-
veda to Jaimini. Jaimini had a son, Sumantu, and he in
turn had a son named Sutva. Sumantu and Sutva
were very intelligent and they studied one branch each
of the Vedas. Sutva had a son, Sukarmā, and he
divided Sāmavedasaṃhitā into a thousand branches.
Sukarmā had two disciples: Hiraṇyanābha and Pauṣ-
piñji, and both of them studied all the thousand
divisions of the Sāmaveda. The five hundred disciples
of Hiraṇyanābha who came from the north and studied
Sāmaveda were called Udīcya Sāmagas (those come from
the north). Another five hundred came from the east
and studied Sāmavedasaṃhitā from Hiraṇyanābha and
they were called Prācya sāmagas. (Hiraṇyanābha is
known as Kauśalya also.) Pauṣpiñji had four disciples:
Logākṣi, Kauthumi, Kakṣīvān and Lāṅgali. These four
and their disciples split their saṃhitās and increased
them. Kṛti, one of the disciples of Hiraṇyanābha,
taught his disciples twentyfour saṃhitās. They also
split them into many more and made the Sāmaveda
bigger.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%The saints of Atharvaveda.%} Vyāsa taught Atharvaveda
to Sumantu. Sage Sumantu taught it to his disciple
Kabandha first. Kabandha split it into two and gave
one each to his disciples: Devādarśa and Pathya. Deva
had four discīples: Medhā Brahmabali, Śāntakāyani and
Pippalāda. Pathya had three: Jābāli, Kumuda and
Śaunaka. All these made saṃhitās. Śaunaka split his
saṃhitā into two and taught one to Badru and another
to Saindhava. Muñjikeśa learnt it from Saindhava. He
split it into two first and then again into three. The five
śaṃhitās of Muñjikeśa namely, Nakṣatrakalpa, Veda-
kalpa, Saṃhitākalpa, Āṅgirasakalpa and Śāntikalpa are
the most important divisions of the Atharvaveda. The
Nakṣatrakalpa contains methods of worshipping Nak-
ṣatras; the Vedakalpa contains the rites of the Ṛtvik
Brahmā, and the Saṃhitākalpa contains the science of
the care of horses and elephants.
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Purāṇas.%} Vyāsa compiled a Purāṇa saṃhitā using
speeches, appendices, poems and Kalpanirṇayas and tau-
ght it to Romaharṣaṇa alias Sūta. Sūta had six disciples
named Sumati, Agnivarcas, Mitrāyus, Sāṃśapāyana,
Akṛtavraṇa, and Sāvarṇi. Akṛtavraṇa, Sāvarṇi and Śāṃ-
śapāyana born of Kaśyapagotra have themselves made
Purāṇasaṃhitās. There is another saṃhitā composed
by Romaharṣaṇa based on the saṃhītās made by the
above three.
<div n="NI"/>Viṣṇu Purāṇa is based on the latter four saṃhitās. There
are eighteen Purāṇas, namely, Āgneya, Brāhma, Brahmā-
ṇḍa, Brahmavaivarta, Bhāgavata, Bhaviṣya, Garuḍa,
Kūrma, Liṅga, Mārkaṇḍeya, Matsya, Nāradīya, Padma,
Śiva, Skanda, Vāmana, Varāha and Viṣṇu. There are
eighteen sub Purāṇas also. In all these are described the
creation, the deluge, the dynasties of the devas, history
of kingly dynasties, changes of generations etc. (Aṃśa
3, Viṣṇu Purāṇa; 12th Skandha, Bhāgavata).
