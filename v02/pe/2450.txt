GODĀNA¦. In ancient India it was believed to be a very
great deed of moral merit to give cows as gifts. If one
buys cows with the hereditary wealth and gives them
as gifts one would reach an ever prosperous world and
even one who buys cows with the money received by
gambling and gives them as gifts would live for several
years enjoying prosperity. (Chapter 73, Anuśāsana
Parva).
