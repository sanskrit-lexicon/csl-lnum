KĀKA¦ (CROW).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin.%} Kaśyapa was the son of Marīci, who was
the son of Brahmā. Kaśyapa's wife Tāmrā had many
daughters like Kākī, Śyenī, Bhāsī, Gṛdhṛkā, Śukī and
Grīvā. From Kākī were born the crows in the world.
(Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 19).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Crows—the symbol of sin.%} There is a reference in
Śiva Purāṇa to this. Long ago the King of Kāśī had a
daughter named Kalāvatī. Even in her youth, she
received the “Śaiva pañcākṣara mantra.” After that,
she was married by Dāśārha, King of Mathurā, who
was a sinner. When he touched Kalāvatī who was a
holy woman, he experienced unbearable heat. Kalāvatī
said that it was because of the King's sin. So she took
Dāśārha to the sage Garga, who purified Dāśārha with
his mantras (incantations) and made him stand in
water. At once the King's sins came out of his body
in the shape of crows. Some of them flew away. Many
of them fell down with their wings burnt. Seeing this,
the sage Garga said that all those crows were the
volume of sins accumulated in the course of the innu-
merable births through which he had passed. (Śiva
Purāṇa, Pañcākṣara Māhātmya).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The Crow and Rice-offerings.%} In Uttara Rāmāyaṇa
there is a story about the crow's right to eat the
offering of rice to Pitṛs. Once a King named Marutta
performed a Maheśvara sattra. Indra and other gods
attended the sattra. Hearing about this, Rāvaṇa came
that way. The frightened gods fled away assuming the
forms of different birds. Yama escaped in the form of
a crow. From that time, Yama was pleased with crows.
He gave a blessing that in future, when human beings
worship the piṭrs by offering rice to them, the crows
will have the right to eat that rice. Thus the right of
the crows to eat offerings of rice, originated from that
time. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
