ŚIKHIDHVAJA¦. A king, who ruled over Mālava during
the first Dvāparayuga in the seventh Manvantara.
Cūḍālā, daughter of the king of Saurāṣṭra was Śikhidh-
vaja's wife. The Jñānavāsiṣṭham contains a story about
how the royal couple renounced all attachments in life
as the result of intense tapas.
<div n="NI"/>Śikhidhvaja and Cūḍālā began practising jñānayoga
(communion through knowledge). It was Cūḍālā, who
gained Siddhis first. Though the king was pleased with
the achievements of his wife he felt sorry about his
failure or drawbacks. Cūḍālā had attained the Siddhi to
travel even in air. Though she told her husband empha-
[Page717-b+ 64]
tically that he could practise jñānayoga living in the
palace itself, he quitted the city for the forest and began
performing tapas there. Then on one day, she went
to the presence of the king in the forest in the guise of a
brahmin boy and stood there without touching the earth
with his feet. The king treated the boy with honour
and respect taking him for some Deva. Then she reveal-
ed her actual form, and the king agreed to return with
her to the palace and practise jñānayoga there. At that
juncture Cūḍālā created by her soul-power celestial
women like Urvaśī and also Indra and lined them up
before her husband. This was to test whether the king
yielded to any of the temptations by the celestial
women or by Indra and Cūḍālā returned with the king
to the kingdom.
