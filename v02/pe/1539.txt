CIRAKĀRĪ¦. A son of Gautama Maharṣi. He used to
think deeply before doing any deed and so he earned the
name Cirakārī.
<div n="NI"/>Once the sage Gautama found out proof against the
chastity of his own wife and enraged at this commanded
his son Cirakārī to chop off the head of the latter's
mother. Giving this command Gautama went into the
forest and Cirakārī in obedience to his father's order
came before his mother, weapon in hand. He did not
kill her immediately but pondered over the consequences
of the deed. Matricide is a great sin, he mused. Then
again who would be there to look after father if mother
died. Perhaps his father, when he cools down, might
regret his command and come back repentant. Thus
he was sitting undecided when Gautama returned full
of remorse for his hasty order. On seeing his wife

alive he was greatly relieved and immensely happy and
he blessed Cirakārī. (Chapter 266, Śānti Parva).
