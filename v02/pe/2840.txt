JAMADAGNI¦. A hermit of majestic power. He was the
father of Paraśurāma.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu in the following
order are: Brahmā—Bhṛgu—Cyavana—Aurva—
Ṛcīka—Jamadagni.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} There is an interesting story about the birth
of Jamadagni. Gādhi was the son of king Kuśāṃba. A
daughter named Satyavatī was born to Gādhi. The
hermit Rcīka giving a dowry of one thousand horses,
each with one black ear, married Satyavatī. Once
Satyavatī told her husband that herself and her mother
wanted to get a child each. After the sacrifice of obla-
tions to Agni (fire), Ṛcīka took two parts filled with
boiled rice and gave them to Satyavatī, with mantras
(spells). The radiance of Brahmā was invoked into
one pot and the radiance of Kṣātra was invoked into
the other. The hermit had asked Satyavatī to eat the
rice into which the radiance of Brahmā had been in-
voked and to give the other pot to her mother. But the
daughter and mother changed the pots secretly and
Satyavatī ate the rice in the pot into which Kṣātra radi-
ance was invoked and gave the pot of rice filled with
Brāhma-radiance to her mother. Both the women con-
ceived. As the child grew in the womb the radiance of
Brahmā shone on the face of the mother and Kṣātra
lustre was seen on the face of Satyavatī, Rcīka asked
Satyavatī for the reason. She admitted the secret inter-
change of the pot.
<div n="NI"/>Satyavatī and her mother both delivered at the same
time. Satyavatī got the son Jamadagni, who was the
embodiment of Kṣātra tejas and the child with Brāhma
tejas born to the mother was Viśvāmitra. Therefore, in
some Purāṇas Viśvāmitra is described as the uncle of
Jamadagni whereas in some others they are said to be
brothers. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 57).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%A house-holder.%} When Jamadagni grew up he made
a tour and visited the holy places one by one and
reached the palace of King Prasenajit of the family of
Ikṣvāku. He saw Reṇukā the beautiful daughter of
King Prasenajit and fell in love with her. He requested
Prasenajit for the hand of Reṇukā. The King, without
raising any objection gave his daughter Reṇukā in
marriage to Jamadagni. The couple came to the bank
[Page340-a+ 61]
of the river Narmadā and erecting a hermitage began
‘tapas’ (penance). Four sons, Ṛumaṇvān, Suhotra, Vasu
and Viśvāvasu were born to Jamadagni by Reṇukā.
(Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 58).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The birth of Paruśu rāma.%} Because of the wickedness
of the Kṣatriya Kings, the goddess Earth became
miserable. She made a representation to Brahmā who
took her to the sea of Milk and told Mahāviṣṇu every-
thing. Mahāviṣṇu promised to take an incarnation as
the son of Jamadagni and destroy all the wicked Kings.
Accordingly Reṇukā gave birth to Paraśurāma, who
was an incarnation of Mahāviṣṇu. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa,
Chapter 59).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Jamadagni getting the bow of Viṣṇu.%} Once the devas
(gods) desired to know who, of Śiva and Viṣṇu was
the more powerful. They informed Brahmā of their
desire. Brahmā asked Viśvakarmā to make two tremen-
dous bows. He gave one to Śiva and the other to
Viṣṇu. The bow which Viṣṇu got was known as Vaiṣṇa-
vacāpa and that which Śiva got was known as
Śaivacāpa. After this Brahmā caused enmity between
Śiva and Viṣṇu. A terrible battle ensued between Śiva
and Viṣṇu. After a while the Śaivacāpa became
less effective. At the request of the devas, the fight was
stopped. The devas decided that Viṣṇu was superior to
Śiva, in power. Śiva got angry at this decision and
gave his bow to Devarāta Janaka, the King of Videha.
It was this bow that Śrī Rāma broke at the marriage
of Sītā.
<div n="NI"/>Seeing that Śiva had given away his cāpa (bow)
Mahāviṣṇu gave his bow to his devotee, the hermit
Ṛcīka. That Vaiṣṇava cāpa was given to Jamadagni
by Ṛcīka. Thus the famous Vaiṣṇava cāpa arrived at
the hermitage of Jamadagni. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
Bāla Kāṇḍa, Sarga 75).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Reṇukā was killed.%} Paraśurāma became fourteen
years old. Jamadagni went to the forest to gather
fruits, roots etc. After completing the cleansing work
of the hermitage, leaving Paraśurāma in the forest,
Reṇukā went to the bank of the river Narmadā (Revā)
to fetch water. When she reached the river, Kārta-
vīryārjuna and his wives were playing in water. She
waited for them to go. When they were gone she got
into the river. But as the water was muddy because of
the play, she walked a little to the east where there
was pure water. She saw there Citraratha the King
of Sālva playing with his wife in the water. How
beautiful they were! She had never seen so beautiful a
woman or so handsome a man. She stood there looking
at them for a while. When she reached the hermitage
with water, Jamadagni had already returned a long
while ago. He had returned weary and tired of the
heat of the midday-sun. He did not see his wife in
the hermitage. He had been sitting very angry when
Reṇukā returned with water. She put the pot down
and bowed before her husband and told him the reason
for her being late. When he heard the reason his anger
blazed. He called his sons one by one and ordered
them to kill her. But the four elder sons did not dare
to execute his order saying that slaughter of a woman
was a great sin. But Paraśurāma came forward and
[Page340-b+ 64]
by a cutting-arrow cut off the head of his mother. The
father called the four sons who disobeyed him and
cursed them thus:
<div n="NI"/>“Since you have disobeyed the order of your father,
because of your ignorance, you shall become foresters
and live in forest.”
<div n="NI"/>Being overwhelmed with sorrow at the death of his
mother, Paraśurāma swooned and fell down. When
his anger subsided, discretion dawned on Jamadagni.
He aroused his son and took him on his lap and asked
him what boon he wanted for having accomplished
the unaccomplishable task. Paraśurāma's request
was that his mother should be brought to life again.
The hermit was pleased and he brought Reṇukā to
life again. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 60).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%The sun gave Jamadagni an umbrella and sandals.%} See
under the word Cerippu (Sandals).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%The temptation of Dharma.%} See under the word
‘Dharma’ Para 6.
<div n="NI"/>9) {%Jamadagni was killed.%} Once Kārtavīryārjuna, with
his minister Candragupta and some attendants had
been hunting in the forests on the banks of the river
Narmadā. It was noon. The hunters grew tired of
hunger and thirst. They came to the hermitage of
Jamadagni. The hermit called his divine cow Suśīlā
and ordered her to give food to the King and his party.
Within a few seconds meals were got ready for
thousands of people. The King and his attendants had
a feast. On their return journey the wonderful cow
Suśīlā was the subject of their talk. The King wanted
to get the cow which possessed divine power. So he
sent his minister Candragupta to the hermitage of
Jamadagni with instructions to get the cow Suśīlā in
exchange for a crore of cows or even half of the
kingdom. But the hermit was not prepared to give
the cow. The minister and his men caught the cow
by force and went away. The hermit, filled with grief,
followed the party a long way through the forest, and
requested Candragupta to return the cow. Candra-
gupta got angry and struck him to death, and took the
cow to the palace, in the capital city of Māhiṣmatī.
<div n="NI"/>After waiting for a long time, Reṇukā started in search
of her husband. She saw Jamadagni lying almost dead,
in a pool of blood. She fell down and beating her
breast cried aloud. Paraśurāma with Akṛtavraṇa and
other disciples came there. When she saw her son
Paraśurāma, she beat her breast twentyone times
<F>1) Seeing his mother beating her breast twentyone times, Bhārgava caught hold of her hands and said “Mother, stop
afflicting your body. Don't be sorry. I am here to end your sorrow. Since you have beaten your breast twentyone times, I will annihilate
the Kṣatriya Kings twentyone times.” Bhārgava Rāma took an oath thus, to his mother.</F>
and cried. Paraśurāma, took an oath that since his
mother beat her breast twentyone times and cried, he
would travel around twentyone times and put an end
to the Kṣatriya Kings. After that they took the dead
body of Jamadagni and placed it on fire, and began to
sing the song of Viṣṇu. Then the hermit Śukra came
by that way and with the help of Mṛtasañjīvanī
brought Jamadagni to life again. The lost cow Suśīlā
also returned without her calf. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa,
Chapter 69; M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 49).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Death of Jamadagni.%} Paraśurāma and Akṛtavraṇa
went to the city of Māhiṣmatī with the intention of
bringing the calf of Suśīlā back. They stood at the
gate of the city and challenged Kārtavīryārjuna for a
[Page341-a+ 63]
fight. Kārtavīryārjuna came out with his army. In
the battle which ensued, Kārtavīrya and his sons and
most of his warriors fell dead. Paraśurāma and
Akṛtavraṇa returned with the calf. Jamadagni asked
Paraśurāma to go to Mahendragiri and do penance in
order to mitigate the sin of killing a large number of
people. When Paraśurāma had gone for penance,
Śūrasena a son of Kārtavīryārjuna came with his men
to the hermitage, cut off the head of Jamadagni and
took it away. Paraśurāma and the disciples of
Jamadagni placed the dead body of Jamadagni on the
pyre and burnt it. Reṇukā jumped into that fire and
died. After this Paraśurāma began his twentyone
tours for the extermination of the Kṣatriya Kings.
