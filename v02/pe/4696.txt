NALAKŪBARA¦. A son of Vaiśravaṇa. He had a
brother called Maṇigrīva.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Cursing Rāvaṇa,%} It was the time when Rāvaṇa was
ruling over Laṅkā and terrorising the fourteen worlds.
As he was carrying on his conquests, once he came to
a round rock near Kailāsa. It was night. Rambhā had
fixed a rendezvous near the rock that night with
Nalakūbara. The full moon shone bright. The radiance
of the moon rendered Kailāsa and its vicinity most
beautiful. Filled with passion Rāvaṇa could not sleep
at all. In the silence of that calm night he heard the
tinkling of bangles. Rāvaṇa opened his twenty eyes
and looked in that direction. He saw an extremely
beautiful woman clad in splendid garments and orna-
ments going along the way. He ran to her and caught
hold of her hand. She was flurried and confused at his
sudden appearance. So she said, “Oh Lord! I am the
wife of Nalakūbara who is the son of your brother
Kubera. My name is Rambhā. Your brother's son is
your son too. So don't do any harm to your son's wife.”
But Rāvaṇa did not pay any heed to her words. He
lifted her up and placed her on the round rock and
raped her. Before dawn Rambhā, who had become
like the lake of lotus trodden by a mad elephant, went
to Nalakūbara and told him everything. Nalakūbara
[Page520-a+ 64]
became very angry and cursed Rāvaṇa. “You,
who have become blind with lust, shall not touch a
woman who does not reciprocate your love. If you do
so your head will be split into seven pieces.” It was
because of this curse that Rāvaṇa did not touch Sītā
though she was kept in his harem. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa;
Mahābhārata, Vana Parva, Chapter 28).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Another wife of Nalakūbara.%} It is mentioned in
Kathāsaritsāgara, Madanamañcukālambaka, Taraṅga
3, that, of the two daughters, Svayamprabhā and
Somaprabhā of Maya, Somaprabhā was the wife of
Nalakūbara.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The curse of Nārada.%} Nalakūbara and Maṇigrīva,
the sons of Kubera were playing with celestial maidens
in the Ganges in nudity, when Nārada came by that
way. The hermit was returning after visiting Viṣṇu.
The moment the celestial maids saw Nārada they put
on their clothes and stood aside bowing before Nārada.
Nalakūbara and Maṇigrīva did not see Nārada. They
ran here and there, playing with no clothes on. At
this, Nārada got angry and cursed them that they
would become two “Marutu” trees (Terminalia alata)
on the earth. They became very sad and requested for
liberation from the curse. Nārada told them they
would get liberation from the curse when they saw
Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the incarnation of Viṣṇu. Accordingly
Nalakūbara and his brother took birth near the house
of Nandagopa in Ambāḍi, as double “Marutu” trees.
It was the period of the childhood of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Once
Śrī Kṛṣṇa swallowed mud, and Yaśodā tied him to a
mortar. The child dragged the mortar to the Marutu
tree and got himself between the double trees. Imme-
diately the trees regained the original forms of
Nalakūbara and Maṇigrīva. They paid homage to
Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who blessed them, and both of them
returned to Vaiśravaṇapurī. (Bhāgavata, Skanda 10).
