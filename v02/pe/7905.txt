VAIŚVADEVA¦(M). A sacrifice. It is mentioned in
Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 11, that a brahmin should
perform this sacrifice to protect himself from hurts
caused by oven, threshing stone, axe, cutting knife, and
other weapons. This sacrifice could be performed in a
cavity for kindling fire on the floor besmeared with
cowdung and mud. It should not be done in an
ordinary oven meant for cooking, in iron oven, in
earthenware or on ordinary floor. As all the deities
are having faces of fire, the sacrificial fire should not be
kindled by fanning the flame with hand, winnow, hide
of black antelope or cloth. By fanning the flame with
cloth, the sacrificer will contract disease; by winnowing
he would sustain loss of wealth; and death, by fanning
with hand. Plums, fruits, roots, curd, ghee etc. could
be used as burnt offerings. When these are not avail-
able, firewood, roots of herbs, grass etc. could be used
instead. Things to be offered as burnt-offerings should
be purified, first by sprinkling ghee on them. In the
absence of ghee, milk, curd and water may be used.
Using things which are unfit as burnt-offerings will
invite bad results.
<div n="NI"/>In Vaiśvadeva-sacrifice, half-burnt firewood used in
cooking, should never be used. So also salts of any
kind. After finishing Vaiśvadeva, Gogrāsa (giving rice
to cow) also should be done.
