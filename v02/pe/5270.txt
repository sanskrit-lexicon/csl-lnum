PRAHETI I¦. A demon. Once Brahmā, the creator,
became hungry and in his anger he produced some
[Page595-b+ 65]
sounds which became Rākṣasas and Yakṣas. When
one said “Rakṣāmahe” the rākṣasas (demons) came
into being and when the other said ‘Yakṣāmahe’ the
Yakṣas came into being. It was Praheti who became
the father of the rākṣasas and Heti, the father of the
Yakṣas. Both of them became mighty and powerful
like Madhu and Kaiṭabha. Of these Praheti knew that
only by virtuous life could one attain happiness in the
next world and so remaining unmarried went to the
valley of the Himālayas and doing penance there
attained mokṣa. Heti when he came of age married
Bhayā, sister of Kāla, and got a son named Vidyutkeśa.
Vidyutkeśa married Sālakaṭaṅkā, daughter of Sandhyā.
The rākṣasa race born of them lived in Pātāla and
Laṅkā. In the Rāma-Rāvaṇa battle all were killed.
