very infancy he preferred learning the dhanurveda
(science of archery) to the other Vedas. While a
brahmacārin (Religious student) he performed tapas
and secured divine arrows. Afterwards, having been
overcome by the charms and appeals of an apsarā
woman named Jānapatī, Śaradvān had seminal
emission from which were born Kṛpa and Kṛpī. (For
