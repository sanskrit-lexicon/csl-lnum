YADU I¦. The founder of Yādava Vaṃśa or Yadu
Vaṃśa.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} From Viṣṇu were descended in the
following order:—Brahmā—Atri—Candra—Budha—
Purūravas—Āyus—Nahuṣa—Yayāti—Yadu.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Yadu Vaṃśa (Yādava Vaṃśa).%} The origin of Yadu
Vaṃśa is from Atri. Candra, Durvāsas and Dattātreya
Muni were the sons of Atri by Anasūyā. Budha was
born to Candra, Purūravas was born to Budha, Āyus
was born to Purūravas, and Nahuṣa was born to Āyus.
Two children, Āyati and Yayāti were born to Nahuṣa.
Yayāti had two wives, Śarmiṣṭhā and Devayānī. Three
[Page889-b+ 65]
sons, Druhyu, Anudruhyu and Pūru were born to
Śarmiṣṭhā. The Pūru vaṃśa takes its origin from Pūru.
Yayāti had two sons by Devayānī. They were Yadu
and Turvasu. The descendants of Yadu are the
Yādavas.
<div n="NI"/>Four sons, Sahasrajit, Kroṣṭā, Nala and Ripu were
born to Yadu. Sahasrajit had a son, Śatajit. Three sons
Mahābhaya, Veṇuhaya and Hehaya were born to
Śatajit. Of them Hehaya became famous under the
name of Ekavīra and founded the Hehaya vaṃśa. The
Hehayas and Bhārgavas were on terms of enmity.
Dharma was born to Hehaya, and Kunti or Kuṇi was
born to Dharma. Kuṇi had four sons—Sadājit, Māhiṣ-
mān, Bhadrasena and Durdama. Dhanaka was the son
of Bhadrasena and Dhanaka had four sons—Kṛtavīrya,
Kṛtāgni, Kṛtavarmā and Kṛtaujas. Of them, Kṛtavīrya
who was the eldest, was the father of Kārtavīryārjuna.
From here, Yadu vaṃśa continues from Kārtavīryārjuna.
He had five sons, Jayadhvaja, Śūrasena, Vṛṣabha,
Madhu and Ūrjjita. Vṛṣṇi was the son of Madhu, the
fourth of them. From this point, Yadu vaṃśa continues
from Vṛṣṇi. Yādava vaṃśa from this stage is also known
as Vṛṣṇi vaṃśa. Vṛṣṇi had four sons—Sumitra, Yudhājit,
Vasu and Sārvabhauma. Yadu vaṃśa continues from
Yudhājit. He had two sons, Śini and Nimna. Śini's son
was Satyaka and Satyaka's son was Sātyaki. Sātyaki
had another name, Yuyudhāna. Jaya was Sātyaki's son.
Kuṇi was the son of Jaya, Anamitra was the son of
Kuṇi and Pṛśni was the son of Anamitra. Pṛśni's sons
were Citraratha and Śvaphalka. Viḍūratha and Kukūra
were born to Citraratha. Śūra was the son of Viḍūratha.
Śini was the son of Śūra, Bhoja was the son of Śini,
Hṛdīka was the son of Bhoja. Four sons, Devavāha,
Gadādhanvā, Kṛtaparvā and Śūra, were born to Hṛdīka.
Śūra married Māriṣā and their children were Vasu,
Devabhāga, Devaśravas, Ānaka. Sṛñjaya, Kākānīka,
Śyāmaka, Vatsa, Kavūka and Vasudeva. Vasudeva
married Devakī, the sister of Kaṃsa. Śrī Kṛṣṇa was
their son. Pradyumna was the son of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Anirud-
dha was the son of Pradyumna and Vajra was the son
of Aniruddha. The last known link of that branch of
Yadu vaṃśa was Vajra.
<div n="NI"/>Kaṃsa also belonged to Yadu vaṃśa. Kukūra who was
the brother of Viḍūratha was the ancestor of Kaṃsa.
Ugrasena who was a lineal descendant of Kukūra, was
the father of Kaṃsa. The Purāṇas mention Devakī, the
mother of Śrī Kṛṣṇa as Kaṃsa's sister. But in fact she
was not his direct sister. Ugrasena, Kaṃsa's father, had
a brother named Devaka. This Devaka had three sons,
Devāpa, Upadeva and Sudeva. Devakī, Śrī Kṛṣṇa's
mother was the daughter of Devāpa. Devakī had six
sisters who were—Śrutadevā, Śāntidevā, Upadevā,
Śrīdevā, Devarakṣitā and Sahadevā.
<div n="NI"/>Akrūra who went to Ambāḍi also belonged to another
branch of Yadu vaṃśa. Pṛśni who was of the ninth
generation from Vṛṣṇi, had two sons—Citraratha and
Śvaphalka. Akrūra was the son of Śvaphalka.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Other details about Yadu Vaṃśa%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Once Yayāti wanted his son Yadu to transfer the latter's
youthfulness to Yayāti. The son refused to oblige the
father who therefore pronounced a curse that Yadu's
descendants would not enjoy kingship. (For detailed
story, see under Yayāti).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Yadu's descendants are called Yādavas. (M.B. Ādi
Parva, Chapter 95, Verse 10).
[Page890-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Yadu was the son of Devayānī and the grandson
of Śukrācārya. Although Yadu was a hero, he was dull-
witted. He did not obey his father. He used to despise
his father and brothers. His capital city was Hastinā-
pura. He became dull-witted after the loss of his king-
dom by the curse of his father. (M.B. Udyoga Parva,
Chapter 149).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%The end of Yadu Vaṃśa.%} Śrī Kṛṣṇa was one of the most
important members of the Yadu Vaṃśa. That family
continued only for 36 years more after the end of the
Bhārata Yuddha. At the end of the thirtysix years, evil
omens began to appear in Dvārakā. Whirlwinds began
to blow furiously. Frightened birds began to fly helter-
skelter. Rivers began to flow upwards. The whole land
was enveloped in mist. Comets continued to drop
from heaven, scattering sparks of fire. The sun's disc was
eclipsed with clouds of dust.
<div n="NI"/>At that time, one day, the sages Viśvāmitra, Kaṇva and
Nārada happened to come to Dvārakā. A band of
Yādavas, under the leadership of Sāmba, gathered round
the sages to make fun of them. They dressed Sāmba like
a pregnant woman and asked the sages what child “she”
would bear. The enraged sages replied that the “Child”
would be an iron pestle which would be the cause of
the death of all the Yādavas. Besides, they added that,
with the exception of Rāma, (Balabhadra Rāma)
and Kṛṣṇa, the whole of Yādava Vaṃśa would come
to ruin.
<div n="NI"/>Next day Sāmba did give birth to an iron pestle. The
frightened Yādavas recalled the curse of the sages. They
reported the matter to their king. The king, in deep
gloom, had the pestle filed into dust and ordered his
men to throw the dust into the sea.
<div n="NI"/>People recalled Gāndhārī's curse on Śrī Kṛṣṇa after the
Bhārata Yuddha. The curse was that the family of Śrī
Kṛṣṇa who was the cause of all mischief, would be wiped
out within a period of 36 years.
<div n="NI"/>At that time, women began to be stolen from Dvārakā
every night by a dark woman monster. Śrī Kṛṣṇa's
weapon, Cakra slipped out of Kṛṣṇa's grip and rose up
to heaven, in the very presence of the Vṛṣṇis. Seeing
these evil omens, the alarmed Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas
began to leave the place on a pilgrimage. They reached
the shore of Prabhāsa tīrtha. The Uddhavas parted
company with the Yādavas there. Nobody prevented
the Uddhavas. Śrī Kṛṣṇa who saw that the end of the
Yādavas was approaching, also kept silent. The Yādava
leaders in despair, took to drinking. Intoxicated by
drinking they began to quarrel. The particles of the
iron pestle thrown into the sea, were carried and deposit-
ed on the shore by the waves. They began to sprout in-
to a kind of grass. The blades of this grass soon trans-
formed themselves into iron pestles. The Yādavas pulled
them out and began attacking each other with them.
Most of them were beaten to death by their own kins-
folk. Śrī Kṛṣṇa who was in a state of trance in
“Yogāsana”, was hit on his toe by an arrow shot by a
hunter and he fell into Samādhi. Balabhadra Rāma
renounced his body and went to Pātāla.
<div n="NI"/>After that the sea advanced and submerged the whole
of Dvārakā. (M.B. Mausala Parva).
