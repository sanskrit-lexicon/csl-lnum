NĀGALOKA¦. The world of the Nāgas or Pātāla. Vāsuki
is its chief. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 127, Verse 60). There
is a pond in Nāgaloka and a drink of its water bestows
the strength of a thousand elephants. (Ādi Parva,

away from earth. Its area exceeds a thousand yojanas,
and it is surrounded by magnificent forts studded with
gems. The steps at the entrance of the fort are also

gardens, fountains and singing birds in Pātāla. Its outer
doors are hundred yojanas in length and five in width.
