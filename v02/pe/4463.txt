MAUDGALYA¦ (MAUDGALA). A maharṣi. This
maharṣi once cursed Rāvaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Once Maudgalya was sitting in Svastikāsana resting his
shoulders on his yogic staff in the forest of Kadamba.
Rāvaṇa returning after his victory march came that way.
Seeing the sage sitting in a wonderfully queer posture
[Page494-b+ 65]
Rāvaṇa was amused and playfully tapped the staff
with his Candrahāsa. The staff broke into two and
Maudgalya fell flat on the ground breaking his spine.
The sage was furious and he cursed Rāvaṇa saying
that his Candrahāsa would thenceforth have no effect
at all. (Yuddha Kāṇḍa, Kamba Rāmāyaṇa).
