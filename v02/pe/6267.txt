ŚARABHAṄGA¦. A Maharṣi, who lived in the Daṇḍaka
forest during the ‘forest-life’ of Śrī Rāma. (Vālmīki
Rāmāyaṇa, Araṇyakāṇḍa, Canto IV). When Śrī
Rāma visited Śarabhaṅga's āśrama, Indra too came
there, but went away saying that he would meet the
maharṣi after the great mission of Rāma was over. The
maharṣi told Rāma that he was waiting to see him and
did not accompany Indra to Devaloka as he wanted to
go there only after seeing Rāma. Rāma answered the
Maharṣi that he would take upon himself all the
spiritual assets and good results of the actions of the
Maharṣi, and wanted him to point out a place for
them (Rāma and others) to live. Śarabhaṅga directed
them to the āśrama of Sutīkṣṇa, and after that ended
his life by leaping into the fire and attained Brahmaloka.
