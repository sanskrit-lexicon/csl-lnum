CAMPŪ¦. A literary form of presenting a story in a
mixture of prose and verse, and abounding in beauti-
ful descriptions: “Gadyapadyamayaṃ kāvyaṃ Cam-
pūrityabhidhīyate”. Over and above prose and verse
the Campūs use daṇḍakas (very long, involved and
poetical prose). This literary form had its origin
first in Sanskrit and other Indian languages adopted it
with some variations. For instance, though prose in
Sanskrit Campūs is really prose, that in Malayalam
is something akin to metrical prose. There are more
than two hundred Campūs in Malayalam. The most
famous of the Campū writers in Malayālam are
Punam Namboothiri, Mahāmaṅgalam Namboothiri
and Nīlakaṇṭha.
