KARDAMA I¦. A Prajāpati. Pulaha, son of Brahmā, be-
got of his wife Kṣamā three sons named Kardama,
Urvarīyān and Sahiṣṇu. (Chapter 10, Aṃśa 1, Viṣṇu
Purāṇa). Of these three Kardama married Devahūti.
Devahūti was the daughter of Svāyambhuva Manu and
sister of Ākūti and Prasūti. (8th Skandha, Devī Bhāga-
vata).
<div n="NI"/>Devahūti was an ideal wife and served her husband
with great devotion. Kardama was pleased with his
wife and presented her with an aeroplane. Kardama
and Devahūti conducted then a tour of the worlds in
that plane. Devahūti delivered nine daughters and a
son. The daughters were married to Marīci and other
sages and the son grew into the celebrated Sage
Kapilācārya. Kardama then entered into Samādhi.
(Sitting in yoga and courting death of one's own
accord). (3rd Skandha, Bhāgavata).
