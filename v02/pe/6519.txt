SAURABHĪ¦. A cow which was the daughter of Surabhi.
Having drunk too much of celestial honey (amṛta)
which is the essence of the six tastes (ṣaḍrasas), Brahmā
had to vomit, on which occasion, the cow Surabhi
sprang up from his face. Her milk having accumulated
in a low place the milk-sea was formed. The hermits
known as the Phenapas live on the shore of the milk
sea, the foam that settles on the shore being their food.
Around them, there are four cows which protect the
four directions. Saurabhī is one of them. She supports
the east. Haṃsikā bears the south, Subhadrā the west
and Dhenu the north. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter
102).
