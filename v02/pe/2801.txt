ĪŚVARA¦. Once Devī told Himavān who, according to
the Hindu religion, God is, and how creation takes
place from Īśvara (God). The famous discussion about
Godhood, called Devīgītā is quoted hereunder.
<Poem>(1) Ahamevāsa pūrvaṃ tu
nānyad kiṃcit nagādhipa /
Tadātmarūpaṃ cit saṃvit
Parabrahmaikanāmakam. //</Poem>
(Before the creation of the universe commenced, I alone
was; there was nothing else. Then I was called Para-
brahman, Citsvarūpī, Saṃvitsvarūpī and Ātmarūpī).
<Poem>(2) Apratarkyamanirdeśya-
manaupamyamanāmayam /
Tasya kācit svataḥ siddhā
śaktirmāyeti viśrutā //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>(That form is beyond discussion (Apratarkyam); beyond
description (Anirdeśyam); incapable of being
compared (Anaupamyam); beyond birth, death youth,
old age etc. (Anāmayam). In this form of mine resides
māyāśakti.
<Poem>(3) Na satī śā nāsatī sā-
nobhayātmā virodhataḥ /
Etadvilakṣaṇā kācid-
vastubhūtāsti sarvadā //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>(That māyāśakti cannot be said to be existing or not
existing. Thus it is neither existing nor not existing.
The statement existing and not existing is subject to the
error, paradox. That great force exists always in me
with the pair of aspects.
<Poem>(4) Pāvakasyoṣṇateveya-
muṣṇāṃśoriva dīdhitiḥ /
Candrasya candrikeveyaṃ
Mameyaṃ sahajā dhruvā //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>(Fire does not exist without heat, nor Sun without light
nor Moon without its rays. Just like this, that māyāśakti
is coeval with me. It is permanent.
<Poem>(5) Tasyāṃ karmāṇi jivānāṃ
Jīvāḥ Kālāśca sañcare /
Abhedena vilīnāḥ syuḥ
Suṣuptau vyavahāravat //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>(Just as all actions, feelings and even the sense of time
remain latent in deep sleep, even so all the actions and
emotions of all living beings lie absorbed in Māyā).
<Poem>(6) Svaśakteśca samāyogā-
dahaṃ bījātmatāṃ gatā /
Svādhārāvaraṇāttasya-
doṣatvaṃ ca samāgatam //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>(I am myself the source of this Māyā; but it has a
strange power called āvaraṇa which hides my real
nature).
<Poem>(7) Caitanyasya samāyogād
nimittatvaṃ ca kathyate /
Prapañcapariṇāmācca
Samavāyitvamucyate //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>(Being joined to Caitanya (Brahman) Māyā becomes
the material as well as the immediate cause of the uni-
verse (Prapañca).
<Poem>(8) Kecittām tapa ityāhu-
stamaḥ kecijjaḍāṃ pare /
Jñānaṃ māyāṃ pradhānaṃ ca
prakṛtiṃ śaktimapyajām //</Poem>
[Page333-a+ 65]
(This māyā is referred to differently by different people
as tapas, tamas, jaḍa, jñāna, māyā, pradhāna, prakṛti
and ajā.).
<Poem>(9) Vimarśa iti tāṃ prāhuḥ
Śaivaśāstraviśāradāḥ /
avidyāmitare prāhur-
vedatatvārthacintakāḥ //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>(Experts in Śaiva philosophical thought refer to this
māyā as vimarśa and Vedic seers call it avidyā).
<Poem>(10) Evam nānāvidhāni syuḥ
nāmāni nigamādiṣu /
tasyāḥ jaḍatvaṃ dṛśyatvāt
jñānanāśāttato'satī //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>(Thus Vedas refer to māyā by various names. Because
of visibility māyā is called jaḍa, and because it is des-
tructive of true knowledge it is called asat).
<Poem>(11) Caitanyasya na dṛśyatvaṃ
dṛśyatve jaḍameva tat /
svaprakāśaṃ ca caitanyaṃ
na pareṇa prakāśitam //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>(Caitanya (Effulgence) is not visible. What is seen is
jaḍa (material expression). Caitanya is self-illuminating;
it is not illuminated by something else).
<Poem>(12) Anavasthādoṣasatvā-
nna svenāpi prakāśitam /
Karmakartṛvirodhaḥ syāt-
tasmāttaddīpavat svayam //
(13) Prakāśamānamanyeṣāṃ
Bhāsakaṃ viddhi parvata /
ata eva ca nityatvaṃ
Siddhaṃ samvittanormama //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>(If Caitanya is not self-illuminating then it is subject
to the drawback of Anavasthādoṣa (Absence of finality).
If Caitanya does not possess the quality of light and
illumination there should necessarily be something else,
which illuminates it, and there should again be something
to illuminate that which illuminates Caitanya. And, it
continues ad infinitum. This state of no conclusion is
called anavasthā doṣa. Also one thing cannot be, at the
same time, the subject (actor) and the object of action,
and that invites the draw-back of paradox. Therefore,
O King of mountains! understand that Caitanya
is self-illuminating and it illuminates other things by its
own illumination. And this, therefore, proves that my
Caitanya is eternal).
<Poem>(14) Jāgratsvapnasuṣuptyādau
dṛśyasya vyabhicārataḥ /
saṃvido vyabhicāraśca
nānubhūtosti karhicit //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>(All visible things go on changing in the three states of
awaking, dream and deep sleep. But, like visible things
Caitanya is not subject to change, and does not experi-
ence the three states).
<Poem>(15) Yadi tasyāpyanubhāva-
starhyayaṃ yena sākṣiṇā /
anubhūtaḥ sa evātra
śiṣṭaḥ saṃvidvapuḥ purā //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>(If it is argued that it (Caitanya) experiences the three
states then there must be something else as ‘witness’ for
the experience. But, since it is established as self-illumi-
nating there cannot be something else as ‘witness’.
<Poem>(16) Ata eva ca nityatvaṃ
proktaṃ sacchāstrakovidaiḥ /
ānandarūpatā cāsyāḥ
parapremāspadatvataḥ //</Poem>
[Page333-b+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>(Because of the above reasons experts in the science
of philosophy hold that this Caitanya is eternal, and
that, since it is the basis of bhakti which assumes the
form of absolute love, it is ānandarūpa).
<Poem>(17) Mā na bhūvaṃ hi bhūyāsa-
miti premātmani sthitaṃ /
sarvasyānyasya mithyātvā-
dasaṃgatvaṃ sphuṭaṃ mama //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>(No living souls think ‘I am not’. Every body cherishes
always his self-importance, the ‘I’. It is present there
in every living soul in the form of love. This fact itself
proves that I am different from all material objects).
<Poem>(18) Aparicchinnatāpyeva-
mata eva matā mama /
tacca jñānaṃ nātmadharmo
dharmatve jaḍatātmanaḥ //</Poem>
(That I am indivisible is quite definite. Knowledge is
not an attribute of the soul (ātman) but is the very
form of the soul itself. If knowledge were only an attri-
bute of the soul it (soul) should have been material
(jaḍa) and it is quite a certitude that the soul is not
material, because knowledge is the very nature of the
soul).
<Poem>(19) Jñānasya jaḍaśeṣatvaṃ
na dṛṣṭam na ca saṃbhavi /
Ciddharmatvaṃ tathā nāsti
Ciraścid nahi bhidyate //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>(The soul is pure knowledge without any touch of the
jaḍa. It is also pure existence. It is one and indivisible).
<Poem>(20) Tasmādātmā jñānarūpaḥ
sukharūpaśca sarvadā /
satyaḥ pūrṇopyasaṃgaśca
dvaitajālavivarjitaḥ //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>(The ātman (soul) is therefore jñānarūpa (of the nature of
pure knowledge), Sukharūpa (of the nature of pure joy)
and satyarūpa (of the nature of absolute truth). It is
unattached to anything and free from duality).
<Poem>(21) Sa punaḥ kāmakarmādi-
yuktayā svīyamāyayā /
pūrvānubhūtasaṃskārāt
kālakarmavipākataḥ //
(22) Avivekācca tattvasya
sisṛkṣāvān prajāyate /
abuddhipūrvaḥ sargo'yaṃ
kathitaste nagādhipa //
(23) Etaddhi yanmayā proktaṃ
mama rūpamalaukikam /
avyākṛtaṃ tadavyaktaṃ

(24) Procyate sarvaśāstreṣu
sarvakāraṇakāraṇam

saccidānandavigraham //
(25) Sarvakarmaghanībhūta-
micchājñānakriyāśrayam /
hrīṃkāramantravācyaṃ ta-
dādi tatvaṃ taducyate //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>(Impelled by the Vāsanās of previous actions the Māyā-
śakti proceeds to create the world, beginning with the
24 tattvas. My form which is immaterial and unmani-
fested is praised by all śāstras to be the cause of all
causes and the basis of all tattvas. It is also the basis of
all knowledge, action and volition and realizable only
through the hrīṃkāra mantra).
[Page334-a+ 64]
<Poem>(26) Tasmādākāśa utpannaḥ
śabdatanmātrarūpakaḥ /
bhavet sparśātmako vāyus-
tejorūpātmakaṃ punaḥ //
(27) Jalaṃ rasātmakaṃ paścāt—
tato gandhātmikā dharā /

(30) Sarvātmakaṃ tat saṃproktaṃ
sūkṣmadeho'yamātmanaḥ /
avyaktaṃ kāraṇo dehaḥ
sa coktaḥ pūrvameva hi //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>(From this primordial principle the five elements
(pañcabhūtas) were born. The first of these is ether
which is the element of sound because sound travels
through ether (śabda-tanmātra-rūpa). Then air (vāyu)
gave rise to the sense of touch and so air is called
sparśarūpa. This vāyu again gave rise to Agni (Vāyo-
ragniḥ). Then came water which corresponds to the
sense of taste (rasarūpa). From water came earth which
is gandharūpa (the source of smell) (Udakādbhūmiḥ).
Ākāśa (ether) has only one guṇa, namely sound. Vāyu
(air) has two guṇas—Sabda and Sparśa (Sound and
touch). Agni has three guṇas:—rūpa, śabda and sparśa.
Jalaṃ (water) has four guṇas—śabda, sparśa, rūpa, and
rasa. The last element—earth—has five guṇas—śabda,
sparśa, rūpa, rasa and gandha. From these five tanmā-
trās is born the liṅga-śarīra or sūkṣma-śarīra).
<Poem>(31) Yasmin jagadbījarūpaṃ
sthitaṃ liṅgodbhavo yataḥ /
tataḥ sthūlāni bhūtāni
pañcīkaraṇamārgataḥ //
(32) Pañcasaṃkhyāni jāyante
tatprakārastvathocyate /
pūrvoktāni ca bhūtāni
pratyekaṃ vibhajeddvidhā //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>(The jagat (universe) remained in embryo form (bīja-
rūpa) in these pañcatanmātrās. Then by the process of
Pañcīkaraṇa all the gross material objects were created.
These pañcabhūtas were first divided into two (each
was divided into two). Then by a process of the combi-
nation of these ten parts different substances were born
as detailed in the following stanzas.
<Poem>(33) Ekaikaṃ bhāgamekasya
caturdhā vibhajed gire /
svasvetaradvitīyāṃśe
yojanāt pañca pañca te //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>(Each half of each of these five bhūtas is again subdi-
vided into four parts. These 1/8 parts are joined to
the other halves and by combining them in other fractions
the material bodies (sthūlaśarīras) of all beings are
made).
<Poem>(34) Tatkāryaṃ ca virāṭ dehaḥ
sthūladeho yamātmanaḥ /
pañcabhūtasthasatvāṃśaiḥ
śrotrādīnāṃ samudbhavaḥ //</Poem>
[Page334-b+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>Virāṭdeha (Cosmic body) is the sum total of these indi-
vidual material bodies. The inner conscience and bodily
organs like ear etc. originate from the gentle and pure
aspects of the five elements.
<Poem>(35) Jnānendriyāṇām rājendra!
pratyekaṃ militaistu taiḥ /
antaḥkaraṇamekaṃ syād
vṛttibhedāccaturvidham //
(36) Yadā tu saṃkalpavikalpakṛtyaṃ

syād buddhisaṃjñaṃ ca yadā pravetti
suniścitaṃ saṃśayahīnarūpam //
(37) Anusandhānarūpaṃ ta-
ccittaṃ ca parikīrtitam /
ahaṃ kṛtyātmavṛttyā tu
tadahaṃkāratāṃ gatam </Poem>
<div n="NI"/>(Antaḥkaraṇa, due to differences in state assumes four
forms. When once conception and doubt arise in a
subject, then it is called mind. When there is no doubt,
but there is assuredness it is called understanding
(buddhi). The function of examining a subject again
and over again belongs to citta. To think of ‘I’ is
egoism or ahaṃkāra).
<Poem>(38) Teṣāṃ rajoṃśairjātāni
Kramāt karmendriyāṇi ca /
pratyekaṃ militaistaistu
prāṇo bhavati pañcadhā //
(39) Hṛdi prāṇo gude'pāno
nābhisthastu samānakaḥ /
kaṇṭhadeśepyudānassyād-
vyānaḥ sarvaśarīragaḥ // </Poem>
<div n="NI"/>(From the coarse (rājasic) aspects of the five sense-
organs originate the five organs of action like word,
foot, hand, excretory and the genital organ, and also
the five prāṇas (breaths) called prāṇa, apāna, samāna,
udāna and vyāṇa. Prāṇa is located in the heart, apāna
in the anus, samāna in the nābhi (navel) udāna in the
throat and vyāna all over the body).
<Poem>(40) Jñānendriyāṇi pañcaiva
pañcakarmendriyāṇi ca /
prāṇādi pañcakaṃ caiva
dhiyā ca sahitam manaḥ //
(41) Etat sūkṣmaśarīraṃ syān
mama liṅgaṃ yaducyate /
Tatra yā prakrtiḥ proktā
sā rājan dvividhā smṛtā //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>(Organs of knowlege 5, of actions 5, and prāṇas 5, and
buddhi 1, mind 1, the body is composed of these 17
factors). This forms the Sūkṣmaśarīra whose prakṛti
is two-fold (as mentioned below).
<Poem>(42) Satvātmikā tu māyā syād-
avidyā guṇamiśritā /
svāśrayaṃ yā tu saṃrakṣet
sā māyeti nigadyate //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>One is pure māyā and the other is avidyā possessing
properties).
<Poem>(43) Tasyāṃ yat pratibiṃbaṃsyād-
bimbabhūtasya ceśituḥ
sa Īśvaraḥ samākhyātaḥ
svāśrayajñānavān paraḥ //
(44) Sarvajñaḥ sarvakartā ca
sarvānugrahakārakaḥ /
avidyāyāṃ tu yat kiṃcit
pratibiṃbaṃ nagādhipa // </Poem>
[Page335-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>(Brahmacaitanya reflected in this māyā is Īśvara
(God). That Īśvara is the same as the ātman (soul),
brahman absolute, creator of everything, omniscient,
and the cause of all blessings. The soul reflects to a
small extent in avidyā also).
<Poem>(45) Tadeva jīvasaṃjñaṃ syāt
sarvaduḥkhāśrayaṃ punaḥ /
dvayorapīha saṃproktaṃ
dehatrayamavidyayā //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>(This jīva is the receptacle of all sorrows. Due to
vidyā and avidyā both get three kinds of bodies).
<Poem>(46) Dehatrayābhimānāccā-
pyabhūnnāmatrayaṃ punaḥ /
prājñastu kāraṇātmā syāt
sūkṣmadehī tu taijasaḥ //
(47) Sthūladehī tu viśvākhya-
strividhaḥ parikīrtitaḥ /
evamīśopi samprokto

(48) Prathamo vyaṣṭirūpaśtu
samaṣṭyātmā paraḥ smṛtaḥ /
sa hi sarveśvaraḥ sākṣāt

(49) Karoti vividhaṃ viśvaṃ
nānābhogāśrayaṃ punaḥ /
macchaktiprerito nityaṃ
mayi rājan prakalpitaḥ. //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>He who is attached and is proud about the material
body is called Viśva; he who attaches importance to
the subtle body is called Taijasa, and he who is aware
of the causal body is called Prājña. The jīva is
Vyaṣṭisvarūpa (has individuality) but Īśvara is
Samaṣṭyātmaka (embraces all the jīvas). Īśvara works
impelled by my power).
