DURVĀRAṆA II¦. A messenger of the very powerful
Jalandhara. When the Devas and the Asuras churned
Kṣīrābdhi (ocean of milk), many excellent things emer-
ged out of it. When those things were divided among
them all, Devendra took possession of 14 gems in an
unauthorised manner. When Jalandhara, through his
messenger Durvāraṇa, demanded Devendra to return
the gems, not only did he not return them but he also
declared war against Jalandhara. When war broke out
Jalandhara hesitated as to whether he should fight
with Viṣṇu or with Śiva. Durvāraṇa advised him first
to fight with Śiva. (Padma Purāṇa, Uttarakhaṇḍa,
Chapter 16).
