Ikṣvāku.
[Page539-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus: Brahmā—
Marīci—Kaśyapa—Vivasvān—Vaivasvata Manu—
Ikṣvāku—Nimi.
<div n="NI"/>Among the sons of Ikṣvāku, Daṇḍa, Vikukṣi and Nimi
became famous.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Vasiṣṭha's curse.%} Emperor Nimi was very generous
with his gifts. He was interested in performing yajñas.
The feeding hall that can be seen even today near the
āśrama of Gautama Maharṣi was built by emperor Nimi.
The emperor, a person of rājasic nature, decided to
conduct a Yajña which would take a long time to end
and which required much money for gifts; and he got
his father Ikṣvāku's permission for it. Arrangements
were made for the Yajña, and Ṛṣis like Bhṛgu, Aṅgiras
Vāmadeva, Pulastya, Pulaha and Ṛcīka who were
competent to perform yajña and great scholars in the
Vedas were invited for the Yajña. Lastly he met his
family preceptor Vasiṣṭha and told him thus: “Oh
preceptor! I have made all arrangements for a Yajña,
which it is my desire should last for five hundred years.
You would also come with me and see that the Yajña
is duly performed.”
<div n="NI"/>Vasiṣṭha listened to Nimi's request with great atten-
tion. But, he had already been invited by Indra to
conduct a Yajña which would last for five hundred
years, and he would be able to oblige Nimi only after
that period of time. So Vasiṣṭha asked the emperor to
postpone his proposed yajña by five hundred years.
Nimi returned disappointed.
<div n="NI"/>Nimi had no patience to wait for five hundred years.
So he started the yajña with Gautama as his preceptor.
After Indra's Yajña for 500 years was over, Vasiṣṭha
came to Nimi's Yajña hall. Nimi, at the time, was in
the inner apartment of his palace. Though his servants
went to him to tell him that his preceptor Vasiṣṭha
had come, they waited outside his chamber as he
was sleeping then. Within a few moments Vasiṣṭha
was ablaze with anger. He raised his hands and cursed
Nimi thus: “Oh! Nimi, you have insulted me, your
preceptor. You disobeyed my injunction and began the
Yajña. Therefore, let your body be parted from the
soul and fall on the ground.”
<div n="NI"/>This curse of Vasiṣṭha alarmed the servants of Nimi so
much that they roused him from sleep and told him all
about the affair. Nimi hurried to Vasiṣṭha and pro-
strated at his feet. But, he did not shed his anger. This
made Nimi also angry. He also raised up his hands and
cursed Vasiṣṭha thus: “Oh muni! you who got angry
without reason are worse than a Caṇḍāla. Therefore
let your body also be parted from the soul and fall to
the ground.”
<div n="NI"/>Vasiṣṭha got alarmed at the above curse. He ran up to
and submitted his grievance to Brahmā, who told him
thus:—“My son, your action was really fool-hardy.
Yet, I shall advise you a way out of your troubles. You
dissolve your-self in the effulgence of Mitra and Varuṇa
and remain there permanently. After sometime you
will be able to be born without being present in the
womb of a woman. Then you will remember every-
thing about your previous birth will acquire sense of
righteousness and knowledge of the Vedas will become
respected by all and will be omniscient.
<div n="NI"/>The soul of Vasiṣṭha parted from his body on account
of the curse of Nimi, saluted Brahmā, went to the
āśrama of Mitrāvaruṇas and got mixed with their
[Page539-b+ 64]
effulgence. Meanwhile Urvaśī one day came to the
āśrama of Mitrāvaruṇas, who had seminal emission at
her sight. The semen fell into a pot. The pot duly
burst open and there emerged from it Agastya and
Vasiṣṭha.
<div n="NI"/>Nimi returned to the Yajña hall and told the munis
about the curse on him of Vasiṣṭha. While the munis
were helplessly looking on, Nimi's body got separated
from the soul and fell down. The munis placed the
dead body in an uncovered coffin, kept it free from
putrefaction with the help of medicines and mantras
and continued with the Yajña. At the close of the
Yajña the Devas appeared and asked Nimi which did
he prefer to have, a human body or body of a Deva.
He preferred to have a Deva body, and accordingly
ascended to Svarga along with the Devas.
<div n="NI"/>As Nimi had no sons to perform his obsequies the
munis began churning the corpse repeating mantras
and there arose from it an ideal person as glowing as
Nimi. As he was created by ‘mathana’ (churning) the
munis named him Mithi. Again, as he was created
from a dead body he came to be known as Janaka also.
Further, as he was born from the body from which the
soul had departed he was called Videha also. The
famous kingdom of Mithilā on the banks of the Gaṅgā
was founded by this Janaka.
<div n="NI"/>Janaka, the father of Sītā, was a King born in this
dynasty. To all the Kings born in this dynasty the
surname ‘Janaka’ came to be applied. This dynasty is
known as Janakavaṃśa and Videhavaṃśa after emperor
Mithi. (Devī Bhāgavata, 6th Skandha).
