ŪRMILĀ¦. Lakṣmaṇa married Ūrmilā, the daughter of
King Janaka and the sister of Sītā. When Lakṣmaṇa
went to the forest with Śrī Rāma and Sītā, Ūrmilā
remained in Ayodhyā. After the forest life, Śrī Rāma
and Lakṣmaṇa returned with Sītā. When Śrī Rāma
was ruling over the country, two sons were born to
Lakṣmaṇa by Ūrmilā. The elder son was named
Takṣaka and the second was given the name Chatra-

ketu. At the instruction of Śrī Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa went
to the Eastern sea and killed the foresters there and
built there a city called Agatī. Takṣaka was made the
King of Agatī. Lakṣmaṇa then went to the western sea
and killed the Barbarians there and built a city called
Candramatī and made Chatraketu the King of that
city. Being punished by Śrī Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa drowned
himself in the river Sarayū. (See under Lakṣmaṇa).
After that Ūrmilā jumped into a pile of fire and reach-
ed the world of Viṣṇu. (Uttara Rāmāyaṇa).
