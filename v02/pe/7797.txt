<div n="NI"/>2) {%The reason for the curse of the eight Vasus.%} Once the
Aṣṭavasus (Vasus eight in number) came to the hermitage
of Vasiṣṭha, with their wives. The wife of Dyau, one
of the Aṣṭavasus, saw the cow ‘Nandinī’ in the hermit-
age. She and the daughter of Uśīnara were intimate
friends. She wanted to get Nandinī, so that she
might give it as a present to the daughter of Uṣīnara.
According to her wish the Aṣṭavasus caught hold of
the cow and took her home. At that time Vasiṣṭha had
been away. When he returned, he knew about the
theft of the cow and cursed the Aṣṭavasus to take birth
in the wombs of women on earth. It was according to
this curse that the Aṣṭavasus took birth in Gaṅgādevī
the wife of Śantanu. See under Bhīṣma. (Devī Bhāgavata,
Skandha 2).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Indra testing Uśīnara.%} Uśīnara was a just and liberal-
minded King. Indra decided to test the King regard-
ing his liberality. He got Agnideva (fire-god) for his
help. Indra took the form of a Kite and Agni that of
a dove. Both flew down to Uśīnara as if the Kite was
chasing the dove. Uśīnara agreed to protect the dove.
The Kite argued with the King that it was not meet
and right on his part to rob him of his lawful food.
The King agreed to give any other kind of flesh to the
Kite. But the Kite would have none of them. Finally
the Kite agreed to accept the flesh of the King instead,
equal to the weight of the dove. The King cut more
and more flesh from his body, but it could not weigh
equal to the dove. At last the King himself got into
the balance. Then the gods had pity on the King and
the Kite and the dove appeared in their real form and
blessed the King and then they returned to heaven.
(M.B. Araṇya Parva, Chapter 131). In Mahābhārata
a story like this occurs about King Śibi also.
