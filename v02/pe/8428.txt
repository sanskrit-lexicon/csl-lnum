VĪRAṆĪ¦ I (VĪRIṆĪ). A daughter of Brahmā. First,
Brahmā created the Saptarṣis (the seven hermits) by
his mind. After this Rudra was born from the anger
of Brahmā, Nārada from the lap of Brahmā, Dakṣa from
the thumb of Brahmā, Sanaka and the others from the
mind of Brahmā, and the daughter Vīraṇī from the left
thumb of Brahmā. Dakṣa married this Vīraṇī. Nārada
took rebirth as the son of this couple.
<div n="NI"/>Dakṣa married Vīraṇī at the behest of Brahmā. At first
this beautiful woman gave birth to five thousand sons.
Nārada misguided them. Dakṣa got angry at this. He
cursed Nārada. Owing to that curse Nārada had to
take birth again as the son of Dakṣa and Vīrani. (Devī
Bhāgavata, Skandha 7).
