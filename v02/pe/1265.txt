BRĀHMAṆA¦. (BRĀHMIN).
<div n="NI"/>(1) {%Origin.%} Brāhmaṇas, Kṣatriyas, Vaiśyas, and Śūdras
are the caturvarṇas or the four castes. The Purāṇas say
that the four castes originated from different parts of
the body of Brahmā. See Manusmṛti, Chapter 1,
Stanza 87

<div n="NI"/>(With a view to sustain the world, Brahmā ordered acti-
vities, for the four castes (Brāhmaṇa Kṣatriya, Vaiśya,
and Śūdra) who were born from his face, arms, thighs
and feet). From this statement it is seen that the Brāh-
maṇas were born from the face, Kṣatriyas from the
arms, Vaiśyas from the thighs and Sūdras from the feet
of Brahmā.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%The activities of a Brāhmaṇa.%} The duties of a Brāhmaṇa
are, performing sacrifice, and encouraging others to
perform sacrifice, learning Vedas and teaching Vedas,
giving gifts and getting remuneration. A Brāhmaṇa has
two births in one life. Till the time of investiture with
the sacred string is one birth and from that period on-
wards is the second birth. So a Brāhmaṇa is called
‘dvija’ or twice-born.
<div n="NI"/>The Brāhmaṇas were allowed to do the works of agri-
culture, keeping cows, trade and commerce and Kusīda
(money-lending). Living on the interest of money
giving out as loan is Kusīda. But they should not trade
on products from cow, jaggery, salt, lac and flesh.
The suffix ‘Śarmā’ should be added to the name of
Brāhmaṇa. A Brāhmaṇa can have four wives.
