DĪRGHATAMAS¦. A great Muni.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Aṅgiras, the son of Brahmā, had two sons,
Utathya and Bṛhaspati. One day when Utathya was
away from home, Bṛhaspati approached his elder
brother's wife, Mamatā, who was pregnant at the time,
and tried to have sexual union with her. But she tried
to dissuade him and said—“The child in my womb,
born from Utathya's semen has already mastered
Vedas and Vedāṃgas. Your semen is also equally
powerful. How can my womb bear the combined force
of the two semens? So please refrain from this attempt
of yours.” But even after hearing these words of his
sister-in-law, Bṛhaspati was not able to control his
passions. At the time of the intercourse, when the
semen of Bṛhaspati entered the womb, the child within
it cried out—“Father ! this passion is improper. Two
persons have no place here. So withdraw your semen.”
Bṛhaspati did not heed the request. The child in the
womb repelled the semen that entered the womb with
his foot and it dropped on the floor. Bṛhaspati who
became angry, cursed the child. As a result, the boy
was born blind. He got the name “Dīrghatamas”
because he was born blind. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chap-
ter 104).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Family Life.%} In brilliance of parts, Dīrghatamas
<F>1. The story of Brhaspati's union with Mamatā is given in Bhāgavata Purāṇa. According to this story the child in her womb was
Bharadvāja. The Mahābhārata states that the child born to Mamatā was Dīrghatamas.</F>
equalled Bṛhaspati. Dīrghatamas, who was born blind,
married Pradveṣi, a Brāhmaṇī. The couple had many
children, chief of whom was Gautama. But after the
birth of the children, Dīrghatmas fell into evil ways
and became an object of hatred and contempt. The
inmates of āśramas dubbed him a sinner. His wife, was
disgusted with him. One day, the enraged Dīrgha-
tamas, in his fury cursed women as a whole and
Pradveṣī could not control her anger. She, with the
help of Gautama and other sons made a raft and
placing Dīrghatamas on it, floated it down the river
Gaṅgā. The King Bali happened to see the raft float-
ing down the river. He sent men to bring the boat to
the bank. The King recognized Dīrghatamas and
asked the Muni to beget brilliant and intelligent
children by his queen. Dīrghatamas agreed and the
King sent the queen Sudeṣṇā to him. The queen who
did not find pleasure in the company of the blind and
decrepit Muni sent a nurse to him. The nurse bore to
him Kakṣīvān and ten other sons all of whom became
great scholars. After some years the King came to know
that the mother of those boys was the nurse. Then he
sent Sudeṣṇā again to the Muni. Dīrghatamas, after
touching her body blessed her and five sons, Aṅga,
[Page244-a+ 65]
Vaṅga, Kaliṅga, Puṇḍra and Śuṅga were born to her.
They founded five Kingdoms which were known by
their names respectively. They are known by their
modern names: Bhāgalpura, Bengāl, Āndhra, Rāja-
sāhi and Tāmravika.
