JAYANTA I¦. Son of Indra.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu in the following
order: Brahmā—Marīci—Kaśyapa—Indra—Jayanta.
Jayanta was the son born to Indra by his wife Śacī-
devī. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter 112, Stanzas 3 and 4).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Jayanta lost one eye.%} During his forest life, Śrī Rāma
[Page354-b+ 65]
lived with Sītā and Lakṣmaṇa on the mountain Citra-
kūṭa for some days. Once Śrī Rāma, being very tired
of walking in the forest fell asleep with his head in the
lap of Sītā. Taking this chance Jayanta came in the
shape of a crow and scratched the breast of Sītā with
his claws. Sītā cried and Śrī Rāma woke up and saw
Jayanta in the shape of a crow. Rāma got angry and
shot the Brahmāstra (a divine arrow) against Jayanta.
Fear of life made him fly throughout the whole of the
three worlds. Even Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśvara
were unable to protect him, All the while the divine
arrow followed him. Finally having no go he came and
fell at the feet of Śrī Rāma. Śrī Rāma said that the
Brahmāstra could never become futile and so the arrow
must hit his right eye. Accordingly the arrow struck at
his right eye and thus Jayanta lost his right eye. In
Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa this story is stated with some
slight changes. According to Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa,
this incident took place when Sītā had been drying raw
flesh. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Sundara Kāṇḍa, Sarga 38).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Jayanta hidden in the ocean.%} After getting the boons
Rāvaṇa became arrogant and with a big army went to
the realm of the gods. Rāvaṇa engaged Indra in a
fierce battle. In that fight Meghanāda the son of
Rāvaṇa attacked Jayanta, who swooned and fell down.
Immediately Pulomā, the father of Śacīdevī, gathered
Jayanta in his hands unseen by anybody and hid him
in the sea. After the disappearance of Jayanta the battle
entered the second stage. Thinking that his son Jayanta
had been killed, Indra began to fight with Rāvaṇa
with more vigour than before. In the battle which
followed Meghanāda subdued Indra and made him a
captive. Taking Indra and the celestial maids as
captives, Rāvaṇa and his men went to Laṅkā. (Uttara
Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Jayanta became Bamboo.%} Once Agastya came to
Indra's durbar. Indra arranged for the dance of
Urvaśī in honour of Agastya's visit. In the midst of
the dance Urvaśī saw Jayanta before her and she fell
in love with him. Consequently her steps went out of
beat. Nārada who was playing his lute called Mahatī
went wrong. Agastya got angry and cursed Jayanta
and changed him to a bamboo. Urvaśī was cursed to
become a woman with the name Mādhavī. Agastya
cursed Nārada that his lute Mahatī would become the
lute of the people of the world. (Vāyu Purāṇa).
