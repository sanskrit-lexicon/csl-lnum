PRAMĀṆAKOṬI¦. A sacred place on the banks of the
river Gaṅgā. There is a great banyan tree named
Pramāṇakoṭi at this place. It was at this spot of the
river that Duryodhana poisoned Bhīmasena and threw
him into the river, bound hand and foot. The Pāṇḍa-
vas who went for their exile in the forests spent their
first night at this spot. (Śloka 41, Chapter 1, Vana
Parva).
