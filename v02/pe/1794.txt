[Page207-a+ 63]
the system by which the wealth of parents is received by
the heirs. The system of inheritance as described by Manu
is as follows:—
<div n="NI"/>1) After the death of the parents, all the children should
divide their wealth among themselves. When either the
father or the mother is alive, the sons should not take
their wealth.
<div n="NI"/>2) If the wealth is not divided, the eldest brother should
keep the whole of it in his custody and maintain his
brothers and sisters like a father.
<div n="NI"/>3) Of the entire wealth, the eldest brother may take one-
twentieth part, the second brother, one-fortieth part
and the third brother, one-eghtieth part and the balance
is to be divided equally among all of them.
<div n="NI"/>4) If there are more than three sons, the eldest and the
youngest may take one-twentieth and one-eightieth (of
the entire wealth) respectively, and each of the other
brothers may take one-fortieth. The rest of the pro-
perty must be divided equally among all of them.
<div n="NI"/>5) After dividing like this, if there are unmarried sisters,
each of the brothers should give one-fourth of his share
for their marriage.
<div n="NI"/>6) The ornaments which the mother had received by
way of her dowry etc. may be taken after her death by
her unmarried daughters.
<div n="NI"/>7) If, after his marriage, one of the brothers dies, the
brother who keeps his movable and immovable proper-
ties, must beget children by the brother's wife and hand
over the above properties to her issue. (See under
Manusmṛti).
