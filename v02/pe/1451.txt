CANDRAŚARMĀ II¦. A brahmin of Agni gotra from
Māyāpura, he was the disciple and son-in-law of Deva-
śarman. Both of them were killed by a Rākṣasa while
they were gathering darbha (a particular variety of
grass used in religious ceremonies) in the forest. Candra-
śarmā attained Vaikuṇṭha as he was a very righteous
person. During Kṛṣṇāvatāra (incarnation of Viṣṇu
as Śrī Kṛṣṇa) he was born as Acrūra. (Padma Purāṇa).
