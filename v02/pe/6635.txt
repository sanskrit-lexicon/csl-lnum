ŚIŚUMĀRA II¦. A constellation so called because it is in
the form of a Śiśumāra (Crocodile). It is said to be
the starry form of Viṣṇu. At the tail-end of it is
Dhruva, which automatically rotates and also makes
planets like the Sun and the moon to rotate. Stars
follow the self-rotating Dhruva and rotate like a wheel.
The Sun and the moon along with stars and planets
are bound by the cord of atmosphere to Dhruva.
<div n="NI"/>The basis and support of this constellation of Śiśumāra
is Mahāviṣṇu, who is the support of all light and
effulgence. Dhruva, son of Uttānapāda came to be
installed at the tail-end of Śiśumāra as he had wor-
shipped Viṣṇu. Śiśumāra is dependent upon Viṣṇu, the
Lord of all, and Dhruva is dependent upon Śiśumāra.
Sūrya is dependent on Dhruva. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Part 2,
Chapter 9).
