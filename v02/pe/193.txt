AMBARĪṢA I¦. A King of the Ikṣvāku dynasty.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy and Birth.%} From Viṣṇu was born in the
following order: Brahmā-Marīci-Kaśyapa.-Vivasvān-
Vaivasvatamanu-Ikṣvāku-Vikukṣi-Śaśāda-Purañjaya-
Kukutstha-Anenas-Pṛthulāśva-Prasenajit-Yuvanāśva-
Māndhātā-Ambarīṣa. Māndhātā had three sons: Amba-
rīṣa, Mucukunda and Purukutsa and fifty daughters.
[Page029-b+ 64]
The Muni (Sage) Saubhari married the daughters.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Ambarīṣa's Yāga (sacrifice).%} In Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa
there is a story of Devendra's theft of the sacrificial
cow from Ambarīṣa's yāgaśālā. Devendra could not
bear the thought of King Ambarīṣa winning world-
renown and glory by performing yāgas. Therefore Indra
stole the sacrificial cow and took it away. The Upā-
dhyāya (Chief Priest) was alarmed at the disappear-
ance of the cow and expressed his opinion to the King
that it would be enough to sacrifice a human being in-
stead of the cow. The King searched for the cow in all
countries, cities and forests. At last he reached the
peak of Bhṛgutuṅga where the sage Ṛcīka lived with
his wife and children. The King explained to the sage
the whole story. He requested him to sell one of his sons
in exchange for 100,000 cows. Ṛcīka had three sons.
The eldest was his father's favourite and the youngest
was the mother's pet. In the end, Ṛcīka sold the second
son, Śunaśśepha in return for 100,000 cows.
<div n="NI"/>On his return journey with Śunaśśepha the king rested
for a while at Puṣkara Tīrtha. There Śunaśśepha
happened to meet his uncle Viśvāmitra and complain-
ed to him about his sad plight. Śunaśśepha's wish was
that the king's yāga should be performed and at the same
time his own life-span should be extended. Viśvāmitra
promised to save Śunaśśepha. He called Madhu-
cchandas and his other sons and said to them: “One of
you must take the place of Ambarīṣa's sacrificial cow
and save the life of Śunaśśepha. God will bless you.”
<div n="NI"/>But none of the sons of Viśvāmitra was prepared to
become the sacrificial cow. Viśvāmitra uttered a curse
on his sons that they would have to spend a thousand
years on earth, eating dog-flesh. Then he turned to
Śunaśśepha and told him that if he prayed to the gods
at the time of Ambarīṣa's yajña, they would save him.
<div n="NI"/>So Śunaśśepha went to Ambarīṣa's yāgaśālā. As
ordered by the assembled guests, Ambarīṣa bound
Śunaśśepha and had him dressed in blood-red robes,
ready for the sacrifice. Śunaśśepha began to praise and
pray to the gods. Soon Indra appeared and blessed him
with longevity. He also rewarded Ambarīṣa for his
yāga. Thus Śunaśśepha was saved.
<F>*) The story of Śunaśśepha may be seen with slight variations in the Devī Bhāgavata and other Purāṇas. In those versions, Śunaśśepha
has been described as the sacrificial cow at Hariścandra's yāga, and moreover, Ajīgarta is referred to as the father of Śunaśśepha. (Brahmāṇḍa
Purāṇa, Chapter 58 gives the same story as in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).</F> (Vālmīki Rāmā-
yaṇa Bāla Kāṇḍa, Sarga 61).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Ambarīṣa and Durvāsas.%} In Bhāgavata we see a story
which describes how the Sudarśana Cakra which emerg-
ed from Ambarīṣa's forehead chased Durvāsas in all
the three worlds. Ambarīṣa was a devout worshipper of
Viṣṇu. From the very beginning of his reign, peace and
prosperity spread all over the country. Mahāviṣṇu
who was pleased with the deep piety and devotion of
Ambarīṣa appeared to him and bestowed on him the
control of his (Viṣṇu's) Sudarśana Cakra. After that
Ambarīṣa started the observance of Ekādaśī vrata.
The rigour of the observance alarmed even Indra. He
decided to obstruct the observance somehow or other. At
that time, Durvāsas arrived in devaloka. Indra insti-
gated Durvāsas to spoil the Ekādaśī observance of
Ambarīṣa.
<div n="NI"/>Durvāsas went to Ambarīṣa's palace. There the King
received him with due respect and sent him to the river
Kālindī for his bath and morning rites. Durvāsas went
[Page030-a+ 65]
for his bath and deliberately stayed away till the con-
clusion of Ambarīṣa's Ekādaśī observance. At the end
of the observance, after feeding the gods with his
offerings, Ambarīṣa kept the remaining portion for
Durvāsas. After his bath etc., Durvāsas returned, but
he was furious when he was offered the leavings of the
food of the gods and refused to take any food. In his
anger he advanced towards Ambarīṣa. A terrible mons-
ter Kṛtyā emanated from the Maharṣi and was about
to destroy Ambarīṣa. Ambarīṣa at once called upon
Sudarśana Cakra, which appeared instantly and after
cutting the throat of Kṛtyā, turned against Durvāsas.
Terrified by it, Durvāsas began to flee for life. The
Cakra pursued him at his heels. Durvāsas went to Indra
and sought refuge with him. But the Cakra followed
him there. Indra pleaded helplessness. Then the
Maharṣi went to Brahmā and sued for his help. There
also the Cakra pursued him. Brahmā sent him to Śiva.
Śiva was also unable to give him shelter. Sudarśana con-
tinued to chase him. Durvāsas then sought shelter with
Mahāviṣṇu. Viṣṇu told him plainly that there was
no alternative but to go and sue for mercy to Amba-
rīṣa himself and advised him to do so. At last Durvāsas
returned to Ambarīṣa and begged his pardon. Ambarīṣa
saved him from Sudarśana Cakra and described to him
the glory resulting from the observance of Ekādaśī
vrata. (Bhāgavata, Navama Skandha).
