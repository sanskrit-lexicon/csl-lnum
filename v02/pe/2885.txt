JARĀ¦. A harpy (Rākṣasī). Though she was a harpy
she loved human beings. It is believed that if the
picture of Jarā and her children is placed in the
house and venerated, there will be no haunting of any
other kinds of demons.
<div n="NI"/>The figure of Jarā was sculptured on the wall of the
Palace of Bṛhadratha, the King of Magadha, and was
being worshipped. Because the King worshipped her,
she had been looking forward to an opportunity to
reward the King. Bṛhadratha had married two
daughters of the King of Kāśī. They were twin sisters.
For a long time they remained childless. The King
was very sorry, and went to the forest with his wives.
He saw the hermit Kakṣīvān or Caṇḍakauśika, the son
of Gautama and requested that a son should be born
to him. The hermit was sitting in meditation under a
mango tree and a mango fell on his lap. The hermit
took it and by prayer and meditation he invoked
divine power into it and gave it to the King. The King
divided it into two and gave it to his wives. The queens
became pregnant and the three returned joyously.
<div n="NI"/>In due course both delivered. But each of them gave
birth to only half of a child. The horrified queens took
the uncouth figures outside the palace and left them
there. Jarā was watching this. She ran to the spot
and placed the two portions together. Instantly it
became a child of proper form. Hearing the cry of the
child the mothers came out. Jarā appeared there and
placed the child before the King Bṛhadratha. As desired
by Jarā the child was named Jarāsandha because he
was joined together by Jarā. This child grew up and
became the notorious King Jarāsandha of Magadha.
(M.B. Sabhā Parva, 3 Chapters from 17).
<div n="NI"/>It is mentioned in Mahābhārata, Droṇa Parva, Chapter
182, Stanza 12 that when Arjuna fought with Jarā-
sandha this harpy had been staying in the weapon of
Jarāsandha and was killed in that fight.
