VIDŪRATHA III¦. A king who was the friend of the her-
mit Bhalanda. This king had two sons named Sunīti and
Sumati and a daughter named Mudāvatī. One day while
Vidūratha was hunting in the forest, he saw a cleavage
on the earth caused by the yawning of Kujṛmbhāsura.
The king stood there for a while looking at the cleavage.
Then the hermit Suvrata who had been standing close
by approached the king and said. “This asura Kujṛmbha
has a divine pestle with him. Because of the possession
of this pestle he has become invincible and is a threat
to the whole world.”
<div n="NI"/>Vidūratha, who knew everything from Suvrata, lived
cautiously. One day his daughter was carried away by
this Kujṛmbhāsura. Sunīti and Sumati confronted the
asura to rescue their sister but were made captives.
Finally Vatsapri, the son of the hermit Bhalanda killed
the Rākṣasa (giant) and liberated princess Mudāvatī.
