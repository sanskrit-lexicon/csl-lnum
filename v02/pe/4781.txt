NAUBANDHANA¦. A peak of the Himālayas. The peak
came to be known by this name on account of the
following cause. Once upon a time Hiraṇyakaśipu stole
the Vedas and with them hid in the bottom of the
ocean. Mahāviṣṇu incarnated himself as fish to restore
the Vedas. The world then was submerged in water
and the maharṣis escaped in a boat attached to the
horns of the Makara fish. On earth flood rose upto the
peaks of the Himālayas. The Saptarṣis attached their
boat to a peak of the mountain and that came to be
known as Naubandhana. (nau = boat; bandha = tie).
(Vana Parva, Chapter 187, Verse 50).
