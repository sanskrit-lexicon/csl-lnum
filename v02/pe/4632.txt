MURĀRI¦. A Sanskrit dramatist who lived in the 8th
century A.D. in India. His father was Bhaṭṭaśrīvarddha-
māna. Murāri is the author of the drama ‘Anargha-
rāghava’. This drama has eight acts. Murāri has men-
tioned in his works about Anaṅgaharṣa who lived in
700 A.D. and Ratnākara who lived in 750 A.D. It is
therefore, surmised that Murāri must have lived during
the latter part of the 8th century. In the writing of
dramas Murāri has excelled the Mahāvīracarita of
Bhavabhūti and his verses indicate he had the style of
Māgha.
