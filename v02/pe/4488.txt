MEDHĀTITHI I¦. Grandson of Svāyambhuva Manu.
Svāyambhuva Manu had two sons named Priyavrata and
Uttānapāda. Of these Priyavrata married Sarūpā and
Barhiṣmatī, daughters of Viśvakarmaprajāpati. Medhā-
tithi was the son born to Priyavrata of Sarūpā. Agnī-
dhra, and others were the brothers of Medhātithi.
Medhātithi became the King of Plakṣadvīpa after the
death of Priyavrata. (8th Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
Medhātithi got seven sons named Śāntahaya, Śiśira,
Sukhodaya, Ānanda, Śiva. Kṣemaka and Dhruva. They
all became Kings of Plakṣadvīpa. The countries they
ruled were named after them as Śāntahayavarṣa, Śiśira-
varṣa, Sukhodayavarṣa, Ānandavarṣa, Śivavarṣa, Kṣema-
kavarṣa and Dhruvavarṣa. There are seven mountains
showing the boundaries of these states and they are
called Gomeda, Cāndra, Nārada, Dundubhi, Somaka,
Sumana and Vaibhrāja. In these beautiful countries
and grand mountains live a great many Devas,
Gandharvas and virtuous men. (Chapter 4, Aṃśa 2,
Viṣṇu Purāṇa).
