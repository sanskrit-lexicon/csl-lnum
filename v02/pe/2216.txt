DUṢYANTA I¦. A reputed King of the Lunar dynasty.
2) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Viṣṇu thus:—Brahmā—
Atri—Candra—Budha—Purūravas—Āyus—Nahuṣa—
Yayāti—Pūru—Janamejaya—Pracinvān—Namasyu—
Vītabhaya—Śuṇḍu—Bahugava—Saṃyāti—Rahovādī
Raudrāśva—Matināra—Santurodha—Duṣyanta.
<div n="NI"/>Matināra had two sons: Santurodha and Pratiratha,
and Santurodha had three sons: Duṣyanta
<F>1. The genealogy given above has been taken jointly from Agnipurāṇa, Bhāgavata and Viṣṇupurāṇa. But the Mahābhārata
(Ādi Parva, Chapter 94, Verse 17) gives Ilin as the name of Duṣyanta's father and Rathantī as that of his mother. It may be
surmised that Santurodha and Ilin were one and the same individual.</F> Pravīra
and Sumanta. Pratiratha begot Kaṇva and he, Medhā-
tithi.
<div n="NI"/>{%His reign.%} Within a short period of time Duṣyanta
became the emperor of India. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 68,
Verse 3). His empire extended up to the sea, and he
became an object of envy for other rulers. Under his rule
the four castes flourished in affluence. None was threa-
tened with illness or by thieves. The seasons marched
in due order, the clouds raining at the proper time etc.
“Like the ocean not getting agitated, and putting up
with everything with unique patience like the earth,
Duṣyanta ruled the country” (Ādi Parva, Chapter 68).

<div n="NI"/>3) {%Marriage and birth of son.%} Once Duṣyanta set out
to a forest to hunt. Seated in his chariot, which moved
with the speed of Garuḍa he came to a beautiful forest.
Weary with hunger and thirst the King, leaving the
attendants behind walked into the hermitage of the sage
Kaṇva. Proceeding along the sand on the banks of
Mālinī river and drinking with his eyes the beauties
of the hermitage he reached Kaṇva's āśrama. ‘Who
is there in the āśrama?’ queried the King, whereupon
Śakuntalā, the foster daughter of Kaṇva came out, and
in the absence of her father welcomed the guest.
Enchanted by the beauty of Śakuntalā, the King
questioned her about her lineage and she told him the
story about Viśvāmitra's love for Menakā, and Kaṇva
bringing up their daughter. Duṣyanta felt deep love
for her, and in accordance with rules prescribed in
Dharma śāstras married her in the Gāndharva way. He
also accepted her stipulation that the son born to her
should become the next monarch. Śakuntalā got preg-
nant, and after promising that she would duly be
conducted to the palace Duṣyanta returned.
<div n="NI"/>No sooner had Duṣyanta left the āśrama than Kaṇva,
who had been out returned to the āśrama. With his
divine eyes he understood what had happened in his
absence. Kaṇva blessed Śakuntalā that she would have
an excellent son, who would become an excellent
ruler of the world surrounded by the sea.
<div n="NI"/>In due course of time Śakuntalā delivered a son. Kaṇva
did the rites pertaining to the birth of the child, and
named the child Sarvadamana. The child grew up to
become six years old, and Kaṇva realising that the
further stay of Śakuntalā and her son at the āśrama
would stand in the way of the child's welfare and pro-
gress sent the mother and the child to Hastināpura,
the capital of Duṣyanta, attended by his disciples.
When they reached Duṣyanta's palace and sent word to
him about their arrival he, pleading ignorance about
his marriage with Śakuntalā, refused to receive her and
the child. Duṣyanta and Śakuntalā hotly argued the
question. At last, when Śakuntalā, with swelling
emotions was about to leave the palace, a celestial voice
announced that Duṣyanta had, in fact, married
Śakuntalā, that Sarvadamana was his son and that he
(Sarvadamana) would become a great ruler under the
name Bharata. (Ādi Parva, Chapters 69-74).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other information.%} (1) Duṣyanta did not eat flesh.
(Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 115, Verse 64).
<div n="NI"/>(2) After his death Duṣyanta stayed in Yama's assembly
worshipping him. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 8, Verse 15).
