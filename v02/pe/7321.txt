SUTAPAS VII¦. A hermit. This hermit once approached
the princess Utpalāvatī and requested her for coition
with him. The princess refused. Then he cursed her,
to become an animal. Utpalāvatī begged for liberation
from the curse. Sutapas felt pity for her and blessed
her thus:—“A son named Lola will be born to you.
He will become the Manu of Tāmasa Manvantara.”
(Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa, Chapter 17).
