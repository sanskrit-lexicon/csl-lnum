ĀNANDAVARDHANA¦. A great critic of Sanskrit litera-
ture. He lived in the 9th century A.D. He expounded
his theory of Dhvanivāda by 120 Kārikās. His own
commentary of the Kārikās is the book called Dhvanyā-
loka. There are four parts for Dhvanyāloka and each
part is called an Udyota.
<div n="NI"/>There is a belief among a few that the Kārikās were
written by another scholar, Sahṛdaya, and that Ānanda-
vardhana had written only a commentary on it. He
was a member of the royal council of Avantivarmā
who ruled Kashmīr during the period 854-884 A.D.
It is believed that he wrote Dhvanyāloka in 850 A.D.
Many commentaries have been written of Dhvanyāloka
of which the one written by Abhinavagupta is consider-
ed to be the best.
