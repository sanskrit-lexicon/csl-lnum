DUŚŚĀSANA II¦. Another Duśśāsana, servant of the
son of King Khaḍgabāhu of Saurāṣṭra is also mentioned
in the Purāṇas.
<div n="NI"/>Khaḍgabāhu had a famous elephant, which one night
broke its chains and escaped, and all the mahouts
could not chain it again. People in terror of the elephant
ran helter-skelter. Now, a brahmin was going that way
chanting verses of the 16th Chapter of the Gītā, and even
though the mahouts warned him he did not change
his path. Instead he saluted the elephant by touching
its cheeks and proceeded on his way unhurt by the ani-
mal. The King felt great respect for the brahmin when
he was told that he owed his miraculous powers to
the 16th chapter of the Gītā, and he took the brahmin
with him to his palace. The King gave him 100,000 golden
coins and received from him the Gītā mantra. He began
reciting daily certain verses in the 16th Chapter of the
Bhagavadgītā.
<div n="NI"/>Some time afterwards the King one day went to an
open ground near his palace accompanied by soldi-
ers and set the elephant free from its chain. Then,
unheeding the entreaties of the frightened people he
approached the elephant, saluted it by touching its
cheeks and came away unhurt. He could act in this
fashion because of his firm faith in the efficacy of the
Bhagavadgītā. And afterwards he placed his son, on the
throne and himself led a life of recluse repeating the
Bhagavadgītā.
<div n="NI"/>Some Purāṇas have another version of this episode.
Duśśāsana was a servant of Khaḍgabāhu's son and he
attempted to catch the elephant but was killed
by it. He attained salvation by hearing the 17th Chap-
ter of the Bhagavadgītā.
<div n="NI"/>Duśśāsana, an idiot, betting a huge sum of money with
the junior mahouts of the elephant and unheeding the
warnings of several people once mounted the elephant.
Children agitated the animal and Duśśāsana fell down
from its back. The angry animal stamped the fool to
[Page264-b+ 64]
death, and its rage having not yet subsided it threw
around his bones. Duśśāsana, who ended his life thus
was reborn as an elephant and was owned by King
Jayadeva of Ceylon for a long time. A great friend of
King Khaḍgabāhu, Jayadeva presented the elephant
to him. At the sight of its brothers and other relations
memory about its previous birth dawned on the eleph-
ant. And, it lived in great grief. After some days the
King presented the animal to a poet pleased at his
samasyāpūraṇa (filling the three lines of a stanza in
tune with the fourth line given). The poet sold the
elephant to the King of Mālava as it got ill with
fever. In spite of the best treatment administered to it
the elephant seemed to be nearing its end. Without
either eating or drinking or sleeping the animal stood
motionless shedding tears day and night. One
day, the Mālava King visited the elephant when,
to the surprise of all assembled there, the elephant
spoke to the King thus: “Oh, King: if a brahmin
recites the 17th Chapter of the Bhagavadgītā I will
be completely cured of my illness.”
<div n="NI"/>Accordingly a brahmin was brought. As soon as he
chanted the Gītā and sprinkled water on its head it
got rid of its animalhood, ascended the divine aero-
plane and shone forth like Indra. The Mālava King
also began daily reciting the Bhagavadgītā and within a
short time afterwards attained salvation. (Padma
Purāṇa, Chapter 8).
