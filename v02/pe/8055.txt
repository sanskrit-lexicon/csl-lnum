VARUṆA I¦. One of the eight guardians of the quarters.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Varuṇa was the son of Prajāpati, Kaśyapa
born of Aditi. He was one of the twelve sons of Aditi.
So he is considered to be one of the twelve Ādityas (Sons
of Aditi). The twelve Ādityas are Dhātā, Aryaman,
Mitra, Śakra, Varuṇa, Aṃśa, Bhaga, Vivaśvān, Pūṣā,
Savitā, Tvaṣṭā and Viṣṇu. (M.B. Ādi Parva, Chapter
65, Stanza 15).
<div n="NI"/>These twelve Ādityas were the twelve Devas (gods)
known as Tuṣitas in the Manvantara of Manu Cākṣuṣa.
A statement occurs in Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 1, Chapter
15, that when Vaivasvata Manvantara was about to
begin after the end of Cākṣuṣa Manvantara, the famous
Tuṣitas united together and took birth as the sons of
Kaśyapa.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Kingship of the waters.%} In Kṛtayuga the Devas
approached Varuṇa and said to him. “You must be
the lord of all the waters, as Indra is our protector. You
can live in the heart of the ocean. All the rivers in the
world, and the ocean which is their husband will obey
you. You will wax and wane along with Candra
(Moon).” Varuṇa agreed to comply with their request.
[Page832-b+ 64]
All of them anointed Varuṇa as the King of the
waters. (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 47).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%The Guardian of the quarter west.%} Brahmā appointed
Varuṇa as the guardian of the western zone. Vaiśravaṇa
once did penance before Brahmā, and when Brahmā
appeared before him, he made a request that he should
be appointed as one of the guardians of the quarters.
Brahmā replied. “I have already selected Indra, Varuṇa
and Yama as guardians of the points. I was thinking
who, the fourth, should be, when you came. So from
this day onwards, Indra shall be the guardian of the
East, Yama that of the South, Varuṇa, that of the
West and you Vaiśravaṇa shall be the guardian of the
North.” After saying this, Brahmā disappeared. Thus
Varuṇa became the guardian of the West. (Uttara
Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Family.%} Varuṇa had several wives and children.
Prominent among them were Gaurī and Varuṇānī.
Mention is made about the sons Suṣeṇa, Vandī and
Vasiṣṭha and daughter Vāruṇī. Cārṣaṇī was another
wife of Varuṇa. Prajāpati Bhṛgu, who died in the
sacrifice of Dakṣa took birth as the son of Varuṇa and
Cārṣaṇī. Devī Jyeṣṭhā, the daughter of Priest Śukra was
another wife of Varuṇa. The children of Jyeṣṭhā were
Bala, Surā the Suranandinī and Adharmaka the destroy-
er of the elements. The semen of Varuṇa fell on
Valmīka (White-ant-hill) from which the great hermit
Vālmīki was born. Besides them, Dakṣasāvarṇi, the
ninth Manu was the son of Varuṇa. Puṣkara was an-
other son of Varuṇa. The handsome Puṣkara was
received as husband by the daughter of Soma (Can-
dra). Vandī, who was defeated by the hermit Aṣṭā-
vakra at the palace of Janaka was the son of Varuṇa.

<div n="NI"/>5) {%Carrying away Utathya's wife.%} Bhadrā, the daughter
of Soma (Moon) was extremely beautiful. Some gave
her in marriage to the hermit Utathya. Varuṇa carried
her away. Utathya got angry and drank up the ocean
dry. Varuṇa returned Bhadrā to Utathya. (For
further details see under Utathya).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Theft of Varuṇa's cow by Kaśyapa.%} Kaśyapa once
decided to perform a sacrifice. He made all prepara-
tions. But he did not get the required cow at the sti-
pulated time. So he got the Homadhenu of Varuṇa
by theft and began to perform the yāga (sacrifice).
Varuṇa knew this. Instantly he went to Kaśyapa and
demanded his cow. But Kaśyapa refused to return the
cow. Varuṇa complained to Brahmā, who sent for
Kaśyapa and asked him about the cow and both
Brahmā and Varuṇa cursed Kaśyapa that he who had
taken the cow by stealth would take birth as a cowherd
in Ambāḍi. (For further details see under Kaśyapa
