DEVAHŪTĪ¦. A daughter of Svāyambhuva Manu, the
son of Brahmā. The Manu had two sons called Priya-
vrata and Uttānapāda and three daughters named
Ākūti, Devahūti and Prasūti. Ākūti was married by
Ruciprajāpati and Devahūti by Kardamaprajāpati
and Prasūti to Dakṣprajāpati. Kapila, the mighty
exponent of the Sāṅkhya system of philosophy and great
ascetic was the son born to Kardama by Devahūti.
Kapila taught his mother the world famous Kapila
Śāstra, (Devibhāgavata, Aṣṭama Skandha) and when the
teaching was over he bade farewell to her and took to
forest life. And, his mother performed a yajña on the
lines advised by her son, on the banks of river Sarasvatī.
Because she took three baths daily her hairs became a
mixture of black and blue in colour and she got emacia-
ted due to fasting. She wore the bark of trees. Deva-
hūti, who realised all the principles and the truth be-
came blind to all external objects like gardens, maids,
mansions etc. Thus immersed in meditation she in
course of time attained siddhi (realisation). The parti-
cular spot on the banks of Sarasvatī where she attained
Siddhi is called Siddhapada.
