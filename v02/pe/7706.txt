UJJAYINĪ¦. One of the seven very sacred places in ancient
India. Its ancient name was Avantī. The seven sacred
cities are: Ayodhyā, Mathurā, Māyā, Kāśī, Kāñcī,
Avantikā, and Dvāravatī. The famous Mahākāla temple
described by Kālidāsa was on the banks of the river
Śiprā flowing through Ujjayinī. Jyotirliṅga of Śiva is
the presiding deity in the temple. There is also a holy
bathing ghat called Koṭitīrtha here. A bath in it is as
beneficial as an Aśvamedha yajña. (M.B. Vana Parva,
Chapter 82).
