DAMANA IV¦. A son of Bharadvāja. After the investiture
with the Brahma string (upanayana) Damana started
on a travel. On the way near Amarakaṇṭaka he met
with the hermit Garga who talked to him about the
glory of Kāśi. Damana who was a seeker of spiritual
knowledge, stopped his travel and sat down to do penance
and thus leaving his body he attained heaven. (Skanda
