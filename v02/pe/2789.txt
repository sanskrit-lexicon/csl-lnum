IRĀVĀN¦. A son born to Arjuna of the serpent damsel
(Nāgakanyā) named Ulūpī. (For genealogy see under
Arjuna).
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} According to the practice laid down Pāñcālī
used to live with each husband for one year by turn.
When she was living with one husband the other four
husbands had no admission there. When once Arjuna
wanted his arms to redeem the cows of a brahmin
stolen by thieves he entered the apartment of Dharma-
putra where the arms had been kept and took them.
For thus having entered, against rules, the apartment
then kept by Dharmaputra and Pāñcālī, Arjuna had to
[Page332-a+ 65]
go on a pilgrimage for one year. Numerous brahmins
accompanied Arjuna and while spending the night on
the banks of the Gaṅgā, Arjuna entered its waters for
bathing. There he saw the Nāga damsel, Ulūpī. They
fell in love with each other and got married. And, a
son named Irāvān was born to them. Ulūpī granted
Arjuna the boon that all water-animals would obey
him and that in water he would be invincible. Leaving
Ulūpī and Irāvān behind, Arjuna continued his stay in
the forest.
