PAÑCAMAHĀYAJÑA¦. For a Gṛhasthāśramī (house-
holder) the following five apparatuses are unavoidable:
A sifter, a grinding stone, a broom, a wooden mortar
and a water-pot. It is believed that a sin is committed
when each of these is used and to remove the sins thus
committed the ancient sages have prescribed five
yajñas and these five yajñas are called the Pañcamahā-
yajñas. They are the Brahmayajña, Pitṛyajña,
Devayajña, Bhūtayajña and the Mānuṣayajña.
Reciting of Vedas is Brahmayajña. Pleasing the
manes by offering rice or libations of water is called
Pitṛyajña. Giving offerings to the demi-gods in the
sacrificial fire is called Devayajña and religious
offerings of rice to the crows is called Bhūtayajña.
Giving food for the guests is Mānuṣayajña. One who
does not do the Pañcamahāyajñas is no better than dead.
Some scholars have classified the Pañcamahāyajñas
as Huta, Prahuta, Brāhmyahuta, Prāśita and Ahuta.
<Poem>Japo huto huto homaḥ
Prahuto bhautiko baliḥ //
Brāhmyaṃ hutaṃ dvijāgnyarccā
Prāsitam pitṛtarpaṇam. //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>Ahuta is Brahmayajña, huta is devayajña, prahuta is
bhūtayajña, brāhmyahuta is mānuṣikayajña and
prāśita is pitṛyajña. Even if at times one finds it not
possible to do mānuṣikayajña one must perform daily
brahmayajña and daivayajña. The offerings given to
gods in the sacrificial fire go to the Sun. The Sun
sends rains to the earth which in turn make the plants
flourish. Vedas say that thus living beings increase. Just
as all animals and objects depend on life-breath for
living, a Brahmacārī, a Vānaprastha and a Sannyāsī
depend upon a gṛhastha for sustenance. Therefore, the
Gṛhasthāśrama is the best of all āśramas. (Chapter 3,
Manūsmṛti).
