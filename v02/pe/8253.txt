VIDHAVĀ¦ A woman whose husband is dead. In
ancient India, it was ordained how a widow should
live. It was allowed for a widow to get a son by her
younger brother-in law to continue the family line in
case the death of her husband occurred before the
couple had children. The procedure about this is
given in Manusmṛti, Chapter 9.
<div n="NI"/>“He who goes to accept the widow with the permission
of great people, should besmear his body with ghee and
go to her bed in the night in a dark room. She should
have only one son in this manner. After she has become
pregnant, they should behave to each other as a
teacher and a younger brother-in-law.”
