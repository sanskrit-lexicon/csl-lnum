DUḤKHA¦(M). Agni Purāṇa tells the following about
the origin of Duḥkham.
<div n="NI"/>Hiṃsā (violence) is the wife of Adharma (unrighteous-
ness). To the couple were born two daughters called
Anṛta (falsehood) and Nikṛta (fraud) and from them
were born the daughters Bhayā (fear) Naraka (hell)
Māyā (illusion) and Vedanā (pain). Māyā brought
forth Mṛtyu (death), the annihilator of all living
objects, and Vedanā, from Raurava (a particular hell)
brought forth Duḥkha (sorrow, grief). From Mṛtyu
were born Jāti (caste), Jarā (wrinkles), Śoka (sorrow),
Tṛṣṇā (covetouseness) and Krodha (anger). (Agni Pu-
rāṇa, Chapter 19).
