PAÑCAKARṆAVĀTSYĀYANA¦. A Vedic preceptor.
Because Pañcakarṇa was born in the family of Vātsya
he got the name Vātsyāyana.
<div n="NI"/>In the language of Yogic treatises the seven life-winds
in the human head are called the ‘Saptasūryas’ (seven
suns). Pañcakarṇavātsyāyana had a clear knowledge
of these Saptasūryas and has given a vivid description of
them. (Taittirīya Āraṇyaka).
