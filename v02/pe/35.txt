ADITI¦. 1) {%Genealogy.%} Kaśyapa, grandson of Brahmā and
son of Marīci married Aditi, daughter of Dakṣaprajā-
pati. Aditi had twelve sisters: Diti, Kālā, Danāyus,
Danu, Siṃhikā, Krodhā, Pṛthā, Viśvā, Vinatā, Kapilā,
Muni and Kadrū. (Mahābhārata, Ādi Parva, Chapter
65, Verse 12). Devas are sons born to Kaśyapa by Aditi
and hence they are known as Āditeyas also. Kaśyapa
married all the thirteen sisters including Aditi, and
[Page003-b+ 65]
all living beings owe their origin to them. (See Kaś-
yapa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Descendants.%} 33 sons were born to Aditi. 12 of them
are called Dvādaśādityas, viz. Dhātā, Aryamā, Mitra,
Śakra, Varuṇa, Aṃśa, Bhaga, Vivasvān, Pūṣā, Savitā,
Tvaṣṭā and Viṣṇu. Amongst the other 21 sons are the
11 Rudras and 8 Vasus. (See M.B. Ādi Parva,
Chapter 65, Verse 15).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Main incidents.%} 1. {%How Mahāviṣṇu was born as the%}
{%son of Aditi.%} The Mahābhārata and the Rāmāyaṇa
refer to a story about the birth of Mahāviṣṇu as the
son of Aditi. Viṣṇu entered the womb of Aditi as
Vāmana (Dwarf). This story was related by the sage
Viśvāmitra to the boys Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa while
they were accompanying the sage in the forest. When
they entered Siddhāśrama Viśvāmitra pointed to the
latter that the Āśrama was sacred, because Mahāviṣṇu
had stayed there for long as Vāmana. The Devas
induced Mahāviṣṇu to obstruct the sacrifice (yāga)
being performed by Emperor Mahābali, son of
Virocana. At that time Aditi, the wife of Kaśyapa
was doing penance so that Mahāviṣṇu might be born
as her son, and accordingly he entered her womb.
1000 years later she gave birth to Viṣṇu, and that child
was known as Vāmana. (See Vāmana; also M.B.
Vana Parva, Chapter 272, Verse 62, Anuśāsana Parva,
Chapter 83, Verses 25 and 26, as also Vālmīki Rāmā-
yaṇa, Canto 29).
<div n="NI"/>2. {%Rebirth of Aditi.%} Once Kaśyapa made all arrange-
ments to perform a sacrifice (yāga). Having failed to
get the suitable cow for it, he stole Varuṇa's cow and
conducted the yāga. Not only that, Kaśyapa refused
to return the cow even after the yāga was over.
Varuṇa in hot anger rushed to Kaśyapa's hermitage.
Kaśyapa was absent, and his wives, Aditi and Surasā
did not treat Varuṇa with due respect. The enraged
Varuṇa cursed them to be born in Gokula. He also
complained about the matter to Brahmā. Brahmā told
Kaśyapa: “Since you, a learned person, have stolen
the cow, may you along with your wives be born in
Gokula and tend cows”. Accordingly Kaśyapa and
his wives, Aditi and Surasā, were born respectively as
Vasudeva, Devakī and Rohiṇī in Gokula in the 28th
Dvāpara yuga. (This story has been told by Vyāsa
to Rājā Janamejaya). (Devībhāgavata, Skandha 4).
<div n="NI"/>3. {%Aditi in prison.%} Devakī is Aditi reborn. There was
reason for Devakī being imprisoned on the orders of
Kaṃsa. When Kaśyapa was living in an Āśrama with
Aditi and Diti he was so much pleased with the
services of Aditi that he asked her to beg for any
boon she wished. Accordingly she prayed for an
ideal son. The boon was readily granted, and Indra
was the son thus born to her. The birth of Indra
engendered jealousy in Diti towards Aditi, and she
also demanded a son equal to Indra. Kaśyapa obliged
Diti also. As Diti advanced in pregnancy and her
beauty also increased Aditi got jealous of the former
and she called her son Indra and told him that unless
something was done in time, Diti would deliver a
child equal to him (Indra) thus relegating him pro-
bably to the place of second Deva. Thus admonished
by his mother the artful Indra approached Diti and
told her: “Mother, I have come to serve you”. Diti
was greatly pleased. Indra's services drove Diti to
sleep very quickly, and Indra used the opportunity
[Page004-a+ 65]
to enter the womb of Diti and cut into 49 pieces the
child with his weapon, the Vajra. The child in the
womb began crying on receiving cuts with Vajra when
Indra asked it not to cry. (Mā ruda, don't cry) and
so the child got out of Diti's womb as 49 Mārutas
(winds). Then did Diti wake up and cursed Aditi as
follows: “Your son did treacherously kill my
offspring in the womb itself. So he will forfeit the
three worlds. You were responsible for the murder of
my child. You will, therefore, have to spend days in
prison grieving over your children. Your children also
will be annihilated”. Because of this curse of Diti,
Indra once lost Devaloka and had to live elsewhere,
and Nahuṣa functioned, for a time as Indra. (See
Nahuṣa). In the 28th Dvāpara yuga Aditi trans-
formed as Devakī had to be a captive of Kaṃsa, and
Kaṃsa killed her children by dashing them on the
ground. (Devībhāgavata, Skandha 4).
<div n="NI"/>4. {%Narakāsura stole the earrings of Aditi.%} Narakāsura, who
turned out to be a curse and menace to the three worlds
consequent on the boon he got from Viṣṇu, attacked
Devaloka once, and carried off Indra's royal umbrella
and Aditi's earrings. Mahāviṣṇu incarnated himself as
Śrī Kṛṣṇa, killed Narakāsura in battle and got back the
earrings etc. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 48, Verse
80; Sabhā Parva, Chapter 38, Verse 29; Bhāgavata
Daśama Skandha).
<div n="NI"/>5. {%Mahāviṣṇu became seven times son to Aditi.%} Once, de-
sirous of having children Aditi cooked food (rice)
sitting herself in the entrails of Mount Mynaka (M.B.
Āraṇya Parva, Chapter 135, Verse 3). Dharmaputra,
in the course of singing the glories of Lord Kṛṣṇa after
the great war refers to Viṣṇu having taken birth
seven times in the womb of Aditi. (M.B. Śānti Parva,
Chapter 43, Verse 6).
<div n="NI"/>6. {%Budha cursed Aditi.%} A story in the Mahābhārata
refers to Budha's once cursing Aditi. The ever increas-
ing power of Asuras made the Devas anxious. Aditi,
the mother of the Devas decided to send them all to
annihilate the Asuras. She had finished cooking food
for her sons, and lo! there appeared before her Budha
and asked for food. Aditi asked him to wait pending
her sons taking their food hoping that there would be
some food left after that. This caused Budha to lose
his temper and he cursed her that (Aditi) she would
become the mother of Vivasvān in his second birth
as Aṇḍa, when she would suffer pain in her abdomen.
(M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 34, Verses 96-98).
<div n="NI"/>7. {%Former birth of Aditi.%} During the former years
(period) of Svāyambhuva Manu the Prajāpati called
Sutapas, along with his wife Pṛśni did Tapas for
12000 years. Then Mahāviṣṇu appeared before them,
and Pṛśni prayed for a son like Viṣṇu himself, and
Mahāviṣṇu was born as her son named Pṛśnigarbha.
This story is related by Śrī Kṛsna to his mother on
his birth as the son of Vasudeva. (Bhāgavata, Daśama
Skandha, Chapter 3).
<div n="NI"/>She, who became the wife of Prajāpati as Pṛśni before
Svāyambhuva Manu, and was born again as Devakī,
the wife of Vasudeva is one and the same person.
