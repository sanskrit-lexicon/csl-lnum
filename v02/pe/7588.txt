TRIPURA¦. A phantom city built by Maya.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin.%} Kaśyapa Maharṣi son of Marīci and grand-
son of Brahmā had many wives. Of them Aditi got the
first place and Diti the second place. Both of them were
daughters of Dakṣa Devas were born of Aditi and the
asuras were born of Diti. Armies of asuras under the
leadership of Śūrapadma, Siṃhavaktra, Tārakāsura,
Gomukha, Hiraṇyākṣa, and Hiraṇyakaśipu gave immense
trouble to the devas. The devas joined together under
the leadership of Indra and fought the asuras. The
nectar received from the ocean of Milk always made
the devas the conquerors. When Subrahmaṇya slew
Tārakāsura the asuras became very weak.
[Page793-b+ 65]
At this stage Kamalākṣa, Tārakākṣa and Vidyunmālī,
sons of Tārakāsura, did severe penance and made Brahmā
appear before them. They demanded a boon that they
would never be killed by anybody in any of the three
worlds. Brahmā told them to ask any boon other than
that. Then they said: “Great Lord, we must live in
three cities and then roam about freely in the three
worlds by your grace. Every thousand years all the
three of us should join together at a place with our
cities. After that meeting, we should separate and roam
about freely for another thousand years. If at all there
is death for us, it should occur only when we three
are together and that also by one arrow.” Brahmā
granted the boon and disappeared.
<div n="NI"/>The asuras then approached Maya and asked him to
construct three separate cities for them. Maya built
three wonderful cities. One was with gold, another
with silver and the third with iron. Tārakākṣa took
the golden one, Kamalākṣa took the silver one and
Vidyunmālī took the iron one. The asuras started
living in these cities. The three puras were respectively
in Svarga, Ākāśa and the Earth. But each city had the
power to travel to any other place at will. The power
of controlling these cities was given to Bāṇa. Hiraṇya-
kaśipu's son was Prahlāda. Prahlāda's son was Viro-
cana. Mahābali was Virocana's son and Bāṇa was
Mahābali's son (Chapter 14, Padma Purāṇa). All these
three cities together were named Tripura.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Mṛtasañjīvanī Vāpī.%} (The life giving tank). Even
with the existence of Tripura the asuras began to die in
numbers and the Tripuras thought of a way to escape
from this calamity. Hari, son of Tārakāsura, did penance
and made Brahmā appear before him in person.
According to a request from Hari Brahmā made Maya
build a tank wonderful in nature. Brahmā filled the
tank with nectar. If any asura died, it was enough if he
was dipped in the tank and the dead asura would soon
come to life with added strength and vigour. Asuras
became immortal since this and the Tripuras started
teasing the devas and men with increased ferocity.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Consultation with Śiva.%} The aggrieved devas approach-
ed Brahmā and finding him incapable of helping took
him to Śiva. Śiva heard everything and assured them
that he would kill them when they next met together at
the end of a thousand years.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Śiva makes preparations.%} As a first step to the slaughter
of the Tripuras, Śiva sent Nārada to Tripura. Nārada
by his unusual spiritual powers made the asura women
feel more and more attached to the devas. Śiva at that
time thinking about the convenience for a fight with
the Tripuras came and settled down on the shores of
the river Narmadā. That was how Narmadā became
a holy river. (Chapter 13, Padma Purāṇa).
<div n="NI"/>Śiva had to make grand preparations for a fight with
the Tripuras. He invoked half the strength of the devas
to himself to make Śivaśakti (Javelin of Śiva) greater
than Asuraśakti. The devas made Viśvakarmā construct
a special chariot for Śiva. On the banks of the river
Narmadā at a place which became renowned as
Maheśvara Śiva stayed for a thousand years thinking
about the fight with the Tripuras. He made the mount-
ain of Mandara his bow, Vāsuki, the string and
Viṣṇu his arrow. He installed Agni at the tip and Vāyu
at the bottom of the arrow. Four devas stood as horses
to his chariot. The earth itself was the chariot and all
[Page794-a+ 65]
the animate and inanimate objects of the devaloka
arrayed at different parts of the chariot. On the wheels
stood the Aśvinīdevas and Cakrapāṇi stayed on the
axle. Gandharvas took places on the spokes. Indra
stayed on the bow and Vaiśravaṇa on the arrow. Yama
took his place on the right hand and the dreadful Kāla
on the left hand. Brahmā acted as the charioteer.
<div n="NI"/>Equipped thus, Śiva stayed in the godly chariot for a
thousand years. When the three cities joined together
in the sky Śiva split the cities by his three forked spike.
Then he sent an arrow to the cities. Bad omens began
to appear in Tripura. People became lifeless in the
cities. Soon an arrow from Śiva burnt the cities and
the Tripuras were burnt to death. (7th Skandha,
Bhāgavata; Chapters 31 to 34, Padma Purāṇa; Chapters
33 and 34, Karṇa Parva).
