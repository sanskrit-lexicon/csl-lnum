DHANVANTARI II¦. (Amṛtācārya). An eminent medi-
cal scientist born in the ambaṣṭha caste. There is no
reference anywhere in the Purāṇas regarding any
relationship between the two Dhanvantaris. There is
the following story about Amṛtācārya in Ambaṣṭhācāra-
candrikā.
<div n="NI"/>Once Gālava Maharṣi went to the forest to collect
darbha and firewood. He walked for long and felt
thirsty and hungry. Then he saw a girl coming that
way with water and Gālava quenched his thirst taking
water from her. Pleased with her the Maharṣi blessed
her saying “May you get a good son.” The girl replied
that she was still unmarried. Gālava then made a figure
of a male with darbha and told her to get a child from
that figure. She was a Vaiśya girl named Vīrabhadrā
and she got a beautiful child of that darbha male.
Because the boy was born to a Vaiśya of a brahmin
male he belonged to the Ambaṣṭha caste. The boy was
named Amṛtācārya.
