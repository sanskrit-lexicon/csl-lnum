CAITRARATHA¦(M). A forest of purāṇic fame. Once
King Yayāti enjoyed sexual acts with the apsaras
Viśvācī in this forest. (Śloka 43, Chapter 75, Ādi
Parva). It was here in this forest that Pāṇḍu spent some
days once with his wives Mādrī and Kuntī. (Śloka 48,
Chapter 118, Ādi Parva).
<div n="NI"/>As a support to the great mountain Mahāmeru were
four mountains, Mandara, Merumandara, Supārśva
and Kumuda. Above each of these was a garden-wood,
Nandana, Caitraratha, Vaibhrājaka and Sarvatobhadra.
Thus it is to be presumed that Caitraratha was on
Merumandara. (Chapter 16, Pañcama Skandha,
Bhāgavata).
