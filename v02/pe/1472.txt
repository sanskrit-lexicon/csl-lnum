CĀṆŪRA II¦. An asura, one of the attendants of Kaṃsa.
Kaṃsa had employed as his body-guards many
pugilists—Pralaṃbaka, Cāṇūra, Tṛṇāvarta, Muṣṭika,
Ariṣṭaka, Keśi, Dhenuka, Agha and Vivida and these
pugilists were sent with Pūtanā to Gokula to kill Śrī
Kṛṣṇa. On the death of Pūtanā they returned to
Mathurā. When Kaṃsa invited Kṛṣṇa to Mathurā
Cāṇūra and Muṣṭika were the chief pugilists entrusted
with the duty of killing Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa fought with
Cāṇūra and Balabhadra with Muṣṭika. Both Cāṇūra
and Muṣṭika were killed. (Bhāgavata Daśama Skandha).
