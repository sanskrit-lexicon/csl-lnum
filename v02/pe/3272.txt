KAPILA I¦. A fierce sage.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy and birth.%} Kapila was the son of Kardama-
prajāpati, son of Brahmā, born to him of his wife
Devahūti, grand-daughter of Brahmā and daughter of
Svāyambhuva Manu.
<div n="NI"/>Svāyambhuva Manu got two sons named Priyavrata and
Uttānapāda and three daughters named Ākūti, Deva-
hūti and Prasūti. The daughters were married to Ruci,
Kardama and Dakṣa respectively. To Ruci was born of
Ākūti a boy named Yajña. He was a partial incarnation
of Viṣṇu. To Kardama was born of his wife Devahūti
Kapilācārya, a great sage and the celebrated exponent
of the Sāṅkhya philosophy. Prasūti got many daughters
(8th Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>Sage Kapila was known as Cakradhanus also. (Śloka 17
Chapter 109, Udyoga Parva).
<div n="NI"/>Kardama married the daughter of Vaivasvata Manu
called Devahūti. They spent their honeymoon in the
air travelling throughout the world. Devahūti delivered
nine daughters and a son named Kapila. Kardamapra-
jāpati gave his daughters in marriage to Marīci and the
other sages.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Kapila—incarnation of Viṣṇu.%} The Brahmāṇḍa
Purāṇa states that Kapila was the incarnation of Viṣṇu.
In Chapter 93 there is this statement: “Bhagavān
Nārāyaṇa will protect us all. The Lord of the universe
has now been born in the world as Kapilācārya.”
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Kapila imparts spiritual knowledge to his mother.%} Kapila
started a severe penance. At that time Kardamapra-
jāpati died and Devahūti wife of Kardama and mother
of Kapila approached Kapila and asked him to instruct
her on the path of Bhakti Yoga. Kapila imparted to her
spiritual knowledge and gave her instructions to follow
the path of Bhakti Yoga for Salvation. She entered into
a life of austerities and attained Samādhi. (3rd Skandha,
Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%How Kapila burnt to ashes the Sagarputras.%} Once there
was a king called Sagara in the Solar dynasty. He had
two wives named Keśinī and Sumati. Keśinī got a son
named Asamañjasa and Sumati got sixtythousand sons.
Once Sagara conducted an Aśvamedha Yāga at a place
where the rivers Sindhu and Gaṅgā meet. Aṃśumān,
son of Asamañjasa led the sacrificial horse. Indra dis-
guised as a demon stole the horse when it came to a
mountain side and hid it in the nether worlds.
<div n="NI"/>Sagara sent his sixtythousand sons in search of the horse.
They dug the whole continent of Jambūdvīpa surround-
ed by mountains. Devas, gandharvas and bhujaṅgas
complained to Brahmā. Then Brahmā said: “The whole
of this world belongs to Viṣṇu. He has incarnated him-
self as sage Kapila to kill the sons of Sagara and is
now in the nether-world bearing this world. In the fire
of his anger the Sagaraputras will be burnt to death”.
On hearing this all of them came back.
[Page388-b+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>The Sagaraputras returned to their father when they
could not find the horse. But Sagara ordered “Go and
dig again till you find it”. They went to the nether
world. After circling the eight elephants who carry the
world they dropped down to the nether world through
the north-east corner of the earth. There they saw sage
Kapila engaged in penance and the sacrificial horse
grazing by his side. The sons of Sagara made a great
hubbub there and Kapila produced a big sound of
rebuke and stared at them. All the sixtythousand sons
of Sagara were reduced to ashes. For more details see
under Bhagīratha. (Sargas 39 and 40, Bālakāṇḍa.
Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Kapilayogaśāstra.%} Kapila made the renowned Kapila-
śāstra sitting in his Āśrama and taught it to his mother
Devahūti. Kapila was a great yogin. The yoga Śāstra
itself is based on the Sāṅkhya philosophy of Kapila. His
Sāṅkhya Śāstra, known as Kāpila Śāstra also, contains
the distinctive yoga of meditation and it creates in you
spiritual knowledge removing your ignorance totally.
After teaching his mother his ‘Kāpila’ he went to the
Āśrama of Pulaha and lived there. (8th Skandha, Devī
Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Other details regarding Kapila.%}
<div n="NI"/>(i) Kapila was the preceptor of the King of Sindhu.
5th Skandha, Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Kapila visited Bhīṣma while the latter was lying
on his bed of arrows before his death. (Śloka 8, Śānti
Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) There occurred a discussion once between Kapila
and a Sage named ‘Gau’ on the subject whether Gṛhas-
thadharma (doing one's duty as a house-holder) or
yogadharma (doing yoga practices) was superior.
(Chapter 286, Śānti Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) Kapila was a sage of great brilliance of body.
When the sons of Sagara went to the nether world in
search of the horse they saw the sage Kapila sitting
there radiating a brightness equal to that of fire. (Chap-
ter 107, Araṇya Parva).
