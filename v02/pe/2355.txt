GĀRGYA I¦. (TRIJAṬA) GĀRGA. A famous sage.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} He was one of the sons of Viśvāmitra. (Śloka
55, Chapter 4, Anuśāsana Parva). (For genealogy see
under Viśvāmitra). He became gradually the priest of
Gudavas. He has written a famous book called Garga-
smṛti. Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa mentions that Gārgya is
known as Trijaṭa also.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%How he became prosperous.%} Sage Gārgya had many
children. It was while he was staying in the forest with
his wife and children that Śrī Rāma came to that forest
for Vanavāsa. The news of the exile of Śrī Rāma spread
like wild-fire and many brahmins flocked to the place
and Śrī Rāma gave them immense riches. Wife of Gār-
gya heard the news only late and as soon as she heard
the same she called her husband from the fields where
he was working and taking away from him the imple-
ments sent him post-haste to the place of Śrī Rāma.
Trijaṭa as soon as he came to the presence of Rāma told
him the purpose of his visit. Huge herds of cows were
then grazing on the banks of the Yamunā river. Śrī
Rāma told Gārgya to take a stump and throw it with
all his strength. He did so and Śrī Rāma gave him all
the cows grazing up to the place where the stump fell.
It was a big lot and Gārgya became prosperous from
that day onwards. (Sarga 32, Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki
Rāṃāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Gārgya's precepts on Dharma.%} The following are the
precepts laid down by Gārgya on Dharma. (1) Be
interested always on entertaining your guests, (2) Do not
eat meat, (3) Do not give injury to cows and brahmins,
(4) Perform yajña with a pure mind and pure body.
(M. B. Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 127).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Gārgya's place in the line of preceptors.%} Vyāsa expound-
ed the Vedas to Vedamitra, Saubhari and Śākalya.

galya, Śāli, Ādiśiśira, Gokhali and Yātukarṇa, Yātu-
karṇa taught Nirukta to Bāṣkala, Krauñca, Vaitāla, and

gether and made ‘Bālakhilyaśākhā’ and taught it to
Bālāyini, Gārgya and Saṃsāra. The Ṛgvedācāryas
are those from Vyāsa to Saṃsāra. (Bhāgavata, Daśama
Skandha).
