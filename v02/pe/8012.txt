VARĀHA III¦. (Boar). One of the ten incarnations of
Mahāviṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Need for this incarnation.%} Jaya and Vijaya, two door-
keepers of Mahāviṣṇu showed disrespect towards
the famous hermits Sanaka and others who went to
visit Mahāviṣṇu. The angry hermits cursed them to take
birth as asuras. Accordingly Jaya and Vijaya took birth
as the two asuras Hiraṇyākṣa and Hiraṇyakaśipu and
were born from Prajāpati Kaśyapa by his wife Diti.
<div n="NI"/>Even their birth itself was inauspicious. Once, while
Kaśyapa was carrying on evening worship, his wife was
filled with libido. She embraced Kaśyapa. Because she
got pregnancy in an inauspicious moment, two asura
sons were born. At the time of their birth darkness
spread over the whole of the world, and some ill omens
were seen. The Devas (gods) trembled.
<div n="NI"/>The elder son was called Hiraṇyākṣa and the second
son was called Hiraṇyakaśipu. As Hiraṇyākṣa grew up
he began to quarrel with the Devas. When the fight
grew fierce, he picked up the earth in his hands as a
ball and went under water. There was left only water.
The Devas went to Mahāviṣṇu and prayed to him in
order to get the earth back.
<div n="NI"/>At this time Manu Svāyambhuva, the son of Brahmā,
was living with his father looking after his welfare. The
father, who was pleased with the services of his son
said. “My dear son, you should worship Devī, who will
be pleased with your devotion and will bless you. If
she is pleased with you, you will become a famous
Prajāpati.” Hearing the words of Brahmā, Svāyam-
bhuva worshipped Devī with ardent devotion, deep
meditation and severe vows and penance, at which
Jagadambā was pleased. She appeared before him and
asked him what boon he wanted. Manu requested that
he should be permitted to carry on creation without
any obstruction. Devī gave him permission. Manu
[Page827-a+ 65]
returned to his father Brahmā and said. “Father, point
out to me a solitary place. I will sit there and create
subjects by the blessings of Devī.” Only when he heard
the request of his son, did Brahmā begin to think about
the exigency of providing his son with such a place. For,
the earth was completely under water. For a long time
even Brahmā was being subjected to much incon-
venience to carry on creation. Only Bhagavān Ādi
Nārāyaṇa (Viṣṇu) could do anything in this matter. So
Brahmā with the Manus, hermits and others began to
meditate on Mahāviṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Incarnation.%} Instantly the young one of a Boar
jumped out of the nose of Brahmā through his breath.
That divine figure of Boar stood in the air and began to
grow. Within a few moments, it became a colossal
Being. It grew up as big as an elephant. Soon it be-
came as large as a mountain. Seeing this, Brahmā and
the others stood in amazement. The Boar made a grunt
in a loud roaring sound. The people of Janaloka, Satya-
loka etc. understood that it was the sound of Mahā-
viṣṇu. They raised glory and praise to Bhagavān, who
heard all these praises, but without condescending to
tell anything, looked at all of them with grace and love,
and with a mighty force jumped into the sea. It was
immensely troubled by the manes of God Almighty.
Varuṇa prayed to him to save him from them. Bhagvān
folded his mane and went down to the deep water and
made a search for the earth. The Boar walked smelling
and snorting and found out the earth. He slowly lifted
it on his tusks and started from there. On the way, the
fierce and wicked Hiraṇyākṣa hindered him. Bhagavān
Viṣṇu used his club Nandaka and killed Hiraṇyākṣa. It
was besmeared with his blood; Mahāviṣṇu came up to
the surface of water with the earth. He set the earth
firm over the water. Thus Brahmā gave Manu a place
in the earth which floated on the water like a lotus-leaf,
and empowered him to perform creation.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Incarnation of Boar again.%} The goddess Earth, the
deity of earth which was raised to the surface of water,
fell in love with Mahāviṣṇu and embraced him. He
embraced her in return. These mutual embraces conti-
nued for one complete Devavarṣa (year of God) and
consequently the goddess Earth became tired and weak
and unconscious. So the earth slid down a little under
water. Bhagavān took the form of a Boar again and
lifted the earth to its original place and returned to
Vaikuṇṭha. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 3; Devī Bhāgavata
Skandhas 8 and 9; Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 5; Padma
Purāṇa, Bhūmikhaṇḍa, Chapter 91).
