YOGA II¦. It is Jñāna that reveals Brahman. Yoga is the
concentration on Brahman. Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 372,
mentions that Yoga is the perfect union of Jivātmā and
Paramātmā.
<div n="NI"/>In fact Yoga is activity with the body as its basis. It
may be doubted how a mere physical karman helps
Parabrahmadārśana. But Maharṣis assert that there
is an inseparable connection between matter and soul.
<div n="NI"/>Matter and soul are merely the two phases of the
single “Astitva”. The object of Yoga is to achieve
union with Parabrahman; in other words, to attain
Mokṣa. The recitation of mantras is important in many
disciplines connected with the practice of Yoga. The
letters and words of mantras are so arranged that their
recitation in the proper manner produces profound and
favourable effects in the body. The habitual recitation
of mantras helps the practice of Yoga.
<div n="NI"/>There are two broad divisions of Yoga—Haṭha Yoga
and Rāja Yoga. The two are interconnected and have
to be practised simultaneously. Haṭha Yoga is mainly
concerned with disciplining the body by various kinds
of exercises. Standing in Pañcāgni with the arms held
aloft; standing on one leg or standing on the head are
some of these exercises. Rāja Yoga aims at arousing
Prajñā by control of the senses.
[Page898-b+ 64]
Rāja Yoga involves the practice of eight disciplines.
They are:—Yama, Niyama, Āsana, Prāṇāyāma,
Pratyāhāra, Dhāraṇā, Dhyāna and Samādhi. An
account of each of these is given below:—
<div n="NI"/>i) {%Yama.%} Yama means refraining from evil courses or
sinful things like cruelty or dishonesty. Yama demands
the practice of Ahiṃsā, satya, asteya, brahmacarya and
aparigraha. (Ahiṃsā = non-violence or not killing any
creature. Satya = truth; practising truth in thoughts,
words and deeds. Asteya = not stealing. Brahmacarya =
sexual continence. Aparigraha = not coveting wealth or
pleasures which are not absolutely necessary).
<div n="NI"/>ii) {%Niyama.%} While Yama is a negative discipline,
Niyama is a positive one. It requires the positive practice
of virtuous courses. Niyama includes five things:—
Śauca (cleanliness), Santoṣa (contentment), Tapas
(penance and austerities), Svādhyāya (study of the
Vedas and incantations or mantras) and Īśvarapraṇi-
dhāna (prayer and meditating on God). Śauca means
not only cleanliness of the body, but also of the mind.
The mind must be purged of all ‘malas’ like kāma,
krodha and lobha. Tapas means ability to endure
opposites (dvandvas) like heat and cold or joy and
sorrow. Svādhyāya is “study of philosophical works.”
Īśvarapraṇidhāna—dedicating all actions unto God.
<div n="NI"/>iii) {%Āsana.%} The way of sitting or posture. Different
postures have been prescribed for different actions.
First of all, the yogī must choose a suitable place.
<div n="NI"/>(The place must be level, neat, free from stones, fire or
gravel, agreeable to the mind and not causing irritation
to the eyes). (Śvetāśvatara).
<div n="NI"/>Different āsanas like Padmāsana, Svastikāsana and
Siddhāsana have been prescribed for the practice of
Yoga.
<div n="NI"/>Putting the left leg on the right thigh and the right leg
on the left thigh, holding the right toe with the left
hand and the left toe with the right hand, place the
chin on the chest and look at the tip of the nose. This
is Padmāsana.
<div n="NI"/>Sitting upright with the feet tucked under the hips is
Svastikāsana.
<div n="NI"/>Placing the left leg under the genitals, put the right
leg on it. Insert the chin into the pit of the throat;
control the senses; with steady eyes look at the point
between the eye-brows. This is Siddhāsana which will
break open the doors to Mokṣa.
<div n="NI"/>iv) {%Prāṇāyāma.%} This is regulation of breathing. Inhale
air through the left nostril, retain the air in the lungs
for a few minutes and then exhale it through the right
nostril. The process may be reversed—that is inhala-
tion through the right nostril and exhalation through
the left. This is the first step in Prāṇāyāma. Exhaling
the breath and then not inhaling for some time is
called recaka; the opposite process is called pūraka.
The object of prāṇāyāma is to awaken Kuṇḍalinī.
<div n="NI"/>v) {%Pratyāhāra.%} This is a process of withdrawing the
five senses from the outer world. A man who practises
Pratyāhāra becomes oblivious of the outer world. This
helps the concentration of the mind on the Ātman.
<div n="NI"/>vi) {%Dhāraṇā.%} Withdrawing the mind from outer objects
and concentrating it on the self.
<div n="NI"/>vii) {%Dhyāna.%} Meditation, concentrating the mind on
several places like Bhrūmadhya and nābhīcakra. Re-
peating the sacred syllable OM is very useful in dhyāna.
[Page899-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>viii) {%Samādhi.%} In Samādhi the soul and mind unite,
the mind merging into the soul. Samādhi is defined
thus:—
<div n="NI"/>When the mind and soul unite just as salt and water
unite, that state is called Samādhi.
