[Page803-b+ 65]
also. Once this hermit happened to forget that he had
left flowers, food and his waterpot on the bank of the
river and reaching his hermitage, he asked his son
Nāciketa to fetch them from the bank of the river.
When Nāciketa reached the bank of the river, those
things had been washed down by the current. The son
returned and reported the matter to his father. The
father got angry and cursed his son to death. Seeing
the son lying dead on darbha (mattress made of darbha
grass) the hermit cried aloud. In that flow of tears life
returned to the body and the son woke up as if from
sleep. The father asked the son about the news of the
realm of Yama (the god of death) and the son told the
hermit the news about the world of the dead.
