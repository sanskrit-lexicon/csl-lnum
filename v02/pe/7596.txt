TRIŚIRAS¦ II (VIŚVARŪPA). Once there was a celebrat-
ed Prajāpati of name Tvaṣṭā. Though he was of a pious
nature interested in the welfare of Brahmins, he hated
Indra. He thought of destroying Indra somehow. With
that purpose in view he produced by his wife Recanā,
a powerful son and named him Viśvarūpa. The boy had
three heads and so he was called Triśiras (Tri=Three
Śiras—head) also. He could use his three heads for
three different purposes at a time. He would drink wine
with one head and mutter the Veda-mantras by another
head and see the world by the third.
<div n="NI"/>Even from boyhood he disliked worldly pleasures and,
abandoning even food, started to do penance. During
the hot season he would sit amidst fire and during the
cold season he would sit in water to do penance. He
would stand with his head down and do penance. The
penance of Triśiras was so severe that Indra began to
get frightened. He sent celestial maidens to stop the
penance but all the attempts proved futile before that
great ascetic. Then Indra himself riding on Airāvata
went and killed the sage by his Vajrāyudha. Indra
feared whether Triśiras would come to life again and
wreak vengeance on him. So he ordered a carpenter
standing nearby to bring to him the three heads separat-
ed from the body. The carpenter cut off the heads from
the body and as each head fell to the ground several
kinds of birds were found escaping from it. From the
head which used to mutter Vedic mantras rose the
Kapiñjala birds; from the head used for drinking wine
rose Kalapiṅga birds and from the third rose the Tittiri
birds. When the birds thus rose to the air Indra was
convinced that Triśiras was dead and he went away
See under Viśvarūpa. (6th Skandha, Devī Bhāgavata).
