AITAREYA II¦. Son of Sage, Māṇḍuki by his first wife,
Itarā. Being the son of Itarā he came to be called Aita-
reya. As a boy he was very pious and used to chant the
mantra “Namo Bhagavate Vāsudevāya” frequently. But
he was a shy and silent boy and his father mistook his
silence to be a sign of stupidity. Dissatisfied with him and
being desirous of having learned sons, Māṇḍuki married
another woman named Piṅgā and had four sons by her
who all became very learned. Once Itarā called her
son and told him that his father regarded him as an
unworthy son and was often twitting her using insulting
words for having given birth to so unworthy a son. She
then told him of her resolve to sacrifice her life. Aita-
reya then made an enlightening discourse to her and
dissuaded her from her determination to commit suicide.
Some time later Lord Viṣṇu appeared before them and
blessed the mother and son. On the advice of Viṣṇu
Aitareya participated in the yajña conducted by Hari-

medhya at Koṭitīrtha and there he made a learned
speech on the Vedas. Harimedhya was so pleased with
him that he gave his daughter in marriage to him.
