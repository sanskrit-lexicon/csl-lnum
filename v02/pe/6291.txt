SĀRASVATA II¦. An ancient hermit. It is mentioned
in Mahābhārata, Śalya Parva, Chapter 51, Verse 7,
that Sārasvata was the son of Dadhīca. Dadhīca once
happened to see the celestial maid Alambuṣā and
became excited, and seminal discharge occurred to him.
The semen fell in the river Sarasvatī. The river became
pregnant and delivered a child. This child grew up
and became the famous hermit named Sārasvata.
<div n="NI"/>After the death of the hermit Dadhīci, due to scarcity
of rain a great famine occurred which lasted for twelve
years. When the famine became unbearable all the
hermits on the basin and banks of the river Sarasvatī
began to migrate to other places leaving all their
possessions behind, to save their lives. But Sārasvata
alone remained on the banks of Sarasvatī, living on
fish obtained from the river, engaged in meditation
and study of Vedas.
<div n="NI"/>After twelve years the famine ended and the country
became prosperous as before. The hermits who had gone
to other places began to come back to their hermitages.
The desire to study Vedas grew up in their minds.
But there was not a single person, well-versed in the
Vedas, except Sārasvata. So all the hermits accepted
him as their teacher. Thus Sārasvata taught the Vedas
to Sixtythousand hermits, who had returned to their
hermitages. (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 50).
<div n="NI"/>In course of time the place where the hermitage of
Sārasvata stood, became famous under the name
Sārasvata tīrtha. Tuṅgakāraṇya is another name of
this place. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 83, Verses
43-50).
<div n="NI"/>In ancient days there were two schemes of study known
as ‘Kāṇḍānukramapāṭha’ and ‘Sārasvatapāṭha’ for the
Taittirīya-collection (Saṃhitā). But today the
Kāṇḍānukramapāṭha has become quite extinct. The
following is a description, given in Śaṃskāraratnamālā
stating how the ‘Sārasvatapāṭha’ attained so vigorous a
vogue.
<div n="NI"/>Once owing to the curse of the hermit Durvāsas, the
river Sarasvatī took birth as a woman in the house of
a Brahmin, who belonged to the Gotra of Ātreya.
Later from that same Brahmin she conceived and gave
birth to a son named Sārasvata. The river Sarasvatī
herself, taught her son the Vedas completely, and then
[Page695-a+ 64]
sent him to Kurukṣetra to do penance. As a result
of the penance Sārasvata got an original Kramapāṭha
(serial lessons) of the Taittirīya saṃhitā. He taught
those serial lessons to his disciples. In course of time
these serial lessons got the name Sārasvatapāṭha.
which earned metaphysical and philosophical import-
ance.
