KUMBHAKA II¦. (Nikumbhaka). A very reputed sage.
If he visited any place at dusk he left it only after a
thousand years. He visited Kāśī once when King Divo-
dāsa was ruling the state after having killed the Rākṣasa
called Kṣemaka, who had lived like a king there. Kum-
bhaka lived in a forest in Kāśī with his disciples.
Prosperity reigned supreme within a radius of three
Yojanas from where the sage lived. Neither wild beasts
nor famine infested the area.
<div n="NI"/>Once a fierce famine broke out in Kāśī, and the failure
of rain caused great havoc. Finding it impossible to

feed the cows their keepers went with their live-stock
every morning to Kumbhaka's place where summer had
not yet even peeped in, and after feeding their cows
there, they returned home in the evening. But, one even-
ing they led back with them the cows used by the sage for
his Pūjās. When the sun set, as usual the sage sat before
the sacred fire for Pūjā. But, the cow had not come.
With his divine vision he found out the reason for the
absence of the cow. He cursed that the region where
the keepers of the cows lived be turned into a desert,
and the kingdom of Kāśī became a desert place, where-
upon king Divodāsa went to the banks of the Gomatī
and founded a new kingdom there. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa
Chapter 2).
