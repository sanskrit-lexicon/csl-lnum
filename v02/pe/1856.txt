DEVAŚARMĀ II¦. A Brahmin, an erudite scholar in the
Vedas. His story was once told to Pārvatī by Śiva as
follows:—
<div n="NI"/>Devaśarman, the very erudite brahmin scholar in the
Vedas came to be much respected by the people of the
four varṇas (Castes) because of his constant and unfail-
ing performance of the various religious duties and
rites like the Agnihotra etc. He had sons, relations and
cows in abundance. But, he did not observe the śukla-
pañcamī in Proṣṭhapada (Bhādrapada) which is one of
[Page212-b+ 65]
the dvādaśacāndra māsas (the 12 solar months).
That day was his father's death anniversary (Śrāddha
day) for which he would invite Brahmins on the pre-
vious evening. And, in the morning he would get cook-
ed rice by his wife in 18 different ways for the gratifica-
tion of the departed soul. Then will he feed the
Brāhmins. On one such day he duly treated a Brāhmin
versed in the Vedas. In the evening when he
was washing his feet with water brought by his wife
he heard the following conversation between a dog
and an ox.
<div n="NI"/>{%Dog :%}—Please attend to my words about what my
daughter-in-law did. One day, as fate would have it,
I went to my son's house, where a snake was drinking
milk, and I drank the whole of the milk which was left
over by it. My daughter-in-law saw me drinking it and
I was absolutely crest-fallen. I don't feel any yearning
even for food.
<div n="NI"/>{%Ox :%}—Now dog, please attend to my sorrow and grief.
Today my son feasted the Brahmins, but he did not even
think of me. Nobody gave me even a blade of grass or
a drop of water. I have not tasted anything today.
Moreover I am a captive also. All this must be the result
of some sin committed by me in my past life; no doubt
about it.”
<div n="NI"/>The very learned and intelligent brahmin inferred from
the above talk that the dog and ox were his mother and
his father respectively. He thought to himself: they have
been born as animals in my house. What remedy shall
I find out therefor?
<div n="NI"/>On account of such painful thoughts the Brahmin could
not sleep in the night. Early in the morning he went
to sage Vasiṣṭha and unburdened his heart to him and
requested him to find a solution to the low and mean
birth which had become his parents’ fate. After medita-
ting for some time the great sage told the brahmin as
follows:—
<div n="NI"/>“Look here, the ox was, in its previous birth, a great
brahmin in Kuṇḍinanagara. He did not observe the
Śukla-pañcamī in the month of Proṣṭhapada, the day
being the death anniversary of his father. His wife had
menstruation on the same day, but she herself feasted
the Brahmins. A woman is impure during the four days
of menstruation. Because of having feasted the Brah-
mins on the first day of her monthly period the Brah-
min's wife was born as a dog. As for the husband, he
was born an ox as he not only did not observe the
Śukla-pañcamī day, but also shared the sin of his wife.
Further questioned by the brahmin as to what he should
do for the salvation of his parents, Vasiṣṭha advised him
to observe the Ṛṣi pañcamī in the month of Proṣṭhapada
(Bhādrapada). He did so and his parents blessed him
and attained salvation. (Padma Purāṇa, Chapter 78).
