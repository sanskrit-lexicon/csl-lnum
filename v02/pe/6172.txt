ŚAṄKARĀCĀRYA¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} The spiritual and philosophical preceptor
of India. Śrī Śaṅkara was born in the village of Kālaṭi
on the banks of the holy river Periyār, also called
Cūrṇā and Pūrṇā. According to certain scholars he was
born in 509 B.C. while certain others contend that he
saw the light of day in 84 A.D. Yet others place his
date of birth in various periods between 509 B.C. and 84
A.D. Whatever that may be, the great ācārya is be-
lieved to have lived only for 32 years.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} The name of Śaṅkara's father was Śivaguru
and that of his mother Āryāmbā. This nambūdiri couple
had no issues for a long time. So they went to Tṛśśiva-
perūr (Trichur) to worship Śiva in the famous Śiva
temple there. The idol in that temple is known as
Vṛṣācaleśvara and Vaṭakkunnātha also. Ere long Lord
Śiva blessed them with a son. The belief is still held
that, pleased with the prayer of Śivaguru and Āryāmbā
Śiva himself was born as their son. The child began
exhibiting extraordinary intellectual powers. At the age
of five the boy Śaṅkara was invested with the sacred
thread. By the time he was eight years old he had
earned deep erudition in the Vedas, Śāstras, Purāṇas,
epics (itihāsas) etc. His father was no more by then
and on the mother devolved the duty of bringing the
child up.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Crocodile-attack.%} The boy showed no taste for or
interest in childish plays, but evinced a tendency to-
wards a life of renunciation. This attitude of the son
pained the mother much and she wanted her son to get
married. But, the boy did not like the idea. As fate
would have it, an incident which proved to be a turning
point in the boy's life occurred soon. One day the
mother and her son were bathing in the Periyār,
when a crocodile caught hold of the boy. He cried
aloud, and the mother got greatly alarmed. There was a
custom for one to take to sannyāsa, irrespective of circum-
stances, when danger or death threatened one, and that
is called āpatsannyāsa. Śaṅkara prayed to his mother
for permission to take to sannyāsa at that moment when
his end was near, and willy-nilly the mother granted per-
mission. All at once the crocodile, which had so unex-
[Page685-b+ 63]
pectedly attacked him, disappeared equally unexpectedly.
The boy came out of the river absolutely unhurt. The
decision to take to sannyāsa was taken once for all.
Śaṅkara assured his mother, before he started on a tour
of the country, that he would be present at her bedside
during her last days and also that he would duly perform
her obsequies.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%In the presence of the preceptor.%} Śaṅkara, who then
was not even seven years old, started for the north in
quest of a preceptor, and on the banks of the Narmadā
he saw Govinda-bhagavatpāda, the disciple of Śrī
Gauḍapāda. The Bhagavatpāda was sitting in a cave
surrounded by many wise people. Śaṅkara approached
and requested him to admit him as a disciple and grant
him sannyāsa. Śaṅkara's prayer was granted.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Controlled flood.%} A wonderful thing happened while
Śaṅkara was living at the āśrama. The Narmadā was
in spate and the huts on its banks were about to be
submerged in water. People got alarmed. Then Śaṅkara
put his kamaṇḍalu (vessel which sannyāsins keep with
them for water) and chanted the Jalākarṣaṇa Mantra.
(hymn to attract water). At once the water which had
flooded the banks flowed back into the river. People
and their huts were saved. Afterwards his Guru asked
Śaṅkara to go to and live in Kāśī and write Bhāṣyas
(commentaries) on the Prasthānatrayam, i.e. the Brahma-
sūtras, the Upaniṣads and the Gītā.
<div n="NI"/>6) {%Padmapāda.%} Accordingly Śaṅkara went to Kāśī. It
was there that he took as his first disciple Viṣṇuśarman,
a young man from the Cola region of the country.
Śaṅkara called him Sanandana. Afterwards other disci-
ples also came in. But, gradually jealousies cropped
up in the ranks of the disciples. The other disciples of
Śaṅkara thought that the latter was partial towards
Sanandana and showed special affection and regards
to him. Śaṅkara then decided to prove to the others
that Sanandana was a disciple of exceptional talents and
merits. One day Śaṅkara was bathing with his other
disciples in the Gaṅgā, and he called Sanandana who
was on the other side of the river to go to him. Sanan-
dana walked on the surface of the water to his Guru,
and as he took each step a lotus flower appeared beneath
and held him up from sinking into the water. From
that day onwards he came to be called Padmapāda,
and his colleagues also realised his greatness.
<div n="NI"/>7) {%Hastāmalaka.%} Hastāmalaka was one of the best disci-
ples of Śaṅkara. There is a story about his becoming
Śaṅkara's disciple. He was born dumb. His father,
Divākara took Hastāmalaka to Śaṅkara believing that
due to the blessing of the great Guru his son would gain
powers of speech. Śaṅkara asked the dumb boy, ‘who
are you?’ and the boy answered, ‘I am the soul, which
has no relationship with the parts and attributes of body
and mind and which is also entirely different from them’.
There were certain verses, which the boy recited as
answer to Śaṅkara's question and each verse ended with
‘nityopalabdhisvarūpohamātmā’ (I am the ātman and
eternal knowledge, consciousness, is its characteristic).
The boy's answer pleased Śaṅkara, who took him as a
disciple of his. The boy was given sannyāsa under
the name Hastāmalaka the meaning of which word is
he who is in possession of knowledge like the goose-
berry in one's palm.
[Page686-a+ 64]
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Toṭakācārya.%} Toṭakācārya was a disciple, who came
soon after Hastāmalaka. The name Toṭakācārya has a
story behind it. This disciple approached Śaṅkara with
his request for discipleship in verse praising the latter.
The verses were composed in the difficult toṭaka metre.
The verses attracted Śaṅkara very much and he took the
applicant as disciple. His real name was Kalānātha, but
the Guru named him Toṭakācārya in view of his verses
in that metre.
<div n="NI"/>9) {%The Caṇḍālaguru.%} There is a story about Śiva going
to Śaṅkara at Kāśī in the guise of a Caṇḍāla and
Śaṅkara receiving him. One morning Śaṅkara, after
bathing in the Gaṅgā, was returning to the Viśvanātha
temple. A Caṇḍāla with his hunting dogs and a pot of
liquor was advancing from the opposite direction of
Śaṅkara, who asked the former to move away from his
path. Immediately the Caṇḍāla asked, which, the
body or soul, is to remove itself from the path? The
body of everybody is composed of blood, flesh, bones
etc; the constitution of it also is the same. But, the
Ātman is universal and omnipresent. Whom-which of
the two-are you asking to move away from your path?
Śaṅkara realised from the above answer that the Caṇḍāla
was an extraordinary person. In fact, it was Siva, who
had disguised himself as a Caṇḍāla. Śaṅkara prostrated
before him. Śaṅkara thought about God saying that
he who had attained Brahman and the consciousness
of oneness with all, was his Guru, whether he be a
Brahmin or a Caṇḍāla.
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Derisive of the grammarian.%} Śaṅkara has composed
a hymn named Mohamudgara, in which he ridicules a
grammarian. One day walking along a street in Kāśī
Śaṅkara saw a grammarian learning by rote rules of
grammar, and then he composed the very sweet and beauti-
ful poem—Bhaja Govindam—to reveal the foolishness
of the grammarian repeating the useless rules of gram-
mar. By the very first verse of the poem Śaṅkara revealed
the following truth: “Oh! fool! worship Govinda
(Bhaja Govindam) meditate upon Him. You meditate
upon Govinda realising the truth that when death
approaches, the grammatical sūtra “Ḍukṛñ Karaṇe” will
not come to your aid.”
<div n="NI"/>11) {%Saw Vyāsa.%} Śiva, when he appeared in the guise
of a Caṇḍāla to Śaṅkara, had asked him to visit Badari-
kāśrama, and accordingly he went there and visited
Vyāsa. It was there that Śaṅkara met his supreme
preceptor, Govindapāda. He returned to Kāśī with the
blessings of Vyāsa and Govindapāda and engaged him-
self in the writing of books.
<div n="NI"/>12) {%Śaṅkara's age.%} There is a legend about Śaṅkara's
life. Brahmā had allotted to him only eight years' life.
Before Śaṅkara left his house at Kālaṭi, a batch of
sannyāsins including Agastya and Nārada came to the
house. The sannyāsins, who were pleased with the
reception accorded to them blessed Śaṅkara to live for
sixteen years instead of the eight Brahmā had permitted
him.
<div n="NI"/>While Śaṅkara was writing books at Muktimaṇḍapa at
Maṇikarṇikā Ghat in Kāśī Vyāsa came there one day
in the guise of an old man, and there ensued a lengthy
discussion between the two. Padmapāda recognised
Vyāsa in the old man and told him and Śaṅkara thus:
“How would there be peace and happiness in the world,
if Śaṅkara, the incarnation of Śiva and Vedavyāsa, the
[Page686-b+ 64]
incarnation of Viṣṇu quarrelled with each other?” As
soon as his identity was revealed thus, Vyāsa admitted
that Śaṅkara's Bhāṣya on the Brahmasūtras was cor-
rect and blessed him to live for thirtytwo, instead of
sixteen years.
<div n="NI"/>13) {%Controversy between Śaṅkara and Maṇḍanamiśra.%}
Pandits (scholars) view the controversy or discussion
between Śaṅkara and Maṇḍanamiśra as the most impor-
tant event in Śaṅkara's life. Three incidents, Śaṅkara's
meeting Kumārilabhaṭṭa, his defeating Maṇḍanamiśra
and his entering the dead body of another person—may
be found in connection with the above controversy.
<div n="NI"/>{%A: Meeting with Kumārilabhaṭṭa.%} Śaṅkara's object was
to expose the defects and draw-backs in Pūrvamīmāṃsā
(the ritual part of the Vedas). Kumārilabhaṭṭa was the
most competent person for a discussion on the subject.
Śaṅkara, for this purpose, went to Prayāga from Kāśī.
But, Kumārilabhaṭṭa was not in a condition fit for dis-
cussion. He was slowly burning himself to death in a
heap of paddy husk set on fire. He courted this punish-
ment voluntarily to atone for a wrong he had commit-
ted. Years back he had put on Buddhistic attire and
studied the secrets of Buddhistic religion from its precep-
tors with the object of refuting that religion. Kumā-
rilabhaṭṭa had great faith in Karmakāṇḍa, and he
therefore, decided that it was his duty to make a tone-
ment for the wrong he had purposely done according
to injunctions laid down in Karmakāṇḍa. Śaṅkara was
very sorry to find Kumārilabhaṭṭa in this condition in
which discussion could not be held with him on the
defects of Pūrvamīmāṃsā. Kumārilabhaṭṭa directed
Śaṅkara to the great scholar, Maṇḍanamiśra at Māhiṣ-
matī for a discussion on Pūrvamīmāṃsā.
<div n="NI"/>{%B. Maṇḍanamiśra defeated.%} When Śaṅkara reached
Maṇḍanamiśra's house a ceremony connected with
obsequies was being conducted there. The door for
entry to the house was closed. Śaṅkara, by his yogic
power entered the home and revealed the object of his
visit to Maṇḍanamiśra, who agreed to the proposal of
Śaṅkara. Accordingly a debate began between the two.
Bhāratīdevī, wife of Maṇḍanamiśra and an erudite
scholar in her own title acted as the arbiter in the discus-
sion. Before the debate started she put a garland of
flowers on the neck of both the contenders and announc-
ed that he would be considered as defeated in the
debate the garland on whose neck began fading first.
The debate continued for a number of days and the
garland on Maṇḍanamiśra's neck began showing signs
of fading. According to the terms and conditions of
the debate Maṇḍanamiśra acknowledged defeat. He
accepted Śaṅkara's discipleship.
<div n="NI"/>{%C. Parakāyapraveśa (Entering the dead body of another%}
{%person).%} But, Bhāratīdevī argued that it was not enough
that Śaṅkara had defeated her husband in debate. She
challenged him to defeat her as well, and Śaṅkara
accepted the challenge. Many topics dealt with in
the various Śāstras were debated upon and Śaṅkara
won all those debates. Ultimately Bhāratīdevī raised
certain points connected with the science of sexual
love in the course of her arguments. Śaṅkara admitted
that he did not possess sufficient mastery over the
subject as he had taken himself to sannyāsa even from
infancy. But, he told her that if he was allowed neces-
sary time for it he would debate on that topic also.
[Page687-a+ 65]
Bhāratīdevī granted him time for it and the debate
was adjourned.
<div n="NI"/>Śaṅkara prepared himself for the study of the science
of sexual love. Just at that time a King called Amaruka
died. After asking his disciples to take especial care
of his body Śaṅkara entered by yogic power the dead
body of Amaruka. The dead King came back to
life and his people felt very happy about the mysteri-
ous happening. Śaṅkara, who had thus entered the
body of King Amaruka, lived in the palace enjoying
all royal pleasures. He gained practical experience
in the matter of sexual love from the queens in the
palace. People found the resurrected King Amaruka
to be better and more intelligent. The ministers suspect-
ed that the soul which dwelt in the body of the king
was of some one else. Under the impression
that it might be that of some yogin the ministers
deputed agents to various parts of the country to find
out if there was anywhere the dead body of a yogī, and
they found out Śaṅkara's body. It was about to be
burnt on the pyre when the disciples of Śaṅkara met
King Amaruka at the palace and informed him about
these developments. Immediately Śaṅkara quitted
his royal body and entered his own body now lying on
the funeral pyre. He prayed to Śrīlakṣmīnarasiṃha and
came out from the burning pyre.
<div n="NI"/>Śaṅkara returned immediately to Maṇḍanamiśra's
house and the debate was started again. Bhāratīdevī
realised that Śaṅkara could not be defeated in topics
related to the science of sex. Thus Śaṅkara gained
absolute victory in his debate with Maṇḍanamiśra, who
then requested the former to grant him sannyāsa and
accept him as a disciple. Śaṅkara did so. Bhāratīdevī
too followed her husband in accepting sannyāsa.
<div n="NI"/>14) {%Mother's death.%} Śaṅkara now knew that it was time
for his mother's death. According to his promise to
her that he would be by her side at the time of her
death Śaṅkara returned to Kālaṭi. His mother expired,
and he made arrangements for cremation. But his rela-
tions did not cooperate with him and argued that it was
against the injunctions in the Śāstras for a son, who had
taken to sannyāsa, to perform the cremation etc. of his
mother. At last, Śaṅkara had to cremate his mother by
himself without others' help. He made a pyre with plan-
tain stems in the compound of his house, and cut his
mother's corpse into pieces, carried the pieces to the
funeral pyre and thus cremated the body.
<div n="NI"/>15) {%Triumphal tour.%} After the cremation of his mother
Śaṅkara set out on his triumphal tour of the country.
He is believed to have travelled throughout India three
times. Wherever he went he gained friends and also
made enemies. It was during these tours that he esta-
blished the four maṭhas (centres) in the four regions
of the country. Śṛṅgeri in the south, Jaganātha in the
east, Dvārakā in the west and Badarīnātha in the north
were the four chief maṭhas established by Śaṅkara and
they continue to function even to this day.
<div n="NI"/>The Śiva, Viṣṇu and Devī temples and other Hindu
religious institutions to be found in India today very
eloquently proclaim the achievements and unique
reputation of Śaṅkara. It is traditionally believed that
Śaṅkara brought five liṅgas from Kailāsa and installed
them in the five great temples. Muktiliṅga in Kedāra,
Paraliṅga in the Nīlakaṇṭha temple in Nepal, Mokṣa
liṅga at Cidambaram, Bhogaliṅga in Śṛṅgeri and
[Page687-b+ 65]
Yogaliṅga in Kāñcī are the five liṅgas installed by
Śaṅkara. The ‘five-in-one’ method of worship was
also propounded by him. According to this system
Āditya, Ambikā, Viṣṇu, Gaṇanātha and Maheśvara
are conjointly worshipped, special importance being
given by the worshipper to his special deity. Śaṅkara
appointed one disciple of his each in each of the maṭhas
as its head and these maṭhas play the most important role
in the maintenance and propagation of the Advaita philo-
sophy. The heads of these maṭhas during various periods
have been reputed Vedāntists and noble souls. Jyotir-
maṭha in Badarikāśrama, Govardhana pīṭha in Jagan-
nāthapurī, Śāradā pīṭha in Śṛṅgeri and Kāmakoṭipīṭha
in Kāñcī are the most important of the Śrī Śaṅkara pīṭhas.
Having thus completed his philosophic mission or object
in life Śaṅkara entered mahāsamādhi at the age of thirty-
two. Some scholars believe that he disappeared in a
cave at Kedāra while certain others hold the view that
he ascended the Sarvajñapīṭha (the omniscient state) at
Kāñcī and spent his closing days there.
<div n="NI"/>16) {%His works.%} The literary compositions of Śaṅkara may
be classified into four divisions, viz, Bhāṣyas (comment-
aries), original works, hymns to various deities, and
mantras.
