BHARADVĀJA II¦. The sage Bharadvāja of Purāṇic
fame.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa of Kampa
Rāmāyaṇa states that this sage was the son of Atri
Maharṣi. He lived for many thousands of years. He is
connected with Vālmīki and the story of Śrī Rāma.
Bharadvāja was for many years a disciple of Vālmīki.
He was present with Vālmīki when the hunter killed
one of the couple of Krauñca. When Vālmīki and
Bharadvāja reached the shores of the river, Tamasā,
that day Vālmīki told Bharadvāja thus: “Look, Bhara-
dvāja, what a clean ghat this is. The water is pure and
clear. Place your water-jug here and give me my
valkala. We will get down here in this sacred water”.
Then Vālmīki taking the valkala from the disciple
walked along the shore admiring the beauty of the
forest trees and found on his way the historic Krauñca
couple. (Sarga 2, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Bharadvāja and the study of Vedas.%} Bharadvāja gave
himself untiringly to the study of the Vedas. He obtain-
ed from Indra a boon to extend his term of life on
earth to many thousands of years by different stages,
each stage covering a span of a thousand years of life.
All these years he devoted to an incessant study of the
Vedas. Finding the term not sufficient for completing
the study of the Vedas he appealed to Indra again for
extension and Indra appearing in person took him before
three mountains and giving him three handfuls of
sand told him thus, “What you have studied about
Vedas till this time is equivalent to the amount of
sand I have now given and what is yet to be studied
about the Vedas is as big as the three mountains before
you”. Any other mortal being would have been dis-
heartened by this revelation made by Indra, but not
Bharadvāja. Undaunted he continued his studies. (Bhāga-
vata).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Bharadvāja in the role of a magician.%} The āśrama of
Bharadvāja was in Citrakūṭa and Śrī Rāma and
Lakṣmaṇa in the beginning of their exile went to his
āśrama accepting his blessings. Bharata on his return
from Kekaya knew about the exile of his brothers and
hoping to bring them back to Ayodhyā went in search
of them with a big retinue of soldiers and men. Keeping
the retinue outside, Bharata went to the āśrama of
Bharadvāja. The latter decided to give Bharata and his
people a grand reception and calling Viśvakarmā to his
side asked him to arrange a royal banquet that night.
Devas, Gandharvas, Apsarases, Aṣṭadikpālas and all
such people were invited for the night. Renowned dancers
from devaloka like Ghṛtācī, Hemā, Viśvācī Miśrakeśī and
Alambuṣā appeared for entertainment. Even Vanarājī
took part in the dance. Dishes of food came to the
guests of their own accord. The night came to an end
wonderfully and at daybreak everything vanished and
all were amazed at the magic of the sage. (Sarga 91,
Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).

dvāja of the celestial woman, Ghṛtācī. (see under
