MADHUVILĀ¦ (MADHUBILĀ). A river which flows in
the neighbourhood of Kardamila kṣetra. This river has
another name Samaṅga. This is a very sacred tīrtha.
Indra who became a Brahmahatyā-sinner by killing
Vṛtrāsura was absolved of his sins by taking a bath in
this river. Aṣṭāvakra, the sage with eight bends in his
body, got himself perfect by taking a bath in this river
obeying the orders of his father Kahoḍaka. (Chapter 135,
Vana Parva).
