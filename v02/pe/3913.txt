<div n="NI"/>2) {%Other information.%} (i) Kuśāmba had a daughter
called Cārvaṅgī, who was married by Bhadraśreṇya,
the solar King. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 2).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Two sons, Śakra and Gādhi were born to Kuśāmba
and to Gādhi was born a daughter, Satyavatī. Viśvā-
mitra was Gādhi's son. (Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter
57).
<div n="NI"/>This statement is not quite correct. Certain other
Purāṇas maintain that Gādhi, the father of Viśvāmitra
was the son of Kuśanābha, who was the son of Kuśika
and brother of Kuśāmba. (See under Kuśanābha).
