CITRARATHA III¦. A king of Sālva. Once Reṇukā,
wife of Jamadagni, after her bath in the river stayed
ashore watching this king and his queen bathe in the
river with erotic plays. Reṇukā thus reached the āśrama
a bit late and Jamadagni enraged at this commanded
his son Paraśurāma to chop the head of his own mother.
(Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 59).
