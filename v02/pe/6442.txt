SATYABHĀMĀ¦. The wife of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Introduction.%} Once Śrī Kṛṣṇa himself said about the
previous birth of Satyabhāmā. There was an occasion
for saying that.
<div n="NI"/>Once Nārada came from the world of the gods to
Dvārakā. He had brought with him some flowers of
the Kalpaka tree. Nārada gave all those flowers to
Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Śrī Kṛṣṇa divided them among his wives,
but he had forgotten Satyabhāmā. Being unable to
subdue her sorrow and anger she got into her bedroom
and wept and sighed and lay there. Śrī Kṛṣṇa came to
know of this. He took Satyabhāmā with him on the
back of Garuḍa and went to the world of Gods. They
reached there and asked Indra for some Kahlāra
flowers. Indra refused to give. Garuḍa got ready to
[Page704-b+ 65]
uproot the tree. Then Indra wielded his thunderbolt.
To honour the weapon thunderbolt, Garuḍa left a
feather of his there and returned to Dvārakā. Because
of the hitting of the thunderbolt, the peacock, mon-
goose and jungle crow were born from Garuḍa. Śrī
Kṛṣṇa who won the war, returned with Satyabhāmā
mounted on Garuḍa, to Dvārakā. The Kalpaka tree
brought from the world of gods, was planted in the
garden in front of the palace of Satyabhāmā. When
Śrī Kṛṣṇa and the Kalpaka tree became her own,
Satyabhāmā became proud. At that time Nārada
came there. She asked Nārada what she should do so
as to have Śrī Kṛṣṇa and the Kalpaka tree with her in
all births. Nārada said that, for that, she had only to
do Tulāpuruṣadāna. She instantly placed Śrī Kṛṣṇa
and the Kalpaka tree in the balance and all the things
placed in equal weight were given to Nārada himself.
Nārada received them and went to the world of Gods.
Satyabhāmā became overjoyed. She asked Śrī Kṛṣṇa,
what good deeds she had done to earn so much happi-
ness. Śrī Kṛṣṇa described the previous birth of Satya-
bhāmā. (Padma Purāṇa, Uttara Khaṇḍa, Chapter 90).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Previous birth of Satyabhāmā.%} Towards the close of
the Kṛtayuga, there was a Brahmin named Devaśarmā
who was born of the clan of Agni in Māyāpurī. This
Brahmin was well-versed in the Vedas and the
Vedāṅgas. In the old age a daughter named Guṇavatī
was born to him. He gave his daughter to his
disciple Candraśarmā.
<div n="NI"/>Once Devaśarmā and Candraśarmā went to the forest
to bring Darbha (poa) and Samit (butea). While they
were walking here and there in the Mango grove in
the Himālayas a giant closed with them. Because of
terror their bodies were stiffened and so they could not
run. The fierce giant killed both of them. The escorts
sent by Viṣṇu came and took both of them to Vaikuṇ-
ṭha. Guṇavatī cried aloud when she heard that her
father and husband were killed by a giant. She
lamented for a long while and then fainted and fell
down. When she came to herself she began to cry
again. At last she sold the furniture and conducted
the funeral rites of her father and husband. After that
she lived by manual labour. She observed fast and the
vow of Kṛttikā and Ekādaśī.
<div n="NI"/>Guṇavatī, who was weak and lean because of old age
and fever once walked slowly to the river Ganges to
bathe. When she got into the river she shivered be-
cause of cold. Then an aerial chariot came down
from the sky. The messengers of Viṣṇu took her in
the chariot, to Vaikuṇṭha. The celestial maids fanned
her with the whisk of yak. After this Mahāviṣṇu in-
carnated as Śrī Kṛṣṇa to destroy the wicked. Those
who were the dependants of Viṣṇu in Vaikuṇṭha took
birth in Dvārakā. Devaśarmā the father of Guṇavatī took
birth as Satrājit. Candraśarmā became Akrūra. Guṇa-
vatī became Satyabhāmā. Because of the goodness earned
by the fast of Kṛttikā, she had become a beloved one of
Viṣṇu. Because she made a grove of holy basil (tulasī)
at the gate of Viṣṇu in the previous birth the Kalpaka
tree came to her garden in this birth. Because she
lighted lamps in Kārttika month Mahālakṣmī lives
permanently in her house. Because she did fast and
vow in Kārttika imagining Viṣṇu as her husband, she
became the wife of Śrī Kṛṣṇa in this birth. (Padma
Purāṇa, Uttara Khaṇḍa, Chapter 91).
