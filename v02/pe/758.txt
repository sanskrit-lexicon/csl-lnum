ĀRṢṬIṢEṆA¦. A Maharṣi. In the Mahābhārata, Vana
Parva, Chapter 159 there is a reference to the Pāṇḍavas
visiting this sage during their life in the forest. Ārṣṭi-
ṣeṇa's āśrama was midway between Badaryāśrama and
Kubera's capital.
<div n="NI"/>{%Power of Tapas.%} In Kṛtayuga this sage did rigorous
tapas in Pṛthūdakatīrtha. Owing to the rigour of the
tapas he obtained all the chief vedas. He gave three
boons to that sacred tīrtha:—
<div n="NI"/>1. Those who bathe in this tīrtha will get the benefit of
Aśvamedha yāga.
<div n="NI"/>2. There will be no fear of snakes in this tīrtha.
<div n="NI"/>3. A slight effort made here, will be rewarded with
greater results.
<div n="NI"/>After giving these three boons to the river Sarasvatī
which is Pṛthūdakatīrtha the sage attained Brahmin-
hood and entered Devaloka. (M.B., Śalya Parva,
Chapter 40, Verses 3-9).
