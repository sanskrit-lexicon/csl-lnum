NALA III¦. A monkey. This monkey was the son of
Viśvakarmā. Śrī Rāma and the monkey-army went to
redeem Sītā from Laṅkā and reached the sea-shore. A
bridge had to be made to cross the sea and reach
Laṅkā. Immediately Varuṇa the King of the seas
appeared there and said, “Nala who is in the monkey-
army, is the son of Viśvakarmā. His father had given
him a blessing that he would become as expert an
architect as his father. So let the construction of the
bridge be commenced under his supervision.” Accord-
ingly under the supervision of Nala, Rāma's bridge of
rock was completed and Śrī Rāma and the army of
monkeys reached Laṅkā by walking over this bridge
(Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha Kāṇḍa, Sarga 22).
<div n="NI"/>In the battle between Rāma and Rāvaṇa, Nala fought
with the giant Tuṇḍaka. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter
285, Stanza 9).
