ŚĀKALYA¦. A maharṣi in the lineage of gurus (precep-
tors). (See under Guruparamparā). He systematised
the Vedasaṃhitās. It was Bādarāyaṇakṛṣṇa, who
became later famous as Vedavyāsa, who first arranged
in systematic order the Vedasaṃhitās. Prominent
scholars hold the view that Vyāsa lived between 1300-
1500 B.C. The saṃhitā text now popular systematised
by Śākalya is called Śākalya śākhā (Śākalya branch).
Śākalya is reported to have saved Kaśyapa maharṣi
once. When king Parīkṣit was cursed that he would
die by Takṣaka's poison Kaśyapa started for his court
to save the king from the calamity. But, Takṣaka met
him on the way and sent him back laden with presents
of gems, ornaments etc. People derided Kaśyapa, who
on account of covetousness, retreated from the duty of
saving the king's life and non-cooperated with him in
every way. In this contingency Kaśyapa sought the
help of Śākalya, who advised the former to bathe in the
sacred tīrthas in the rivers Godāvarī and Sarasvatī.
Kaśyapa did so and regained his old reputation.
