SAṂVAHA¦. A wind which moves the aerial chariots of
the Devas. According to Vyāsa there are seven winds.
While once he was teaching his son Śuka Vedas, a
storm blew and the teaching had to be stopped for
some time. Then Śuka asked his father about winds,
and Vyāsa answered as follows:
<div n="NI"/>There are seven vāyus (winds). The first one called
Pravaha moves the clouds. The second one, Āvaha,
causes thunder while the third vāyu, Udvaha, converts
sea-water into vapour and causes rain. The fourth
one Saṃvaha moves clouds in the sky. The clouds are
the aeroplanes of the Devas. The fifth is Vivaha, which
gives form and shape to the clouds. The sixth Vāyu,
Parivaha, keeps Ākāśagaṅgā motionless while due to
the action of the seventh Vāyu, Parāvaha, the souls
travel. (Śānti Parva, Chapter 329).
