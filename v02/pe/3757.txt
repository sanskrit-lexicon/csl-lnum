KUCELA¦. Sudāman, better known as Kucela was a
brahmin class-mate of Śrī Kṛṣṇa at the Āśrama of
sage Sāndīpani. One day Sāndīpani's wife deputed
Kucela and Kṛṣṇa to collect fire-wood from the forest,
and they had to stay the whole night there as they
could not find out the way back to the āśrama due to
heavy rain, thunder etc. After their education was
over these two thick friends left the āśrama and went
their different ways in life.

house-holder with many children, and starvation
gripped the family. One day, at the instance of his
wife, Kucela started for Dvārakā to visit Kṛṣṇa with a
packet of rice flakes as a present to him. Kṛṣṇa receiv-
ed his old classmate most cordially, and ate one hand-
ful of rice flakes from the packet brought by Kucela.
Rukmiṇī prevented him from a second helping of the
flakes. After spending some time most happily with his
old friend, Kucela started homewards. Only on his
way back did he think that Kṛṣṇa had not given him
any monetary help. But, by the time he reached home
his old dilapidated house had converted itself into a
beautiful mansion, and his wife and children were in
great happiness. Śrī Kṛṣṇa's blessings thus converted
poor Kucela into a very rich person. (Bhāgavata, 10th
Skandha).
