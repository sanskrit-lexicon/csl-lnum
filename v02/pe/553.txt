AṢṬAVIVĀHA¦(S). Eight kinds of marriage. (1) Brāhma
(2) Daiva (3) Ārṣa (4) Prājāpatya (5) Gāndharva
(6) Āsura (7) Rākṣasa (8) Paiśāca. Brāhma is the one
where the father gives her daughter with sacred water
to a bachelor without accepting anything in return. When
the father gives his daughter to the priest at the time
of a yāga it is called Daiva. It is Ārṣa if the father gives
the daughter and gets in return a cow or bullock. When
the father gives the daughter with her blessings it is
Prājāpatya. The marriage between two lovers is Gān-
dharva. It is Āsura when the male takes his mate by
force and it is Paiśācika (most cruel and mean) when
the girl is taken as his wife when she is in a state of
unconsciousness.
