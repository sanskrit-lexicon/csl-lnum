UDAPĀNA¦ TĪRTHA. A holy bath on the bank of the
river Sarasvatī. It is said that Balabhadra Rāma,
while going on a pilgrimage, had visited this holy bath.
There is a story showing how this place became a
holy bath. Long ago there was a hermit named Gautama,
who had three sons called Ekata, Dvita and Trita.
The father was much pleased at the dutiful and devo-
tional character of his sons. One day he performed a
sacrifice and went to heaven. Then the kings and the
priests who were present for the sacrifice began to
honour and respect Trita. Ekata and Dvita did not
like this. The three brothers performed sacrifices and
acquired a large number of cows. With these cows
they started for the east. Trita walked before. Ekata
and Dvita who were behind, made a consultation and
drove the cows another way. Trita walked on in front,
alone. On the bank of the Sarasvatī he saw a wolf and
getting terrified, he fell into a well in which there was
no water. Standing in the well, he imagined a creeper
[Page801-a+ 65]
that was hanging to the well as ‘Soma’ (a herb used as
oblation in sacrifice) and performed sacrifice, chanting
the Vedas. His chanting was heard in heaven and
Bṛhaspati and other gods came to him and asked him
what boon he desired. Trita told them that he only
wanted to be saved from the well. Immediately the
river Sarasvatī flowed into the well and the waves began
to swell. Standing on the waves he praised and glori-
fied the gods. Then he returned home and cursed
Ekata and Dvita and transmuted them into wolves.
Trita said that their children would become monkeys
and cattle. It happened so. The place where the Gods
appeared before Trita, became famous and got the name
Udapānatīrtha. (M.B. Śalya Parva, Chapter 36).
