<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin.%} In both Hindu and Christian scriptures,
the story about the origin of woman appears to be
similar. It is stated in Manusmṛti, Chapter 1, Verse
32, that Brahmā divided his body into two and made
one part male and the other part female and the male
embraced the female, from which union was born the
Virāṭpuruṣa.

<div n="NI"/>In the book of Genesis in the Bible, the origin of the
first woman is given. It is somewhat similar to the one
given above. God created Adam as the first man. God
caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam. Then he took
a rib from Adam, made a woman with it, and gave
that woman, who was called Eve, to Adam as wife.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Fascination.%} A story as given below occurs in Devī
Purāṇa, which states how woman acquired fascination.
Once Indra prohibited Aśvinīdevas from drinking the
liquor called Soma. They complained to the hermit
Cyavana, who agreed to recover for them the lost
right, for which purpose he began a sacrifice. Indra
caused obstruction to the sacrifice. Instantly by the
power of Cyavana, an asura named Mada rose up from
the sacrificial fire. Finally Indra begged the hermit for
pardon. Cyavana divided the asura into four parts
and placed one portion in gambling, one portion in
hunting, the third portion in liquor and the fourth
part in woman. Thenceforward woman began to have
fascination.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Manu, about women.%} The following is the place in
society of women in ancient days, according to Manu.
Husband or relatives should give women no freedom.
Even if they became immoral, they should be kept
under the control of men. As woman has to be under
the protection of father in childhood, under the pro-
tection of husband in youth and under the protection of
son in old age, she does not deserve freedom at any time.
<Poem>“Pitā rakṣati kaumāre
Bhartā rakṣati yauvane /
Rakṣanti sthāvire putrāḥ
Na strī svātantryamarhati.”</Poem>
[Page744-b+ 65]
The father who does not give his daughter to a suitable
husband before she attains puberty, the husband who
does not engage in coition with his wife after puberty,
and the son who does not support his mother after the
death of her husband, are men of mean character.
(Manusmṛti, Chapter 9).
