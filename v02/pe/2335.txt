GĀṆḌĪVA¦. The famous bow of Arjuna.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Make.%} It was Brahmā who made the bow. ‘This
terrible bow which can punish the unjust and the
wicked has been made by Brahmā’. (Udyoga Parva,
Chapter 98, Verse 21).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Specialities of Gāṇḍīva.%} This bow is enough to fight
one lakh of people at one and the same time. Both
Devas and men could be defeated with it. Chiselled
very smooth and shining with many colours it was a
very long bow. It was worshipped by Devas, Dānavas
and Gandharvas. (Virāṭa Parva, Chapter 43). It
gained and also decreased in power as the situation
called for. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 98, Verse 20).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%History of Gāṇḍīva.%} Brahmā, who made this bow
kept it with him during the first 1000 years. For the
next 1000 years Prajāpati kept it with him. Next, Indra
got it from Prajāpati and he used it for 3585 years.
After that Candra kept it for 500 years with him, and
then Varuṇa came in possession of it. After using it for
100 years Varuṇa gave it to Arjuna, who used it for 65
years.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Gāṇḍīva and Arjuna.%} Arjuna agreed to protect the
Khāṇḍava forest from rain, if Indra sent rain when
Agni began eating the forest. But, realising that Arjuna
possessed no weapons to effectively oppose Indra, Agni
requested Varuṇa to give the following to Arjuna, viz.,
the Gāṇḍīva bow and a quiver wherein the arrows
will never be exhausted, and the chariot marked with
the symbol of monkey and drawn by four white horses
-all kept by Candra. Varuṇa at once made a present
of the above to Arjuna. And, it was with the aid of this
Gāṇḍīva, that Arjuna defeated Indra at the time of
Khāṇḍavadāha. (See Khāṇḍavadāha). Arjuna had
taken a secret vow to cut off the head of anyone who
asked him to give the bow to some one else. (Karṇa
Parva, Chapter 69).
<div n="NI"/>In after years Arjuna won many wars with the help of
this bow. (See Arjuna).
<div n="NI"/>5) {%Arjuna gives up Gāṇḍīva.%} The great Kurukṣetra war,
which shook Bhārata, to its very foundation came to an
end. Dharmaputra was crowned a King. It was at this
juncture that the Yādava dynasty got itself anni-
[Page276-b+ 65]
hilated and Śrī Kṛṣṇa entered mahāsamādhi. Now the
Pāṇḍavas lost all interest in mundane life, and they
set out for the forest on their great journey after crown-
ing Parīkṣit, the grandson of Arjuna as King. Their
great travel took them to the shores of the Red Sea.
The Gāṇḍīva was still in Arjuna's hands. On the shores
of the Red Sea Agni Deva appeared before the Pāṇḍa-
vas and spoke to them “Well, Pāṇḍavas, I am Agni
Deva. Arjuna requires the Gāṇḍīva no more. I got it
from Varuṇa for Arjuna. Return it, therefore, to
Varuṇa.”
<div n="NI"/>No sooner did he hear Agni Deva speak thus than did
Arjuna throw it into the depths of the sea and also the
quiver which never got exhausted of arrows with it.
Agni Deva disappeared, and the Pāṇḍavas continued
their journey. (Mahāprasthānika Parva, Chapter 1).
