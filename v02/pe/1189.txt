BHUJYU¦. A Rājaṛṣi (royal sage), the son of Tugra.
King Tugra sent his son with an army across the sea to
conquer the enemies in a distant island. When the boat
[Page142-a+ 64]
in which they sailed had reached mid-ocean, it was
caught in a storm and wrecked. The prince and the
soldiers sank into the sea. At that time the prince prayed
to the Aśvins who saved Bhujyu from drowning and
carried him back to the palace in boats and chariots
travelling through the air. This story is given in the
Ṛgveda where the adventures of Aśvins are describ-
ed. (Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala, 17th Anuvāka, 116th
Sūkta.).
