BṚHADRATHA IV¦. Son of Uparicara, the king of
Cedi. Uparicara made his son Bṛhadratha, king of
Magadha. In course of time he became a powerful
emperor. This Bṛhadratha was a mighty warrior-king
with an army of three akṣauhiṇīs (an akṣauhiṇi is a
complete army consisting of 21870 horses and 109350
infantry). Though he had married two daughters of
the King of Kāśi he was childless. The sorrowful king
went with his wives to a hermit named Caṇḍakauśika
and pleased him by giving him precious stones. The
King told the hermit about his sorrow due to lack of
children. The hermit gave them a mango fruit and
said that the King should enthrone the son who would
be born by eating the mango, and return to the forest
for penance. The hermit gave eight boons for the son
who was to be born.
<div n="NI"/>The King and his wives returned to the palace and
divided the mango fruit into two and both of his wives
ate the fruit and became pregnant. Each of them gave
birth to half of a child. The lifeless forms of these half
children were thrown out. A giantess called Jarā put
them together and instantly the pieces joined together
and became a living child. The giantess took that child
and made a present of it to the King. That child grew up
and was known by the famous name Jarāsandha. From
that time onwards Giantess-worship began in Magadha.
When Jarāsandha came of age the King anointed him
as King and went to the hermitage of Caṇḍakauśika
with his wives and began to do penance. After coming
to the forest Bṛhadratha killed a giant named Ṛṣabha
and with his hide made three Big drums and placed
them in the city. The sound of one beat on the drum
will last for a month. When Bhīma, Arjuna and Śrī
Kṛṣṇa came to Magadha to kill Jarāsandha they broke
these drums. (M.B. Ādi Parva, 53; Sabhā Parva,
Chapters 17, 19 and 21).
