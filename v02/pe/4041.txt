MĀDHAVA II¦. Son of Vikrama, King of Tāladhvaja.
The Kriyā Khaṇḍa of Padma Purāṇa gives the follow-
ing story about him.
<div n="NI"/>Mādhava desired to marry a beautiful and good-natur-
ed Kṣatriya girl named Candrakalā. She was not
[Page459-a+ 65]
prepared for that and she informed Mādhava thus:
“There is a princess in the island of Plakṣa named
Sulocanā. She is far more beautiful than myself and
is fit to be your consort. Do try to get her.”
<div n="NI"/>Mādhava accepted the advice of Candrakalā and
started for the island of Plakṣa with a servant of his
named Praceṣṭa. The news that welcomed him when he
reached the island was that the marriage of Sulocanā
had been fixed with one Vidyādhara. Undaunted
Mādhava sent a love-letter to the princess mentioning
his arrival in the city, seeking her hand in marriage.
In reply to that Sulocanā wrote that if Mādhava appear-
ed on the marriage-dais in time she would accept him as
her husband.
<div n="NI"/>The marriage day arrived and Mādhava waited for the
time of the function. But when the auspicious hour
came Mādhava was asleep. Praceṣṭa, his servant, took
advantage of the opportunity and carried away Sulo-
canā. But Sulocanā was determined to marry only
Mādhava and she escaped from the custody of Praceṣṭa
and reached the palace of a King called Suṣeṇa and
stayed there as a servant wearing the robes of a male,
calling himself Vīravara.
<div n="NI"/>Vīravara, i. e. Sulocanā in disguise, saved Vidyādhara
and Praceṣṭa from committing suicide. At that time
Mādhava also in despair was about to commit suicide
when Sulocanā appeared before him in time and stopped
him from doing it. Sulocanā then told him all that had
happened and they were happily united as husband and
wife.
