JĪMŪTAKETU I¦. A synonym of Śiva. There is a story
in the Purāṇas about how Śiva got the name Jīmūta-
ketu.
<div n="NI"/>When summer season began Pārvatī told her husband
Śiva: “My Lord, Summer has set in. What are we to
do without a house to protect us from the hot sun and
the strong wind?” Śiva replied. “Dear! It is because
I have no house that I walk about in the forest
always.”
<div n="NI"/>Because Śiva said so, the loyal wife Satīdevī spent the
summer with her husband in the shade of trees. When
the summer was over rainy season began. People stopp-
ed walking about. The sky became black with clouds.
The roaring sound of thunder was heard everywhere.
Seeing that the rainy season had begun Pārvatī again
request her husband to erect a house. Hearing her
request Śiva replied. “I have no wealth at all to build
a house. You see that I am wearing the hide of a leo-
pard. The serpent Śeṣa is my Brāhma-string. Padma
and Piṅgala are my ear-rings. One of my bracelets for
the upper arm is Kambala and the other one is the
nāga (serpent) Dhanañjaya. My bracelet on the right
hand is Aśvatara and on the left hand is Takṣaka. The
string that I wear round my waist is Nīla, as black as
antimony. So let us go above the clouds and spend the
rainy season there. Then rain will not fall on your
body.”
<div n="NI"/>Saying thus, Śiva got into a lofty cloud with Pārvatī
and sat there. That cloud looked like the flag of Śiva.
Thenceforward Śiva came to be known by the name
Jīmūtaketu. (Vāmana Purāṇa, Chapter).
