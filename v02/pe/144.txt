AKṚTAŚRAMA¦. He is one of the few sannyāsins who
have gone to heaven after completing the fourth āśrama
of life namely, Sannyāsa. The Kaurava-Pāṇḍava
battle was over. As the eldest, Dharmaputra performed
obsequies to all those of his kith and kin dead in the war.
He was then met by many sages including Vyāsa and
Nārada who comforted him in his bereavement. When
Dharmaputra later met Bhīṣma the latter among many
other stories told him the story of Akṛtaśrama also.
