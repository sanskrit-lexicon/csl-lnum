MENĀ I¦. Wife of Himavān. Beautiful Menā was the
daughter of Mahāmeru.
<div n="NI"/>Himavān lord of the mountains and the seat of many
minerals and fossils had two daughters of unparallelled
beauty and their mother was the lovely Menā, daughter
of Mahāmeru and wife of Himavān. (Sarga 35, Bāla
Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>Rāmāyaṇa states that Menā had two daughters of
extraordinary beauty named Gaṅgā and Umā. They
were both married by Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>But Vāmana Purāṇa in chapter 51 states that Menā
had three beautiful daughters and a son named
Sunābha. Menā's first daughter was Rāgiṇī with
red body and eyes and wearing a red dress. Her
second daughter named Kuṭilā was white in colour,
had lotus eyes, and wore white dress. The third was
a girl of enchanting beauty named Kālī. She was
blue-black in colour with eyes like the blue lotus leaf.
<div n="NI"/>It can be surmised that the Umā of Rāmāyaṇa and
Kālī were one and the same person by the following
verse in the Amarakośa.
<Poem>Umā Kātyāyanī Gaurī
Kālī Haimavatīśvarī //</Poem>
<div n="NI"/>When the statements of the two Purāṇas are taken
together Menā should have had four daughters,
Gaṅgā, Rāgiṇī, Kuṭilā and Kālī and a son named
Sunābha.
