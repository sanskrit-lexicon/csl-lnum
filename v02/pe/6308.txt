SARGA¦ (CREATION). Agni Purāṇa, Chapter 20
refers to various sargas as follows.
<div n="NI"/>The first creation is that of greatness (Mahatva) i e.
Brahmā. The second creation is that of tanmātras
called bhūtasarga. The third is Vaikārikasarga also
called Aindriyikasarga. These three kinds of creation
are called Prākṛta sṛṣṭi (natural creation) and that is
conscious and intelligent creation. The fourth is
mukhyasarga. Mukhyas mean immovables. The fifth
is tiryagyonisṛṣṭi. Since it functions side-long it is
called tiryaksrotas. The sixth is the creation of Ūrdhva-
srotas, called devasarga. The seventh is the creation
of arvāksrotas, called mānuṣasarga. The eighth,
anugrahasarga, is both sāttvic and tāmasic. Thus,
vaikṛtasargas are five in number and prākṛtasargas
three. The ninth sarga is the Kaumāra sarga, which
is both vaikṛta and Prākṛta. The fundamental or
root cause of the universe is the above nine creations
of Brahmā. Prākṛtasarga is of three types, nitya
(eternal), naimittika (casual) and dainandina (daily).
Nityasarga is the creation after interim deluges.
