ṚKṢAŚṚṄGA¦. The younger son of Dīrghatapas who
was performing tapas in Mandāravana on the northern
part of Kāśī. Since he was killed by Citrasena, all
others committed suicide. But Dīrghatapas who was
left behind collected their bones, and deposited them in
the sacred Śūlabhedatīrtha. Skanda Purāṇa says that
consequently they attained Heaven.
