MEKHALA¦ (MEKALA). Mekhala was a country which had
attained Purāṇic fame in ancient India. The inhabitants
of this place were called Mekhalas. They were the body-
guards of Bhīṣma. (Chapter 51, Bhīṣma Parva). They
formed a separate division in the army of Bṛhannala,
King of Kosala. (Chapter 87, Bhīṣma Parva). Once
Karṇa conquered this country. (Śloka 8, Chapter 4,
Droṇa Parva). Mekhalas were Kṣatriyas formerly. But
they became persons of low caste when they showed
jealousy towards the brahmins. (Śloka 17, Chapter 35,
Anuśāsana Parva).
