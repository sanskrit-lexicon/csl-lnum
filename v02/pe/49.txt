AGHA¦. The name of an asura. This asura was one of
the followers of Kaṃsa. According to the instructions
of Kaṃsa, Agha once set out to Gokula to kill Śrī
Kṛṣṇa. At that time Śrī Kṛṣṇa was playing on the
banks of the river Kālindī with other cowherds. Aghā-
sura watched the games of the children from the sky
above. Then he transformed himself into a colossal
serpent and lay with his mouth wide open; his open
mouth looked like an immense cave. The foul smell
coming from his mouth soon spread over the whole
place. Śrī Kṛṣṇa and the other children did not know
anything about this. In the course of their games they
walked into the cave-like mouth of Agha and were soon
trapped in his belly. Agha then closed his mouth and
all the boys including Śrī Kṛṣṇa were now imprisoned
inside his body. Some of the boys died. Realizing the
situation Śrī Kṛṣṇa now enlarged his body. His body
grew larger and larger until at last it burst open the body
of the serpent (Agha). Thus Agha was killed. Śrī Kṛṣṇa
then restored the dead boys to life by his divine looks
(Kaṭākṣa). This Aghāsura was the brother of Bakāsura
and Pūtanā. (Bhāgavata, Skandha 10, Chapter 12).
