CITRASENA I¦. A gandharva. There is reference to
this gandharva in many places in the purāṇas. He had
two wives Sandhyāvalī and Ratnāvalī.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%How Arjuna saved him.%} Once when Citrasena with
his wives was travelling in the aerial car the spittings of
Citrasena fell upon the sage Gālava who was doing his
sandhyā rites then. The sage complained about the
incident to Śrī Kṛṣṇa who promised to bring to him the
head of Citrasena before sun-set. Sage Nārada informed
Citrasena of this vow of Kṛṣṇa. The gandharva was
taken aback and did not know what to do. But Sandhyā-
valī and Ratnāvalī went and sought the help of Subhadrā.
They made a fire pit in front of her house and decided
to end their lives along with Citrasena by jumping into
the fire. While Citrasena was circling the fire-pit be-
fore jumping into it his wives wept loudly and hearing
the noise Subhadrā came out and saw what was happen-
ing. They then took from Subhadrā a boon to the effect
that they should be allowed to live with their husband.
It was only after granting them the boon that Subhadrā
understood the whole situation. Subhadrā was in a
fix but Arjuna assured her that Citrasena would be
protected at any cost. Arjuna very cleverly shielded all
the arrows sent against the gandharva by Kṛṣṇa and
gradually the fight came to be one between Arjuna and
Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Subhadrā came between them and it was
found difficult to continue the fight. Śrī Kṛṣṇa advised
Citrasena to bow down and touch the feet of Gālava.
Citrasena obeyed and the issue settled without harm to
both the parties.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Arjuna defeats Citrasena.%} While the Pāṇḍavas were
in exile, Duryodhana knew through a spy that they
were camping in the Dvaitavana forest. Prompted by
Karṇa Duryodhana programmed to go to Dvaitavana
with his retinue to enjoy the sight of the suffering Pāṇḍa-
vas. So they started to the forests under a pretext of an
annual stock-taking of the cows. They reached Dvaita-
vana with a huge army. There they split into parties
and roamed about making merry by themselves. Soon
one of the parties reached a pond near the hermitage of
the Pāṇḍavas. They saw a few gandharvas making
merry in the pond. With the usual haughtiness they
commanded the gandharvas to leave the pond and make
room for Duryodhana to come and bathe. The gandhar-
vas did not pay heed to their words and on being inform-
ed of this Duryodhana went to fight with the gandhar-
vas. It was Citrasena who led the gandharvas and by
his incessant shower of piercing arrows split the Kaurava
forces and made them flee for life. Duryodhana was
isolated from his army, was bound hand and foot and
taken a prisoner. In their sheer helplessness they approa-
ched Dharmaputra in his hermitage and acquainted
him with the pitiable plight of Duryodhana. Dharma-
putra asked Arjuna to go to the help of the Kauravas.
Arjuna faced Citrasena in a grim combat. Citrasena
then appeared in his real form and Arjuna knew that
he was fighting a friend. Then at the request of Arjuna
Citraratha released Duryodhana. (Chapters 239 to
243, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Other details.%} (1) This gandharva occupied a seat
in the court of Yudhiṣṭhira along with twentyseven other
[Page187-b+ 65]
gandharvas and a few Apsarā maidens. (Śloka 32,
Chapter 4, Sabhā Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Citrasena is a member of the court of Kubera also.
(Śloka 26, Chapter 10, Sabhā Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(3) Citrasena used to attend the court of Indra also
at times. (Śloka 22, Chapter 7, Sabhā Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(4) At the invitation of Indra Arjuna went to devaloka
and Citrasena taught him dance and music. It was
during this visit that Arjuna threw a cold blanket on the
amorous approaches of Urvaśī and was consequently
cursed by her to be an eunuch. It was through Citrasena
that Indra sent word to Urvaśī to console Arjuna and
give relief from the curse. (Chapters 45 and 46, Vana
Parva).
