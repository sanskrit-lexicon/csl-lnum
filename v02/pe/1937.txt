DHARMADATTA I¦. A king of Kosala. He had a wife
named Nāgaśrī. By her chastity she became a celebrity
and got the name of Arundhatī of the earth. They got
a daughter named Tārādattā. Once when Dharmadatta
and Nāgaśrī were engaged in conversation both remem-
[Page225-b+ 64]
bered their lives in their previous births. It was not
allowed to speak about previous births in open and if
anybody did so death was the penalty. But Nāgaśrī
could not control herself and prepared to accept the
worst. Nāgaśrī told her husband thus: “I am just remin-
ded of my life in my previous birth. I will tell you my
story. I was the servant maid of a brahmin named
Mādhava in this same place. I had a husband named
Devadāsa then. My husband was the son of a merchant.
We made a small house of our own and lived there
peacefully. Each of us would bring food from where we
worked and everyday we used to set apart a portion of
what we got for guests and the pitṛs. We were satisfied
with what was left after that. If we got more than one
set of clothes we would give it to the poor. Then there
came a famine in the country. Our earning also was
reduced daily. We lived in hunger. One day a hungry
and tired sannyāsī came to our place and we gave him
the whole of our food. My husband died that
day and I gave away my life jumping into the funeral
pyre of my husband. Then I was born in the family of
a King and became your wife.”
<div n="NI"/>Dharmadatta also got back the memory of his previous
birth. He said he was the Devadāsa of Nāgaśrī's
previous life.
<div n="NI"/>The moment they finished talking about their previous
births both fell down dead. Orphaned Tārādattā then
lived under the care of her mother's younger sister.
After some time a Maharṣi came to their house and by
his blessing Tārādattā got a husband named Kaliṅga-
sena. Kaliṅgasena was a brave and daring Prince. Very
soon they got a daughter and she was named Kaliṅga-
senā. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Madanamañjukā laṃbaka,
Taraṅga 2).
