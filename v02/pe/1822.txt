<div n="NI"/>Devāpa had seven daughters, viz. Śrutadevā, Śāntidevā,
Upadevā, Śrīdevā, Devarakṣitā, Sahadevā and Devakī.
Devakī was married to Vasudeva. The statement that
Devakī and Kaṃsa were sister and brother is not fully
correct. Kaṃsa was the son of Ugrasena, the brother of
Devaka. Devakī was the grand-daughter of Devaka.
Certain Purāṇas refer to Devakī as the daughter of
Devaka. According to them Kaṃsa and Devakī were
children of the elder and the younger brothers respecti-
vely. According to the Agni Purāṇa Devakī was the
niece of Kaṃsa. Thus it is equally correct to say that
between Kaṃsa and Devakī there was brother-sister
relationship as also uncle-niece relationship.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Devakī in previous birth.%} Devakī in her previous birth
was Aditi, the daughter of Dakṣa and wife of Kaśyapa-
prajāpati. (See Aditi, Parva 3).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Marriage and children.%} Vasudeva, the Yādava married
Devakī. Śrī Kṛṣṇa was their eighth child. Six sons of
theirs born elder to Kṛṣṇa were killed by Kaṃsa. (See
Kaṃsa, Para 2). The seventh child, from the very
womb itself of Devakī was passed on to the womb of
Rohiṇī, who was another wife of Vasudeva. Balabhadra
was the child thus born to Rohiṇī. The eighth child
was Kṛṣṇa. (For details see Kṛṣṇa, Para 3-8).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other information relating to Devakī.%} (1) Many Kṣat-
riya kings attended the svayaṃvara of Devakī. (Droṇa
Parva, Chapter 144, Verse 9).
<div n="NI"/>(2) Following Kṛṣṇa's giving up of his body and the
destruction, due to mutual fights, of the Yādavas, Vasu-
deva, Rohiṇī and Devakī also gave up their lives.
