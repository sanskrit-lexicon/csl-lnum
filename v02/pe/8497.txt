VIṢṆUDĀSA¦. A Vaiṣṇavite devotee who lived in ancient
days. The story of this devotee who defeated his king
Cola in devotion to Viṣṇu, is given in Padma Purāṇa,
Uttara Khaṇḍa, Chapter 110. The story is as follows.
<div n="NI"/>In days of old there was a king named Cola in Kāñcī-
pura. It was because of his reign that the country got
the name Cola. He had performed several sacrifices.
On the banks of the river Tāmraparṇī, stood his golden
Yūpas (pegs on which sacrificial animals were tied)
that the place looked like Caitraratha.
<div n="NI"/>Once the king went to the temple and worshipped
Viṣṇu by offering flowers of gold and jewels such as
chalcedony and prostrated before Viṣṇu and rose up.
At that time a Brahmin named Viṣṇudāsa from his own
city came there to worship, with holy basil and water
as offerings. He worshipped with the leaves and flower-
bunches of holy basil. Because of his worship by holy
basil, the king's worship by jewels, was dimmed. The
emperor got angry and said, “Viṣṇudāsa, you are a poor
man who does not know how to worship Viṣṇu. What
merit has your worship of holy basil after mine of
jewels?” Both began to contest on this point. At last the
king said “Let us see who between us will get oneness
with Viṣṇu first, you or I”
<div n="NI"/>After saying this the king went to his palace. He appoint-
ed Mudgala the high priest and began to perform a
sacrifice to Viṣṇu. The sacrifice was going on with
pomp and festivities. Viṣṇudāsa also was immersed in
devotion to Viṣṇu to the best of his abilities.
<div n="NI"/>Once Visṇudāsa, after his usual prayer and meditation
prepared rice-food. But somebody took away the cook-
ed rice unseen by Viṣṇudāsa. Fearing that he would
miss the time for his evening prayer, he did not think
of cooking food again. Next day also he cooked food
and went for evening prayer. On that day also the rice
was stolen. This continued. One day after cooking the
food, Viṣṇudāsa waited close by in a hidden corner. He
saw a low-caste man who was a mere skeleton because of
[Page867-b+ 65]
famine, stealing the cooked rice and feeling pity on him
he said, “Stop, stop. How can you eat it without any oily
thing? See, take this ghee also.” Saying so he drew
near. The out-caste was terrified at this and ran away.
On the way he stumbled and fell. Viṣṇudāsa ran to
the spot and fanned him with his cloth. When he rose
up the figure in the place of the low-caste was that of
the real Śrī Nārāyaṇa with conch, discus and club held
in his hands. Because of devotion Viṣṇudāsa stood be-
numbed. While the King Cola and the people were look-
ing on, Viṣṇudāsa got into the divine Vimāna and went
to the world of Viṣṇu.
