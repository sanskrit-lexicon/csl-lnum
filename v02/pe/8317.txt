VIJAYA¦ XIII. The divine bow of Karṇa. It is said that
this bow was the most divine of all weapons. This bow
which was made by Viśvakarmā, originally belonged
to Indra. At that time Indra had defeated many asuras
with the help of this bow. Indra gave this bow to his
loved disciple Paraśurāma. Karṇa got it from Paraśu-
rāma. It is said that this bow was superior to Gāṇḍīva.
It was with the help of this bow that Paraśurāma con-
quered the Kṣatriyas twentyone times. (M.B. Karṇa
Parva, Chapter 31, Stanza 42).
