MITHU¦. A very valorous dānava. Once Bharata son of
Ārṣṭiṣeṇa was making preparations for an Aśvamedha
on the banks of the river Sarasvatī with Upamanyu as
his priest when Mithu came and took them both to
Pātāla. Then Devāpi, son of Upamanyu, got his father
and the King released from there by continuous worship
of Śiva (Brahma Purāṇa—127. 56-57).
