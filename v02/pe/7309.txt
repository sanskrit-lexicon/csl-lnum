SŪTA¦ I
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} A hermit who recounted the
Purāṇas to other hermits at Naimiṣa forest. He was a
disciple of Vyāsa. Vyāsa composed the Purāṇas and
taught them to his son, hermit Śuka who was a man of
abstinence and who was not born of womb. At this time
Vyāsa had another disciple named Sūta. It is stated in
Devī Bhāgavata, Skandha 9, that this Sūta who was a
fellow disciple of Śuka, who had learned all the Purāṇas
directly from the teacher Vyāsa, and who was capable
saying stories so convincingly, was the son of the her-
mit Lomaharṣa.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%In Naimiṣāraṇya.%} Sūta who had learned the Purāṇas
directly form Vyāsa, happened to reach Naimiṣāraṇya
once. (See under Naimiṣāraṇya). Naimiṣāraṇya is
the abode of hermits in the Kali-age. In days of old,
hermits, who were miserable because of the evils of Kali-
yuga, which was fast approaching, gathered here at the
end of Dvāparayuga. They went to the world of Brahmā
to consult about the means and ways of preventing the
[Page774-b+ 65]
evils of Kaliyuga. Having heard their complaints Brahmā
brought a wheel of the figure of mind and placing it be-
fore the hermits told them thus: “You follow this wheel.
The place where this wheel falls down will be a place of
purity, which will not be affected by the evils of Kali-
age. There you can live in peace, without being affected
by the evils of Kali-age till the coming of the Satya-
yuga.” Saying these words Brahmā set the wheel rolling
in front of them. The hermits followed it. The wheel
rolled on till it reached the earth, fell down and was
crumbled to powder in a particular place. That place
became famous later under the name Naimiṣāraṇya.
Sūta came to this place.
<div n="NI"/>As soon as they saw Sūta, the hermits such as Śaunaka
and others who were living there welcomed Sūta with
hospitality and told him thus: “Oh! hermit, you are
the disciple of Vyāsa. You have learned the eighteen
Purāṇas from Vyāsa We are eager to hear them. So
please recite to us the Purāṇas, the hearing of which
will remit all sins and secure heaven.”
<div n="NI"/>According to this request Sūta recited the eighteen
Purāṇasto the gathering of the hermits. It is in the form
of the teaching of Sūta to Śaunaka and the others, i.e.
in the form of a dialogue between Sūta and Śaunaka,
that the people got the Purāṇas. (Devī Bhāgavata,
Skandha I).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Sūta was beheaded.%} In Bhāgavata, Skandha 10, there
occurs a story, stating how Balabhadrarāma cut off the
head of Sūta as the battle of Kurukṣetra had started
when Sūta had been reciting the eighteen Purāṇas in
Naimiṣāraṇya and how his head was fixed in its place
again and he was brought to life. (For further details see
under Balabhadrarāma, Para 6).
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Other details.%} Sūta was one of the hermits who visited
Bhīṣma on his bed of arrows during the battle of
Bhārata. (M.B. Śānti Parva, Chapter 47 Verse 12).
