<div n="NI"/>2) {%Origin.%} There is a story about the origin of these
seven islands and the surrounding seas, in Devī Bhāga-
vata Skandha 8.
<div n="NI"/>Two famous sons named Priyavrata and Uttānapāda
were born to Svāyambhuva Manu. Priyavrata and his
children ruled the country for a period of eleven arbu-
das, that is a hundred million years. Though he was
aged so much the power of his mind and body did
[Page691-a+ 64]
not show any sign of weakness. At this time he saw once
the sun travelling on the first side of the earth, and
began to think. “When the sun is walking on one
side of the earth, the other side must naturally be dark.
Will it happen so in our time? In all places at all
times it should be bright and there should be no dark-
ness.” Thinking thus he got into a chariot as bright as
the sun and travelled round the earth seven times.
During these travels the wheels of the chariot made
seven furrows on the earth. These furrows became the
seven seas and the beds between the furrows became
seven islands.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Sovereign powers.%} Priyavrata made his seven sons
sovereigns of the seven islands. These seven sovereign
rulers were Agnīdhra, Idhmajihva, Yajñabāhu,
Hiraṇyaretas, Ghṛtapṛṣṭha, Medhātithi and Vītihotra.
