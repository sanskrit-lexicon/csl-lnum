CITRĀṄGADĀ III¦. Daughter of Viśvakarmā. Once
while she was bathing in a pond along with her compa-
nions in the forest of Naimiśa Prince Suratha, son of
Sudeva, came that way. Seeing him Citrāṅgadā told her
companions “This beautiful young man is in love. I
must give myself to him”. Though her companions
objected to her doing this, waving aside the objections
Citrāṅgadā approached Suratha.
<div n="NI"/>When Viśvakarmā knew about this he was extremely
angry and cursed her saying that she would never have
a marriage. Citrāṅgadā fainted when she heard the
curse and her companions tried their best to wake her
up, but failed. They then took her to be dead and left
the place in search of firewood and other things to
conduct a funeral.
<div n="NI"/>When Citrāṅgadā woke up she looked around for her
companions and finding none including her lover, the
prince, she ran and threw herself into the river, Sarasvatī.
[Page186-a+ 64]
That river pushed her down to river Gomatī and that
river in turn washed her ashore a huge forest. There
she was met by the sage Ṛtadhvaja. Knowing her
sad tale the sage felt compassion for her and cursed
Viśvakarmā to be born as a monkey. Then he let her
marry her lover and blessed them. (Chapters 63 and
64, Vāmana Purāṇa).
