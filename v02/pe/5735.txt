REVANTA¦. A son of the sun.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} The sun married the daughter of Viśvakarmā
named Saṃjñā. She gave birth to three children named
Manu, Yama and Yamī. Once, being unable to bear
the radiance of her husband, Saṃjñā went to the forest
to do penance. During this period Chāyā the maid of
Saṃjñā attended on the sun. Three children, Śanaiścara,
Manu and Tapatī were born to the Sun of Chāyā.
Once Chāyā cursed Yama. Then only did the Sun
remember about Saṃjñā. At that time Saṃjñā had been
doing penance in the forest in the form of a mare. The
Sun took the form of a horse and lived with her in the
forest. From this union Aśvinīkumāras and also the last
son Revanta were born. (Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Aṃśa 3, Chapter
2).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Lakṣmī astounded at the sight of Revanta.%} For the story
of how Lakṣmī was astounded at the sight of Revanta's
handsome figure and how Mahāviṣṇu cursed Lakṣmī
consequently, see under Ekavīra.
