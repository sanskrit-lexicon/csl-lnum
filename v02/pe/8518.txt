VIŚRAVAS¦. Father of Rāvaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General Information.%} Viśravas was the son born to
Pulastya the son of Brahmā, by his wife Havirbhuk.
The son Vaiśravaṇa was born to him by his wife
[Page869-a+ 65]
Ilabilā (Iḍabiḍā) and Rāvaṇa and his brothers by his
wife Kaikasī. In Mahābhārata, Vana Parva, Chapter
274, there is a story about the birth of Vaiśravaṇa
(Kubera) as son to Viśravas.
<div n="NI"/>The son Vaiśravaṇa was born to Pulastya. Vaiśravaṇa
rejected his father Pulastya and served his grandfather
Brahmā. Pulastya did not like this. He generated an-
other son Viśravas from half of his body. Viśravas
tried to wreak vengeance on Vaiśravaṇa, who took
refuge near Brahmā, who was much pleased at Vaiśra-
vaṇa and granted him immortality, the state of being
the owner of wealth, the position of ‘Lokapāla’, connec-
tion with Śiva, a son named Nalakūbara, the city of
Laṅkā, the Puṣpaka Vimāna, the lordship of the
Yakṣas and the title Rājarāja (King of Kings).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Family Life.%} Kubera engaged three beautiful Rākṣasa
damsels, Puṣpotkaṭā, Rākā and Mālinī to attend on
Viśravas. Puṣpotkaṭā had the name Kaikasī also.
Kaikasī gave birth to Rāvaṇa and Kumbhakarṇa.
Khara and Śūrpaṇakhā were born to Rākā and Mālinī
gave birth to Vibhīṣaṇa. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter
275, Verse 7).
