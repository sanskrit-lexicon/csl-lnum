KĪRTI I¦. Daughter of Śuka Brahmarṣi, son of Vyāsa.
Śuka wedded Pīvarī, the beautiful daughter of the
Pitṛs. Four sons named Kṛṣṇa, Gauraprabha, Bhūri
and Devaśruta and a daughter Kīrti were born to
Śuka and Pīvarī. Kīrti was wedded by Prince Aṇu,
son of King Vibhrama, and a son called Brahmadatta
was born to them, who grew up to become a great
scholar and an ascetic. On the advice of Nārada,
King Brahmadatta ultimately abdicated the throne in
favour of his son, performed penance at Badaryāśrama
and attained salvation. (Devī Bhāgavata, 1st Skandha).
