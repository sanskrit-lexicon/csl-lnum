IDHMAVĀHA¦. Son of Agastya and his wife Lopāmudrā.
The actual name of Idhmavāha was Tridasyu. There is
a story in the Mahābhārata about the birth of this boy.
When Lopāmudrā was pregnant, Agastya asked her:—
“1000 sons of average ability; or 100 sons, each of them
having the worth of 10 sons; or 10 sons, each having the
worth of 100 sons; or a single son having the nobility
and greatness of more than a thousand sons; which
would you prefer?” Lopāmudrā chose a single son with
the greatness of a thousand sons. Tridasyu or Idhmavāha
was the son born according to her wish. The child was
in the womb for seven years before he was born. He
began to recite Vedas even from the moment of his
birth. As the boy grew up, he used to bring small pieces
of firewoods and twigs to feed the fire for his father's
homa. That was why he got the name Idhmavāha.
(One who brings the necessary things for homa).
(Idhma=fuel; vāha=one who carries).
