ŚAMBARA I¦. An asura.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%General.%} Various Purāṇas refer to this leader of the
asuras as having played a prominent part in the dev-
āsura war. After many such wars he was killed by
Śiva.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Śambara's magic power.%} He possessed marvellous
magic powers. Once while fighting with him, the
Devas were non-plussed by his magical powers, and
they hid themselves in a forest. Śambara was pleased
and he roamed about freely without any fear and
burnt the palaces of the protectors of the world. The
Devas left their homes and disappeared in disguise.
The Devas began killing those whom Śambara had
appointed as army-chieftains. To counter this attack
by the Devas, he created three powerful asuras by his
powers of magic. The three asuras called Dama,
Vyāla and Ghaṭa began killing the warriors of the
Devas, and the Devas told Brahmā at Satyaloka about
the depredations of the asura. Brahmā encouraged
them for further fighting, and the three asuras were
killed and Śambara ran away and hid himself.
(Jñānavāsiṣṭha Sthitiprakaraṇam).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Śambara in Ṛgveda.%} There are various references

Dasyus. He had mastery over hundred cities. The forts
and trenches in those cities were very strong. The
