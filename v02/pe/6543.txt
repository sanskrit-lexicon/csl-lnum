SAVYA¦. A son of Aṅgiras, Savya is actually Indra him-
self. The story is that Aṅgiras began worshipping the
Devatās for a son equal to Indra and that Indra, think-
ing that there should not be another person equal to
him, got himself born as the son of Aṅgiras. That son
is Savya. (Ṛgveda, Maṇḍala 1, Anuvāka 10, Sūkta 51).
