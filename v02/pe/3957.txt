LAKṢMĪDĀSA¦. A Sanskrit poet who was the author
of Śukasandeśa.
<div n="NI"/>1). {%Birth.%} He was born in the former state of Cochin in
Kariṅgāmpilly Mana. This Mana (house) was near the
temple of Tṛppūtamaṅgala in Vellārappilly in Cochin
(Kaṇayannūr taluk). The Kariṅgāmpilly Mana was
bearing the position of Taliyātiri in the village of Irāṇik-
kula. It is over two hundred years since that Mana
became extinct. (The houses of Namboothiri brahmins
are called Manas).
<div n="NI"/>2) It is believed that the famous ‘Śukasandeśa’ was
written in 112 M.E. There is one set of historians
who hold that it was written in 666 A.D. But the fam-
ous scholar and poet Ullūr states with authority that
it was written in the 10th or 11th century A.D.
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Stories about this poet.%} As usual there are legends
regarding this poet also. That the poet was a very
dull boy in his childhood and that he became bright
and brilliant by the blessings of his guru is one legend.
After writing his Śukasandeśa the poet went on a
pilgrimage in South India. One night he came to a
brahmin's house but was not given any food or a place
to sleep. He slept in an open veranda on the outside.
He was lying awake when he heard his ‘Śukasandeśa’
being read inside by a few people. At a stage they were
not able to follow the import of a verse when Lakṣmī-
dāsa shouted the meaning from outside. A door
opened and a voice enquired in Tamil “Are you
Kariṅgāmpilly?” When he said yes they were extremely
happy and took him inside and treated him with
respect.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Works.%} No major work other then Śukasandeśa has
been found. Two small poems are available.
<div n="NI"/>Śukasandeśa has been written on the model of the
famous Meghasandeśa of Kālidāsa. Many commentaries
on this have come to light; of these the one written by
[Page450-b+ 64]
Mānavedan Rāja of Kozhikode Palace named Vilāsinī
is the best. Other commentaries named Varavarṇinī,
Cintātilaka and Vyākṛti are also worth mentioning.
