CITRALEKHĀ II¦. A companion of Uṣā, daughter of
the demon, Bāṇa. She was a beautiful portrait painter.
Uṣā once dreamt of Aniruddha, grandson of Kṛṣṇa.
Even before knowing the identity of the idol of her dream
Uṣā fell in love with him. Next day morning Citra-
lekhā gathered from the gloomy Uṣā details of her dream
and Citralekhā started making portraits of many known
charming princes but Uṣā was not satisfied. She then
drew in her imagination a figure which was exactly like
that of Aniruddha, the man of her dream. Uṣā was
satisfied and it was through the cleverness of Chitralekhā
that Aniruddha was brought to Uṣā's room and
Uṣā was able to marry Aniruddha. (See under ‘Ani-
ruddha’).
