MITRĀVARUṆA¦(S). The combined name of two of
the Dvādaśādityas (twelve Sūryas) Mitra and Varuṇa.
These two are always seen together. Agastya and
Vasiṣṭha were born as sons of Mitrāvaruṇa. It was due
to a curse by Mitrāvaruṇas that Urvaśī had to marry
King Purūravas, a man of the earth. Manu had no
children and he performed a yāga to placate Mitrā-
varuṇas. But since there were many faults in the
ceremony a girl was born to him. (For details see under
Ilā, Nimi, Urvaśī, Vasiṣṭha and Mitra).
