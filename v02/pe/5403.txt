PRAYĀGA¦. A sacred place situated at the meeting point
of Gaṅgā and Yamunā. He who bathes at this holy
spot would get the benefit of doing ten aśvamedhas.
(Śloka 35, Chapter 84, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>It is believed that at Prayāga there is the presence of
Brahmā, devatās, dikpālakas (guardians of the quarters),
lokapālakas (guardians of the world), Sādhyas (realised
souls), Pitṛs (manes), Maharṣis like Sanatkumāra, Aṅgiras,
Brahmarṣis, Nāgas, Garuḍa, Siddhas, Sūryadeva and

Mahāviṣṇu. There are three fire-pits there. The river
Gaṅgā runs through the centre of these pits. The
Centre of the confluence of Gaṅgā and Yamunā is be-
lieved to be the waist of the world. There is at Prayāga
the world-famous Triveṇī confluence. If one bathes at
that place one gets the benefit of Aśvamedha and Rāja-
sūya together.
<div n="NI"/>The greatness of Prayāga is described thus: Prayāga-
tīrtha, Pratiṣṭhānatīrtha, Kambalatīrtha, Aśvataratīrtha,
and Bhogavatītīrtha are said to be the Yāgavedīs of
Prajāpati. At such a Prayāga Vedas and Yajñas live
personified. If one praises it or chants its name in
songs or smears the mud from it on one's body, one
would be absolved of all sins. If one gives away any-
thing in charity at this place or conducts Śrāddha
(ceremony of giving offerings to deceased relatives) or
does pious mutterings one would get benefits of an
imperishable nature. There are about seventy thousand
tīrthas in this world, ten thousand of one kind and sixty
thousand of another kind. Prayāga has the presence of
all these tīrthas and so it is considered as the best of all
tīrthas. Here is the Bhogavatītīrtha of Vāsuki and the tīrtha
called Haṃsaprapatana. If one bathes in the ponds
there for three days together one would get the credit
of giving as charity a crore of cows. The three impor-
tant places are the Gaṅgādvāra, Prayāga and Gaṅgā-
sāgarasaṅgama. Chapter 211, Agni Purāṇa).
