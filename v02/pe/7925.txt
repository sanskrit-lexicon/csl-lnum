VAJRA II¦. The son of Aniruddha, who was the
grandson of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Mention is made in Mahā-
bhārata, Mausala Parva, Chapter 7, Stanza 72, that
after the extermination of the Yādavas by the mausala
fight (the fight with grass grown from the filings of the
iron-pestle), Arjuna anointed Vajra as the King of the
remaining Yādavas. When the Pāṇḍavas began the
Mahāprasthāna (the great departure), Yudhiṣṭhira
called Subhadrā and instructed her to look after Vajra
with particular care. (M.B. Mahā Prasthāna Parva,
Chapter 1, Stanza 8).
