KUMĀRĪPŪJĀ¦. It is a special item in Navarātripūjā.
According to the definition ‘Kumārikā tu sā proktā
dvivarṣā yā bhavediha,’ Kumārī is a two-year old
female child. To worship such a child is Kumarīpūjā,
and it should be conducted accompanied by sumptuous
feasts and presentation of clothes etc. There are no
hard and fast rules as to how many Kumārīs should
be worshipped and as to the manner and method of
the worship. The same Kumārī may be worshipped
during all the days of the Pūjā, or every day one more
girl may be worshipped like this:—one girl on the first
day, two on the second day and so on. Or it may be
in the order 4, 6, 8 etc or 4, 8, 12, 16 etc. Even if
the daily number be nine it is in order. There is no
rule that Kumārīs alone should be worshipped; any one
of the navakanyakās would do. A girl two years
old is called Kumārī, three years old Trimūrti; four
years old Kalyāṇī; five years old Rohiṇī; six years old
Kālī; Seven years old Caṇḍikā; eight years old Śāmb-
havī; nine years old Durgā and ten years old Subhadrā.
These girls are called Navakanyakās. But, a child less
than two years of age should not be worshipped, because
it will not be fully sensitive to taste, smell etc. Also,
age alone does not render Kumārīs suitable for worship.
They should be absolutely free from ulcers, leprosy,
ugliness, squint-eyes, dwarfishness, lameness, bad
odour, stigma of low birth etc. For the achievement of
special objects a Brahmin child should be worshipped;
for victory, a Kṣatriya child and for profit, a Vaiśya
or a Sūdra child should be worshipped. The Brahmin
may worship brahmin childern; the Kṣatriya, Brahmin
and Kṣatriya children; the Vaiśya, Brahmin, Kṣatriya
and Vaiśya children; and the Śūdra, Brahmin,
Kṣatriya, Vaiśya and Śūdra children. (Devī Bhāga-
vata, 3rd Skandha).
