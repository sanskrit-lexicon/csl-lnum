CANDRAŚARMĀ I¦. A great sinner, who killed his
preceptor. The Padma Purāṇa relates the story of four
sinners named Vidura, Candraśarman, Vedaśarman
and Vañjula, who shed their sin by bathing in the
Gaṅgā. The sins committed by the four were respectively
Brahmahatyā (killing of brahmin), Guruhatyā (killing
of the preceptor), Agamyāgamana (having sexual con-
tact with women like the wife of guru which is debarred)
and Govadha (killing of cow) respectively. The leader
of the above four sinners was one Vidura of the Pāñcāla
deśa. He was begging in the streets without the tuft
of hair, the sacred thread and tilaka (mark of sandal
paste etc. on the forehead). He went from house to
house begging for alms crying thus: “Here is come the
man (himself) who committed Brahmahatyā. Please
[Page174-b+ 65]
give alms to the brahmin-killer who is a drunkard also.”
During his begging tour he visited all the tīrthas also,
yet brahmahatyā stuck on to him.
<div n="NI"/>While this sinner Vidura, his heart rent with sorrow and
remorse, was sitting under a tree, a Māgadha brahmin
called Candraśarman happened to come there. This
brahmin had committed the sin of guruhatyā (killing the
preceptor). He told Vidura:—“While residing with the
guru, blinded by desire, I killed the guru, and am now
burning myself in the fire of repentance.”
<div n="NI"/>While they were engaged thus in conversation a third
person, called Vedaśarman also came there in an absolu-
tely tired condition. He told Vidura and Candraśarman
that his relatives and others had cast him out as he once
did the sin of agamyāgamana, and by the time he had
finished telling his story a Vaiśya called Vañjula came
there. Besides drinking liquor he had committed govadha
(killing of cow) also. Though these four sinners assemb-
led at the same place, they only talked, but did not touch
one another, take food together, rest on the same seat
or lie on the same bedsheet.
<div n="NI"/>According to the advice of a Siddha (an evolved soul)
the four sinners dived in the holy waters of Gaṅgā and
came out redeemed of their sins. (Padma Purāṇa,
Chapter 91).
