NAPUṂSAKA¦. (EUNUCH). Mention is made in
Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Chapter 48, that the semen intro-
duced into the womb of the woman by the man at
the time of coition, will get mixed with the blood in
the womb, and that the issue will be male, female or
eunuch according to the proportion of the mixture. In
the mixture of semen and blood, if blood exceeds semen
the issue will be female and if semen exceeds, it will be
male child and if both are equal the child will be a
eunuch.
