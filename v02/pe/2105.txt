DRAVIḌA¦(M). (DRĀVIḌA). In ancient days the
whole of South India was known by the name Tami-
laka, as Tamil was the language used throughout South
India. Strictly speaking, all the languages used in
South India were given the name Tamil. The word
‘Tamil’ underwent changes in the language of North
India and took the form ‘Drāvida’. Etymologists are
of opinion that the changes that took place in the word
Tamil were are follows:- Tamil—Damil—Damiḍ-
-Dramiḍ—Draviḍ—Drāviḍ. Reference to the
Drāviḍa country occurs in most of the Purāṇas.
Mahābhārata states that Sahadeva, one of the Pāṇḍa-
vas, sent a note for collecting taxes from the people of
Drāvida. Sabhā Parva, Chapter 31, Stanza 71.
<div n="NI"/>“There are other countries also in the southern Bhārata
such as Dravida, Kerala, Prācya, Mūṣīka, Vanavāsīka
Karṇāṭaka, Mahiṣaka, Vikalpa and Mūṣaka.” This
statement (M.B. Bhīṣma Parva, Chapter 9) throws
light on the various countries which existed in South
India at the time of Mahābhārata. In Bhāgavata,
Skandha 10, it is mentioned that Kaṃsa, the uncle of
Śrī Kṛṣṇa, was the son of Dramila, a gandharva. (See
under Kaṃsa).
