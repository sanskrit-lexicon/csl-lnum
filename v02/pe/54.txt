AGNI¦.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Genealogy.%} Agni was descended from Viṣṇu in this
order: Viṣṇu-Brahmā-Aṅgiras-Bṛhaspati-Agni.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Birth.%} We come across several contradictory state-
ments in the Purāṇas regarding the birth of Agni. There
is some real difficulty, therefore, in tracing correctly
the true genealogy of Agni. The one given above is
based on statements in Bhāgavata and Mahābhārata.
Aṅgiras is one of the six mind-born sons of Brahmā.
<F>*) Manas=Mind. Putra=Son. Mānasa-putras are sons created from the mind of Brahmā, Śloka 10, Chapter 65, Ādi Parva, M.B.</F>
Aṅgiras married Śraddhā and got four daughters and
two sons. Bṛhaspati was one of the sons and Utatthya
was the other. The daughters were Sinīvālī, Kuhū,
Rākā and Anumati. (There is a mention of a third
son named Saṃvarta in the Bhāgavata by Eluthassan
though the original quoted below does not say so)
<Poem>Śraddhā tu aṅgirasaḥ patnī

Bṛhaspati married Cāndramasī and got six divine sons.
<div n="NI"/>Of these Saṃyu, the eldest, married Satyā and Agni
was born to Saṃyu of Satyā. (Ślokas 1 to 4, Chapter
219, Āraṇya Kāṇḍa of Malayālam Mahābhārata).
<div n="NI"/>3) {%Agni—One of the Aṣṭa-dik-pālakas.%} (Aṣṭa=eight,
dik=zone, pālaka=guardian). The Devī Bhāgavata
states in its eighth chapter that Agni is one of the eight
guards posted at the eight different zones to protect
the universe. Indra guards the east; Agni, the south-
east; Yama the south; Nirṛti, the south-west; Varuṇa,
the west; Vāyu, the north-west; Kubera, the North and
Śiva, the north-east. The place where Agni sits on
guard is known as tejovatī.
<div n="NI"/>4) {%Agni—One of the five elements.%} The universe is be-
lieved to be composed of five elements of which Agni
is one. The other four are Water, Earth, Ether and
Air.
<div n="NI"/>5) {%The story of how Agni gave a Māyā Sītā (Phantom%}
{%Sītā) to Śrī Rāma.%} During their exile in the forests
Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were for some time living in an
āśrama built on the shores of the ocean. One day
Agni disguised as a Brāhmin approached them and
said “O, Śrī Rāma, thou art born to kill the demon
Rāvaṇa and save the world from his atrocities. Sītā is
going to be a cause for that. Time is not far for you
to finish this duty of yours. Rāvaṇa is soon to come and
kidnap your wife, Sītā. You must, therefore, allow me
to play a trick on Rāvaṇa. Entrust Sītā with me and
I shall keep her safe. In her place here you can keep
a Māyā Sītā. (Phantom Sītā) which will be a live rep-
lica of your real wife. In the end when you take back
Sītā after killing Rāvaṇa you will be compelled to
throw your wife into the fire to test her chastity. At
[Page011-a+ 65]
that time I will take back the replica and give you
back your real wife”. Śrī Rāma was very much
pleased to hear this. Agni then, by his yogic powers
created a Phantom Sītā and gave her to him. Rāma
kept this as a secret even from Lakṣmaṇa. In the great
Rāma-Rāvaṇa battle Rāvaṇa was killed and Śrī Rāma
took back Sītā to his kingdom. Then respecting public
opinion and wishing to establish in public the purity
of his queen King Śrī Rāma put her into the fire. At
that moment Agni took back the replica and gave
back the real Sītā to Śrī Rāma. Sītā thus came out
from the fire unscathed. Later, on the advice of Rāma
and Agni, the Phantom Sītā went to the sacred place
Puṣkara and started doing tapas (penance) there.
After doing tapas for a long period of three lakhs of
divine years this Phantom Sītā became known as
Svargalakṣmī. It was this Svargalakṣmī that later on
in the Dvāpara yuga came out from the yajña kuṇḍa
of King Pāñcāla as Pāñcālī and became the consort of
the Pāṇḍavas. Vedavatī, daughter of Kuśadhvaja in
Kṛtayuga, Sītā, daughter of Janaka in the Treta yuga,
and Pāñcālī, daughter of Drupada in Dvāpara yuga
are one and the same person. On account of this she
is known as trihāyanī also. (Chapter 9 of Devī
Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>6) {%The story of how Agni got indigestion.%} In olden times
there was a bold and mighty King called Śvetaki. He
conducted several different types of yajña. Afflicted
by the unending dense smoke in the yajña hall all the
ascetics left the place and went their way. Undaunted
by this, Śvetaki started another twelve-year sacrifice in
which not a single sage took part. The sages rebuked
him and said if he wanted to conduct a sacrifice again
he could invite śūdras to help him. (Śūdras belong
to the lowest caste among Hindus and are not allow-
ed to participate in sacrifices generally.) Enraged
by this insult Śvetaki went to Kailāsa and did fierce
penance. Lord Śiva appeared before him and gave him
Durvāsas as a priest for his yajña. For twelve years
sage Durvāsas performed the yajña pouring into
the mouth of Agni through the sacrificial pit un-
limited materials of food. Agni was overfed and
he got indigestion. He lost all appetite for food, be-
came weak and the brilliance of his face faded.
(Chapter 235, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>7) {%The story of how Agni burnt the big forest, Khāṇḍava.%}
When the indigestion continued without abate for some
time Agni approached Brahmā and asked for a cure.
Brahmā declared that his indigestion would be cured
if Agni could burn the huge forest, Khāṇḍava, the
abode of the enemies of the Devas. Agni immediately
started consuming the forest. But the inhabitants of the
forest soon quenched the fire. Disappointed Agni went
to Brahmā again and the latter advised him to wait for
some time till the advent of Nara-Nārāyaṇas to that
forest. They would then help Agni to burn the forest.
Agni waited for the time to come. At that time the
Pāṇḍavas were living in Indraprastha with Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
When the heat became unbearable there Arjuna and
Kṛṣṇa came to the banks of river Yamunā. Hearing
about the arrival of Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna who were none
but the incarnations of Nārāyaṇa and Nara, Agni dis-
guised as a brahmin approached them and requested
them to help him to burn the Khāṇḍava forest. Agni
added that any attempt of his to burn the forest was
[Page011-b+ 65]
always foiled by Indra who would send a heavy down-
pour of rain to quench the fire because Takṣaka, an
intimate friend of Indra, was living there.
<div n="NI"/>To gain his end Agni gave Arjuna an arrow-case
which would never be empty, a chariot bearing a
monkey flag, four white horses adorned with gold
chains and also the famous Gāṇḍīva bow. To Śrī Kṛṣṇa
he gave the cakrāyudha or the divine wheel-weapon.
(All these military equipments were once given to
Agni by Varuṇa.) When all these were given to them
Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna got ready to help Agni to burn the
forest. Agni started burning the forest, Indra at once
sent a heavy downpour of rain and Arjuna created a
canopy of arrows above the forest preventing the rains
from falling on the forest. Agni carried on his work
undisturbed, the forest was burnt and Agni was cured
of his indigestion. (Ślokas 233 to 239, Ādi Parva,
M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>8) {%Agni falls in love.%} As an inaugural procedure to the
great Rājasūya which Dharmaputra performed at
Indraprastha his four brothers Bhīma, Arjuna, Nakula
and Sahadeva conducted a victory march to the four
different sides of the kingdom. Sahadeva who turned
south conquered many kings including Dantavaktra
and Bhīṣmaka and reached a country called Māhiṣmatī-
pura. There he had to encounter a powerful king
called Nīla. Before long there broke a fire in his camp.
Disheartened, Sahadeva prayed to the God, Agni, for
help. It was then that Sahadeva came to know about
the ties between Agni and Nīla.
<div n="NI"/>King Nīla had a beautiful daughter named Sudarśanā.
Once when she was talking to her father after having
entered the Agni-hotra Agni fell in love with her. From
that day onwards Agni became dreamy about the
beautiful lips of Sudarśanā. It reached a stage when
Agni would burn only if it was blown by the lips of
Sudarśanā. This ended in Agni marrying Sudarśanā.
After the marriage Agni lived in the palace of his
father-in-law, King Nīla, as a useful ally. It was at this
time that Sahadeva came to conquer Nīla. But Agni
knew that for the proper conduct of the Rājasūya of
Dharmaputra his father-in-law had to surrender to
Sahadeva and so advised his father-in-law to do so.
What appeared to be a difficult problem was thus
easily solved. (Chapter 31, Sabhā Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>9) {%How Emperor Śibi was tested by Agni.%} Once Agni and
Indra thought of testing how strong and deep was the
sense of charity in Emperor Śibi. Indra took the shape
of a hawk and Agni that of a dove and the dove flew
and dropped down into the lap of the Emperor who
was at that time doing a yāga. The hungry hawk
came chasing its prey and finding the dove in the lap
of the Emperor said: “O King, is it proper on your
part to withhold my food from me, and keep it in your
lap?” Hearing this Śibi replied: “This dove has sought
refuge in me. It is my duty to give it protection. If it
is only food you want I shall give you food.” Śibi then
offered many things including his kingdom to the
hawk in return for the dove. But the hawk refused
them all and finally agreed to accept an equal weight
of flesh from the body of the Emperor. Śibi without
any hesitation cut a portion of his thigh and weighed
it against the dove in a scale. The dove weighed more
and the Emperor started putting more and more flesh
from his body to make the weight equal. But the dove
[Page012-a+ 59]
always weighed more and at last the Emperor said he
would weigh himself against the dove. As the weak and
fleshless Emperor was about to get into the pan of the
scale Agni and Indra emerged from the bodies of the
dove and hawk and appeared before the Emperor.
They blessed him and immediately took him to heaven.
(Chapter 131, Vana Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>10) {%Agni and the testicles of a goat.%} The occasion is when
sage Viśvāmitra is taking Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa to the
forests to give protection to the sages against the de-
mons. They reached the place where Ahalyā lay as a
stone cursed by Gautama. Viśvāmitra told them the
story: “It was here that the great sage, Gautama, lived
with his beautiful consort, Ahalyā. Once Indra had an
intercourse with her privately and Gautama coming to
know of the misdeed cursed her and turned her into
stone. By the curse of the same sage Indra lost his
testicles. Greatly aggrieved by this loss Indra prayed
to god Agni for help and on the advice of Agni the
devas removed the deformity by placing a goat's testi-
cles instead.” (Ślokas 48 & 49, Bāla Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki
Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>11) {%How sage Bhṛgu cursed Agni.%} Sage Bhṛgu was living
with his wife Pulomā in his āśrama. Pulomā became
pregnant. One day when Bhṛgu wanted to go out for
a bath in the river he asked Agni to keep a watch over
his pregnant wife. There was a demon by name
Puloma who was once in love with Pulomā. On this
particular day Puloma entered the āśrama to see
his former love. When he entered the āśrama Puloma
saw Agni there burning with a brilliant flame in the
fire-pit. Puloma said: “O God of fire, if I ask you a
question you must give me an impartial reply. I was
in love with this Pulomā and I had accepted her as
my wife spiritually. But, then, her father gave her to
Bhṛgu. Who, then, is the true owner of Pulomā?”
Agni was afraid of Bhṛgu. Yet he explained the posi-
tion honestly. “It is true that Pulomā has married
Bhṛgu. But he has not married her according to Hindu
rites.” Hearing this the demon changed himself into
the shape of a swine and carried away Pulomā. On
the way Pulomā delivered a male babe and it fell on
the ground. The boy was named Cyavana. It was this
boy that became later on the famous Cyavana Maha-
rṣi. Even at birth the boy was brilliant as the Sun
to look at and Puloma, the demon, noticing the un-
usual brilliance of the child left the mother and child
on the way and fled frightened. Pulomā returned to the
āśrama carrying the child weeping profusely all the
way and creating a lachrymal river called Vadhū-
saras. As soon as she entered the āśrama the angry
sage asked “Who told Puloma that you are my wife?”
Pulomā then told her husband all that happened there
and Bhṛgu called Agni and cursed him thus: “May
you be a consumer of all things on this Earth”. Great-
ly aggrieved Agni went away and hid himself. The
absence of Agni created chaos in all the three worlds;
Heaven, Earth and the Nether-world. A deputation of
all the afflicted people waited upon Brahmā and
[Page012-b+ 65]
Brahmā modified the curse and declared that all that
Agni touched would become pure. Agni was consoled
and he started his work as usual.
<div n="NI"/>12) {%How Agni cursed frogs, birds and elephants.%} Many
important events took place while Agni was under-
ground cursed by Bhṛgu. It was during that time that
Pārvatī cursed all the Devas and the Devas were
defeated by the asuras (demons). The necessity of a
warrior capable of defeating the asuras arose then.
The idea of creating Lord Subrahmaṇya came up and
Brahmā said that only Agni could help them in this
matter since Agni was the only one who escaped from
the curse of Pārvatī, being underground at the time
of the curse. The Devas started a vigilant search but
Agni was not to be found. Agni was then hiding inside
the ocean. The ocean was getting hot and the animals
living there found their life unbearable. Frogs went to
the devas and told them where Agni was hiding.
Enraged at this Agni cursed the frogs saying that they
would never be able to find the taste of anything.
Frogs went weeping to the devas who in turn blessed
the frogs saying that they would acquire the ability to
move about easily in any darkness. Agni changed his
place of hiding and went and hid in a big banyan
tree. An elephant going by that way found him out
and informed the devas; knowing this Agni cursed
the elephants saying that its tongue would go deep
inside. But the devas blessed the elephants saying that
the position of the tongue would never be a hindrance
to free eating and that elephants would be able to eat
anything and everything. Agni left the banyan tree
and hid himself in the hollow of a Śamī tree. A little
bird living in that tree gave information to the devas
and the devas found him out before he got time to
leave the place. Agni cursed the bird saying that its
tongue would always be curved inside and the devas
blessed it saying that the curvature would help it to
sing beautiful songs. Since Agni was found out from
Śamī tree this tree became sacred. Since this finding
out of Agni after a long absence is like a re-birth of
Agni the Purāṇas mention that Agni was born from
the Śamī tree. The Devas then requested Agni to help
them to create a son capable of conquering the de-
mons.
<F>*) Kathāsaritsāgara gives another version of why Agni went and hid himself under the ocean. When Kāma, the God of Love, was
burnt to death by Śiva, Pārvatī, Śivā's wife, did not find a way to get a child for her from her husband. At last Brahmā approached Śiva and
told him that the absence of Kāma was making creation difficult. Śiva then declared that thereafter Kāma would find a place in the minds of all
living beings including himself. Pārvatī and Śiva immediately commenced a sexual life which went on incessantly for a hundred years with-
out reaching the climax. The world was agitated and the universe stood on the verge of ruin. The Devas decided to send Agni to intervene But
Agni was afraid of Śiva and so went and bid himself under the ocean. (Chapter 6, Lāvāṇakalambaka of Kathāsaritsāgara).</F> (Chapter 85, Anuśāsana Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>13) {%Birth of Subrahmaṇya.%} At that time Varuṇa performed
a yāga. All the dikpālakas (zone guardians of the
universe) including Śiva participated in the yāga.
Seeing the beautiful wives of the sages Śiva had emission.
Taking the semen in his hand he put it into the fire.
Agni carried it to Gaṅgā and requested her to take it
for conception. Though she at first refused she took it,
became pregnant and finally delivered a male child
whom she threw into the forest Śaravaṇa. It was this
child who became known as Kārttikeya or Subrah-
maṇya later on. (Chapter 85, Anuśāsana Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>14) {%How Agni blessed Nala.%} While Nala was going to the
wedding of Damayantī Indra, Agni, Varuṇa and Kāla
accosted him on his way and asked him to go as a
messenger of theirs and advise Damayantī to marry one
[Page013-a+ 65]
of them. Nala did so but Damayantī was adamant and
said she would marry none other than Nala. So all the
four gods appeared as Nala in the wedding hall.
Damayantī who was confused prayed that she should
be shown the real Nala. The gods then changed into
their original forms and blessed Nala. Agni said he
would come and help him the moment he wanted him.
Thus Nala became a good cook and Nala Pācakaṃ
(Pācakaṃ=cooking) became famous. Even now it is a
synonym for good cooking. (Chapter 57, Vana Parva,
M.B)
<div n="NI"/>15) {%Agni and Raṃbhā.%} There was once a dānava called
Danu. He had two sons named Raṃbha and Karaṃ-
bha. They had no children and tormented by this
they went to Pañcanada and started doing penance.
Raṃbha sat in the centre of Pañcāgni (five fires) and
Karaṃbha in water to do penance. Indra afraid of the
severe and powerful tapas of the two took the form of
a crocodile and killed Karaṃbha who was doing pe-
nance in water by dragging him down to the water. Be-
reaved Raṃbha started to commit suicide by jumping
into the fire. God Agni appeared before him then and
asked him what he wanted. Raṃbha then said that he
should get a son who would be famous as a warrior in
all the three worlds. Agni agreed. Raṃbha on his way
back saw a voluptuous she-buffalo and married her
at yakṣa kavāṭa. They lived a happy married life and
one day a he-buffalo envious of their life attacked
Raṃbha and killed him. Grief-stricken Raṃbha's wife
jumped into the funeral pyre and committed suicide.
Then from the fire arose a demon named Mahiṣāsura
(Mahiṣa=Buffalo. Asura=Demon). This buffalo-
demon became a terror to all in the three worlds later
on. (Chapter 5, Devī Bhāgavata).
<div n="NI"/>16) {%Difference of opinion between Agni and Aṅgiras.%} Bhaga-
vān Aṅgiras did penance in his own āśrama and
became more brilliant than Agni. The whole world
was submerged in his brilliance. Agni felt a bit depress-
ed at this. Agni argued that it was not proper on the
part of Brahmā to give anybody else more brilliance
than himself. So as a protest against this Agni dis-
appeared from the world. Even Aṅgiras was annoyed at
Agni's disappearance and so he went and consoled Agni
and took him to Brahmā. Brahmā declared that hence-
forth the world world recognize Agni as the father and
Aṅgiras as his son. Thus Agni got the first place in
effulgence. This is a story told by sage Mārkaṇḍeya
to Dharmaputra. (Chapter 217, Vana Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>17) {%Agni and Mahābali.%} On their way to the forest sage
Viśvāmitra took Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa to Siddhāśrama.
The sage explained to the princes the importance of
that āśrama. He said: “Mahāviṣṇu lived in this āśrama
for a number of years. It was at that time that the
Emperor of the asuras (demons), Mahābali, son of
Virocana, was ruling the world conquering even the
devas. After having conquered all the three worlds
Mahābali decided to conduct a yāga. A deputation
of the Devas headed by Agni then waited upon Mahā-
viṣṇu and Agni said: “O Lord, Mahābali has com-
menced a yāga and before it is finished you should go
to him and do something for the benefit of the
devas”. It was at this request of Agni that Mahāviṣṇu
took the form of Vāmana and sent Mahābali to the
nether-world. (Chapter 29, Bālakāṇḍa, Vālmīki
Rāmāyaṇa).
[Page013-b+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>18) {%Agni and Nahuṣa.%} Repenting for his act of killing
Vṛtra Indra unknown to anybody went and hid in a
lotus in the Mānasa Saras (Lake Mānasa). Perplexed
by the disappearance of their leader the devas brought
Nahuṣa from the Earth and made him their leader.
Nahuṣa became very proud and arrogant of his new
position and tried to make Indrāṇī his wife. Indrāṇī
went to Bṛhaspatī for help. Bṛhaspati commanded
Agni to go and find out Indra. Agni searched for him
in forests, rivers and oceans. At last he went to
Mānasa Saras and searched among the lotuses. There
he found Indra hiding in a lotus and Bṛhaspati was
duly informed. Then Bṛhaspati gave Indrāṇī some
clever directions to kill Nahuṣa and Nahuṣa was
killed. (See Agastya). There is a story in Śānti Parva,
Chapter 28, of how Agni took for himself a quarter of
the sin which Indra acquired because of his killing
Vṛtra, a brahmin by birth. (Chapter 14, Udyoga
Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>19) {%Agni Deva and Kārttavīryārjuna.%} After the great
Kurukṣetra battle the Pāṇḍavas went again to Kuru-
kṣetra along with Śrī Kṛṣṇa. On their way Kṛṣṇa
showed them the Paraśurāmahradas and narrated to
them several stories of Rāma. Reference to Agni
comes when Kṛṣṇa explains the reason why Paraśurāma
cut off the thousand hands of Kārttavīryārjuna. It was
at the time when Kārttavīryārjuna was ruling the
three worlds by his might that Agni went and asked for
alms from him. Kārttavīrya gave Agni mountains and
forests for his food which Agni burnt and ate. In one
of the forests was the āśrama of sage Āpava and that
also was burnt. Enraged at this the sage cursed Kārtta-
vīrya saying that his thousand hands would be cut off
by Paraśurāma. Though the curse was not seriously
minded by the King then, it so happened that before
long Kārttavīrya had to encounter Paraśurāma in a
battle when the children of the King stole a sacrificial
cow belonging to Jamadagni, father of Paraśurāma.
In the battle all the thousand hands of Kārtta-
vīryārjuna were cut off by Paraśurāma. (Chapter 43,
Śānti Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>20) {%How Agni was duped.%} Once the wives of the Sapta-
ṛṣis (seven Saints) attended a yāga where Agni was
also present. Agni fell in love with them but knowing
it to be futile to make any attempt to fulfil his desire
he went to the forests dejected. Svāhādevī, daughter of
Dakṣa was for a long time craving to marry Agni and
she decided to take advantage of the opportunity thus
offered. Disguising herself as the wife of Aṅgiras, one
of the seven saints, she approached Agni and said: “O
Lord, I am Śivā, wife of Aṅgiras. We were all excited
when you darted cupids' arrows against us and they
have now selected me to come to you for fulfilling your
desire”. Agni believed her and took her as his consort.
(Chapters 223 to 227 of Vana Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>21) {%How Agni became a doctor.%} There was once a sage
called Dattātreya who had a son called Nimi. Nimi
had a son and he died after thousand years. The
bereaved sage performed a Śrāddha which was attend-
ed by all devas. The feast was so sumptuous that the
devas got indigestion after that. Consulting Brahmā
Agni prescribed a remedy for their indigestion. He said:
“whenever you take any food make me also a partici-
pant in that. If you do so you will never get indiges-
tion”. That is why a very small portion of any cooked
[Page014-a+ 65]
food is first thrown into the fire before given for eat-
ing. This story is part of Bhīṣma's oration to Dharma-
putra on the origin of Śrāddha (The ceremony con-
ducted on the anniversary of the death of a person by
his son). (Chapter 92, Anuśāsana Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>22) {%How Agni became a horse.%} There was once a precep-
tor named Āveda. He got a disciple named Uttaṅga.
One day Āveda left his āśrama for a distant place
leaving his disciple in charge of the management of the
āśrama. The preceptor was absent for a long time and
his wife started making love to Uttaṅga. The dutiful
disciple strongly objected to this. When Uttaṅga com-
pleted his course of study under Āveda he enquired
what he should give to his preceptor. The preceptor
directed him to his wife. The wife who bore a grudge
against Uttaṅga resolved to tease him and said that
he should go to King Pauṣya and beg of him the
earrings worn by his wife. Uttaṅga started immediately
and getting the earrings was coming back when on
the way Takṣaka wrested the ornament from him and
went and hid in the nether-world. Uttaṅga followed
Takṣaka and there Agni in the form of a horse appear-
ed before him and asked Uttaṅga what he wanted.
He replied that he wanted to subdue all the serpents in
the nether-world. Agni then advised him to blow thro'
the nostrils of the horse. As he did so flames burst forth
from all the openings of the horse making the nether-
world hot and smoky. Takṣaka was frightened and he
at once gave back the earrings to Uttaṅga. Uttaṅga
was again worried for he had very little time to carry the
earrings to the preceptor in time. Here again Agni helped
him by carrying him swiftly on his back to the āśrama.
When the preceptor and his wife found that Uttaṅga
had carried out their wish they blessed him. (Chapter
3, Ādi Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>23) {%Agni becomes a messenger.%} Once there arose a mis-
understanding between Bṛhaspati and Saṃvarttaka,
sons of Aṅgiras. Bṛhaspati went to devaloka as priest
while the other remained in the world as a mad saint.
At that time a King called Marutta invited Bṛhaspati to
officiate as priest for a yajña of his. But Bṛhaspati
refused to accept it. Nārada saw Marutta in despair
and told him thus: “You go to Kāśī (Benares) and
there at Puradvāra place a dead body and wait there.
Saṃvarttaka, Bṛhaspati's brother will come and repri-
mand you. Without minding his scoldings follow him
and request him to become the chief priest for your
yāga. He will then ask you who advised you to do
like this. Tell him that Nārada did so and if he asks
where he could find Nārada do tell him that Nārada
is hiding inside Agni”. Hearing this Marutta went to
Kāśī and did all as directed. Saṃvartta agreed to be-
come the priest but wanted Marutta to bring some gold
from Kailāsa before that. Marutta brought that also
and the yajña started. Bṛhaspati when he came to know
of all these developments became sorry for his refusal
first and decided to become the priest of Marutta for his
yāga. It was Agni who carried this message of consent
to King Marutta. Thus Marutta's yajña was performed
in a grand way. (Chapter 9, Aśvamedha Parva, M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>24) {%Agni takes back the Gāṇḍīva.%} At the time of
Khāṇḍava dahana (burning of Khāṇḍava forest) Agni
gave Arjuna the famous Gāṇḍīva bow which Varuṇa
had given him. After the great Mahābhārata battle
Agni took back this bow from Arjuna. The Pāṇḍavas

at the fag end of their life started on a pilgrimage to
the south with their consort Pāñcālī. Marching along
slowly they reached the shores of Aruṇa Samudra
(Aruṇa Ocean). Arjuna had with him then the Gāṇḍīva
and also the arrow-case which never becomes empty.
When they reached the shores of the ocean Agni blocked
their way standing before them in the form of a huge
mountain and said, “O Arjuna I am god Agni. It was I
who gave this famous Gāṇḍīva bow to you. The bow
belongs to Varuṇa. So please throw it into the ocean
and proceed on your way”. On hearing this Arjuna
threw both the bow and the arrow-case into the ocean
and continued the march. (Ślokas 33 to 43, Chapter
1, Mahāprasthānika Parva, M.B.).

<div n="NI"/>11) In the beginning Brahmā created the universe.
There was no death then and the Earth became over-
crowded. Brahmā got worried and he sent fire from his
body to burn all beings. The world was on the verge
of extinction when Lord Śiva intervened and requested
Brahmā to withdraw Agni and create the god of Death.
(Chapter 52, Droṇa Parva. M.B.).
<div n="NI"/>12) Agni is one of the Aṣṭa Vasūs which are eight in

<div n="NI"/>16) Agni was born to Pururavas as a son named Jāta-
vedas. (Chapter 14, Navama Skandha of Bhāgavata).
[Page015-a+ 65]
<div n="NI"/>17) The Devas wanted help to clean their hands when
oblated materials stuck to their hands and Agni creat-
ed from water three sons named Ekata, Dvita and
Trita for this purpose. Of these Trita fell into a well
while drawing water. Seeing him fall the demons
closed the well but Trita broke the top and came out.
(Sūkta 52, Anuvāka 10, Maṇḍala 1 of Ṛgveda).
<div n="NI"/>18) Once the earth looked like heaven because of the
innumerable celestial beings who came to earth in search

evening and takes it back from him in the morning. (A
fact from Śruti—Sūkta 71, Anuvāka 12, Maṇḍala 1 of
Ṛgveda).
<div n="NI"/>20) For making fire for the sacrificial ceremony the
sages use two Araṇi sticks (These are two pieces of wood,
one upper and another lower, and fire is produced by
attrition). It is believed that the sages get the strength
to produce fire from it through Vyāna, one of the forms
of Vāyu (air). So Ṛgveda describes Agni as the son of
Vāyu. (Sūkta 112, Anuvāka 16, Maṇḍala 1).
<div n="NI"/>21) In the times of the Ṛgveda Agni was worshipped
as a God. (Sūkta 1, Anuvāka 1, Maṇḍala 1, Ṛgveda).
<div n="NI"/>22) Lord Śiva entered into an elaborate and long
conjugal play for creating Subrahmaṇya. Hundred
years went by and still the preliminaries never ended.
The universe was on the verge of a collapse and so
the devas decided to send Agni to put a stop to this
libidinal play of Śiva. But Agni was afraid of Śiva and
therefore absconded and hid himself in the ocean. The
ocean became hot and the water-animals unable to
bear the increasing heat went and informed the devas of
Agni's hiding place. Agni cursed them all saying that all
of them would go dumb. He then went to the Mandara
mountain in the shape of an owl and hid there. But the
devas went there also and picked him up. Agni then by
his terrible heat stimulated Śiva into action. Śiva
threw his semen into Agni and Agni poured it into
Gaṅgā and Gaṅgā delivered a child which later on be-
came Subrahmaṇya. (Taraṅga 6, Lāvāṇakalaṃbaka
of Kathāsaritsāgara).
<div n="NI"/>26) {%Conclusion.%} Agni stands next to Indra in impor-
tance in the Vedas. Because Agnī was indispensable for
yāgas the care of Agni became very important. Accord-
ing to the Ṛgveda the birth of Agni is different. Born
of the clouds Agni reaches the earth as lightning. Then
Agni forsakes its form and becomes invisible. It was
Mātariśvā who gave form to Agni and gave him to the
Bhṛgu family. From that day onwards it became
possible to produce fire and the Ṛgveda describes how
Agni is produced by sages by the use of Araṇi sticks.
The main job of Agni is to receive the oblations from
devas when they conduct yāgas.
