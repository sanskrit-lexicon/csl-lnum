told in Viṣṇudharmottara Purāṇa about the birth of
Dhūmaketu.
<div n="NI"/>Noting that the population on earth had increased
abnormally Brahmā created a damsel called Mṛtyu and
asked her to kill people. At this command of Brahmā
she began crying, and from her tear drops various kinds
of diseases originated at the sight of which she took to
penance. Then Brahmā appeared and blessed her say-
ing that no one would die because of her at which she
heaved a great sigh of relief from which was born Ketu
or Dhūmaketu.
