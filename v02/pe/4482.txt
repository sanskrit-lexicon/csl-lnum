MĀYĀVĪ¦. An asura.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Birth.%} Māyāvī was born to the great architect of
the Dānavas, Maya, of his wife Hemā, a nymph. Maya
fell in love with Hemā when he once found her dancing
in Devaloka and the devas coming to know of it gave her
in marriage to Maya. Maya took Hemā to the southern
side of the Himālayas and constructing a city there
called Hemapura stayed there happily. They got two
sons named Māyāvī and Dundubhi. (Uttara Rāmā-
yaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Death.%} Valorous Māyāvī fought against anybody and
everybody. He once challenged Bāli to a fight. But the
mighty blows of Bāli were unbearable to him and the
defeated Māyāvī ran away from Bāli and hid himself
in a big cave. Bāli followed him and when he reached
the mouth of the cave he posted his brother Sugrīva
there with instructions to shut tight the opening of the
cave in case he died in the cave in the fight. He said
that if blood flowed from the cave the dead person was
Māyāvī and if milk flowed from the cave the dead person
was himself. In the cave a great fight ensued in which
Māyāvī was killed. But Māyāvī by his powers of magic
made the blood that flowed out look like milk for
Sugrīva and the latter thinking that it was his brother
who was killed shut tight the mouth of the cave and went
his way. (Sarga 9, Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa
and Pūrva Kāṇḍa, Kamba Rāmāyaṇa.
