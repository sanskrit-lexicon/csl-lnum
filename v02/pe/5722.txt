<div n="NI"/>1) {%General information.%} Ṛbhus are a group of divine be-
ings who attained divinity by performing tapas. Mahā-
bhārata, Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 137, Verse 25 says
that even other gods worship the Ṛbhus.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Who were Ṛbhus?%} Aṅgiras, the son of Brahmā had a

<div n="NI"/>(i) Long ago, a cow belonging to a Ṛṣi died. Its calf
began to cry. The Ṛṣi took pity on it and prayed to the

Ṛbhus. They made a cow and covered it with the skin
of the dead cow and placed it in front of the calf. Be-
cause of its likeness to its mother, the calf believed it to
be its mother.

to youth. (Ṛgveda, 1st Maṇḍala, 16th Anuvāka. 11th
