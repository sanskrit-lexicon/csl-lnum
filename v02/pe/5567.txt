PUṢPAVĀHANA¦. A King of Rathantarakalpa. He
got ten thousand sons of his wife Lāvaṇyavatī. Puṣpa-
vāhana was a hunter in his previous birth. He used to
give daily lotus flowers to a harlot who was doing
worship of Viṣṇu observing the Dvādaśīvrata. He was
doing this service with such devotion that in the next
birth he was born under the name Puṣpavāhana
(carrier of flowers). The sage Bhṛgu once told him
about his previous birth and asked him to observe
dvādaśīvrata. Puṣpavāhana observed the vrata and
attained bliss. (Sṛṣṭi khaṇḍa, Padma Purāṇa).
