CANDRĀVALOKA¦. A King of Citrakūṭanagara.
<div n="NI"/>When once the King in the course of a hunting expedition
came to the bank of a river tired and done up he saw
there the very beautiful lady, Indīvaraprabhā, daughter
of Maharṣi Kaṇva by Menakā. Having fallen in love
with each other they went to the āśrama of the maharṣi
where, at his instance, Candrāvaloka took the pledge not
to kill animals in future, and Kaṇva married his daugh-
ter to the King. On their way back to the palace the
couple went to sleep on the banks of a pool which be-
longed to a Brahmarakṣas, who caught hold of them,
but released them on condition that they gave him in
their stead a brahmin boy aged seven. Thus they re-
turned to Citrakūṭa and told about the incident to
minister Sumati. As advised by Sumati an idol in gold
equal in size to a brahmin boy aged seven was made and
a proclamation was issued that the golden idol would
be given to him who, in return, give a brahmin boy
seven years old. A brahmin boy was got, and he was
given to the Brahmarakṣas. (Kathāsaritsāgara Śaśāṅka-
vatī Laṃbaka, Taraṅga 27).
