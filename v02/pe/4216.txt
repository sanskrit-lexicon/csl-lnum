MAINDA¦. One of the monkeys who helped Śrī Rāma
in the search for Sītā. Purāṇas give the following
information regarding this monkey:
<div n="NI"/>(i) Mainda lived in a cave in Kiṣkindhā. While he
was living there Sahadeva one of the Pāṇḍavas came
that way during his victory campaign in Dakṣiṇa
Bhārata and fought with him. Sahadeva was defeated.
But Mainda was pleased with him and gave him many
valuable presents and advised him that no difficulties
should be put against Dharmaputra achieving his
object. (Śloka 18, Chapter 31, Sabhā Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(ii) Mainda was the minister of Sugrīva, King of the
monkeys. He was mighty, intelligent, and kind to
others. (Śloka 23, Chapter 28, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(iii) Mainda was one of the leaders who led the
monkeys who went in search of Sītā. (Śloka 19,
Chapter 283, Vana Parva).
<div n="NI"/>(iv) In the Rāma-Rāvaṇa battle Mainda and others
also fainted along with Lakṣmaṇa and others. It was
only when they washed their faces with the water
given by Kubera that they could see things clearly.
<div n="NI"/>(v) Mainda was the son of A vinīdevas. (10th
Skandha, Bhāgavata).
