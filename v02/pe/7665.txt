UDDAṆḌAŚĀSTRĪ¦. One of the eighteen and a half
famous poets of Kerala. He was a Sanskrit poet. His
native place was Lāṭapura on the bank of river Pālār
in Toṇḍamaṇḍala in the Tamilnad. The name of his
father was Śrī Kṛṣṇa and that of his mother was Raṅgā-
devī. Poet Ulloor says that Śāstrī had another name
Irugupanātha. He had a very good education. After
having completed his education, he travelled through
Āndhra, Karṇāṭaka, Kaliṅga, Cola, Kerala and many
other countries and finally came to Kozhikode and
visited the King Mānavikramamahārāja. At the instance
of the king he composed the drama called Mallikāmā-
rutam. Besides this we have obtained only the ‘Kokila-
sandeśa’ and some other single poems of Śāstrī. It is said
that there is a thesis on dramas also. Śāstrī was not
in the habit of respecting those who did not pay respect
to him, however superior they might be. So some say
that he was arrogant. A Malayāla Brahmin called
Bhaṭṭatiri of Kākkaśśeri, rose against Śāstrī in Kerala.
