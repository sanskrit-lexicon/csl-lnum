GADĀVASĀNA¦. A particular centre in Madhurāpurī.
The name owes its origin to the following reason. When
Kṛṣṇa killed Kaṃsa, his father-in-law Jarāsandha got
so angry that he hurled his gadā (club) ninetynine
times at Madhurāpurī from his capital, Girivraja. The
spot where the gadā finally fell came to be called Gadā-
vasāna in course of time. (M.B. Sabhā Parva, Chapter
18, Verses 22-25).
