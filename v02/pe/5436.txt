PṚTHUGRĪVA¦. When Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were
staying in Pañcavaṭī a demoness named Śūrpaṇakhā
made approaches to them and Lakṣmaṇa cut off her
limbs and sent her away. Then a rākṣasa army came
under the leadership of Khara, Dūṣaṇa and Triśiras and
Pṛthugrīva was one of the twelve prominent soldiers of
that army.
