MOHINĪ¦. The female form of Mahāviṣṇu. Devas and
Asuras quarrelled with each other over the right of
partaking the Amṛta (nectar) obtained from the sea of
Milk. At that time Mahāviṣṇu appeared before them
in the guise of a beautiful maiden of maddening charm
and the asuras were guilefully made to turn their
attention on her for some time during which time the
nectar was carried away by the Devas. The female form
of Mahāviṣṇu was called Mohinī.
<div n="NI"/>Śiva fell in love with Mohinī and by the union of the
two was born Śāstā. (See under Amṛtam). (8th
Skandha, Bhāgavata).
