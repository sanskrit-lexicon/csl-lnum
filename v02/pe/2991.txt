JĪMŪTA¦. II. A wrestler (Pahalvān). While the Pāṇḍa-
vas were living incognito in the city of Virāṭa, once
Brahmotsava (Brahmā festival) was celebrated all over
the country. Wrestling was an important item of the
Brahmā festival. Jīmūta was the most famous of the
wrestlers who took part in the festival. He struck several
wrestlers down. At last King Virāṭa asked Bhīma to
wrestle with Jīmūta. Bhīmasena accepted the invita-
tion. In the wrestling Jīmūta was killed. (M.B. Virāṭa
Parva, Chapter 16).
