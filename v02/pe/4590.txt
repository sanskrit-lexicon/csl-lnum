MUDGALA III¦. (MAUDGALYA). A sage of Purāṇic
fame.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Mudgala and Durvāsas.%} Mudgala had never been
provoked even once by anger. Durvāsas once came to
the āśrama of Mudgala in Kurukṣetra where he was
living on alms received by begging. Durvāsas came
naked. Mudgala gave all that he got that day to
Durvāsas. The latter ate to his heart's content and
smeared on his naked body what remained after his
meal. Mudgala never got angry. This continued for
days together and not for once did Mudgala get angry.
Durvāsas was immensely pleased with this behaviour
of Mudgala and he offered to send him to heaven with
his body. Devas came with a Vimāna at once.
Mudgala after enquiring about the conveniences and
luxuries of heaven refused to go. (Chapter 261, Vana
Parva).
