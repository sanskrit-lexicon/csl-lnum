CITAL¦. (Termites). Cital has got its own place in the
purāṇas. Devī Bhāgavata has the following story about
the origin of it.
<div n="NI"/>Mahāviṣṇu once looking at the face of Lakṣmī laughed
without any apparent reason. Lakṣmī, thinking that
Viṣṇu was laughing at her and that he had an eye on
some other woman more beautiful than her lost her
temper and cursed Viṣṇu that his head would be severed
from his body.
<div n="NI"/>No sooner was the curse pronounced than the asuras came
in batches fully armed and challenged Viṣṇu to war.
Single-handed the Lord fought the asuras with one bow.
The fight did not end though it continued for thousands
of years. Viṣṇu felt tired and decided to rest awhile.
He planted one end of the untied bow on the ground,
rested his chin on the other and sat in Padmāsana.
Being very tired the Lord remained asleep for a long
time in this posture.
<div n="NI"/>About this time the devas made preparations to perform
a yajña. All the devas except Mahāviṣṇu attended that
yajña. Since he was the master of yajñas performed for
purposes of the devas they could not begin it in his
absence. So, Brahmā and others went in search
of Viṣṇu to Vaikuṇṭha. But he was not to be found there.
Then Brahmā and others found out with their
eyes of knowledge where Viṣṇu was and they went to
the place where he was sleeping. They waited there
for a long time, yet Viṣṇu did not awake from sleep.
Then Brahmā hit at a plan to awaken Viṣṇu. It was
to create citals (termites) to eat the end of the bow.
When they had eaten away the end of the bow
planted on the ground the cord binding the two ends
of it would break, the bow would straighten up and the
speedy movement of it would awaken Viṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>According to this plan Brahmā created citals, but his
other plans were not acceptable to the citals. They
argued that the advantage of awakening the Lord from
sleep would go only to the devas, while its sin would
fall upon them.
<div n="NI"/>They argued,
<Poem>Nidrābhaṅgaḥ kathāchedo
Dampatyoḥ prītibhedanam /
Śiśumātṛvibhedaśca
Brahmahatyāsamaṃ smṛtam //</Poem>
<F>*) To disturb one in sleep, to interrupt a story, to separate husband and wife as also mother and child from each other—these things
are tantamount to Brahmahatyā (killing of the brahmin).</F>
Brahmā conceded the justness of this argument and
agreed that, in future, a part of the result of yajñas
shall go to citals. It was after this that havis (sacrificial
offering) which, in the course of being submitted to the
fire falls on the sides of the pit of fire became the share
of citals (termites). This promise of Brahmā pleased the
the citals, and they did as was bidden by Brahmā and
[Page184-a+ 65]
the bow of Viṣṇu straightened up with a terrific sound.
The devas were terror-stricken, the whole universe
shook, the earth experienced a convulsion and the oceans
too were shaken. Moreover, the head of Viṣṇu was
severed from the body, rose high up in the sky and fell
into the sea. Brahmā, Śiva and others opened their eyes
only to find the body of Viṣṇu lying thus without the
head.
<div n="NI"/>This loss of Viṣṇu's head proved to be useful in another
way. Now, Hayagrīva, after securing the boon from
Brahmā that he would be killed only by one with horse's
head, was running rough-shod over the whole earth.
The devas cut off the head of a horse and attached it to
the trunk of Viṣṇu. Thus Viṣṇu came to life again, and
according to his orders the citals gnawed away the cord
of Hayagrīva's bow as a result of which he was killed.
