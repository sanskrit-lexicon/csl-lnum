SURABHI II¦. A cow born from the ‘Huṃkāra’ (the
sound ‘hum’) of Brahmā. As the cow grew up, milk
began dripping down on earth from its udder and
gradually it formed into the Kṣīrasāgara (ocean of
milk). Four daughters, Surūpā, Haṃsikā, Subhadrā
and Sarvakāmadhuk were born to Surabhi and they
are considered to be protectors of the four regions.
Surabhi lives in the seventh world beneath the earth i.e.
Rasātala. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 100).
