SUBĀHU¦ XIV. A Cola King. A great devotee of
Viṣṇu, the King performed many yajñas. Though he
lived according to the spiritual advice of his precep-
tor Jaimini he was denied the sight of Viṣṇu. Ultimate-
ly Subāhu and his queen attained heaven as they
listened to Vijvala, their second son, reciting hymns
addressed to Vāsudeva. (Padma Purāṇa, Bhūmi
Khaṇḍa, Chapter 94).
<div n="NI"/>Though Subāhu and his queen worshipped Viṣṇu for a
long time in the Ānanda forest, the lord did not appear
to them. Ultimately they forsook their bodies in the
forest and after a very long walk came to the abode of
munis. The king queried them as to why he failed to see
Viṣṇu though he performed penance for a very long time.
The King and queen were done up due to hunger and
thirst and the munis asked them to return to Ānandāś-
rama and eat the corpses left there. While they
were accordingly eating the corpses, Vijvala ques-
tioned Kuñjala a bird which lived nearby, why his
parents were eating dead bodies. The bird answered
that when the King and queen had recited the praises
of Vāsudeva they would see Viṣṇu. It also taught Vij-
vala songs in praise of Viṣṇu. After having studied
the songs, Vijvala went and sat on a tree at ānandāś-
rama and sang the songs. Subāhu and his queen repeat-
ed them and immediately Viṣṇu appeared before them
and conducted them to heaven.
