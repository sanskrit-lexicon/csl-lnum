DĀMODARA¦. Śrī Kṛṣṇa. When Śrī Kṛṣṇa was a small
boy, Yaśodā tied him to a mortar-stone. The boy ran
about, dragging the heavy stone with him and the rope
snapped. Part of the rope still remained round his
abdomen. From that he got the name Dāmodara.
“Dama” means rope and “Udara” means abdomen.
(See Kṛṣṇa).
