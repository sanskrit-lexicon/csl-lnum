BRAHMADATTA II¦. Another King who ruled over
Kāṃpilya. This King was the son of the hermit Cūli
and his wife Somadā, a Gandharva woman whose
mother was Ūrmilā. When he was ruling Kāṃpilya,
Kuśanābha was the King of Kānyakubja. One hund-
red beautiful daughters were born to the King
Kuśanābha. One day while they were playing in the
jungle Vāyubhagavān (wind-god) saw them and grew
lustful. But they did not yield to his request. So he got
angry and cursed them and they became hump-backed.
The King was very sorry. He presented his hundred
hunch-backed daughters to King Brahmadatta, who,
by his divine power straightened their backs. When
they regained their former form they became the wives
of Brahmadatta. This story occurs in Vālmīki Rāmā-
yaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, Sargas 32 & 33.
