INDĪVARASENA¦. Son of Parityāgasena a King who
ruled the city of Irāvatī. Parityāgasena had two
queens—Adhikasaṃgamā and Kāvyālaṅkāra. As they

had no children, the distressed King with his queens
worshipped the goddess Durgā. Durgā gave the King
two fruits. She blessed that the queens would bear
children when they ate the fruits. Adhikasaṃgamā ate
both the fruits without showing them to the other wife.
Two sons were born to her. Indīvarasena was the elder
son. (Kathāsaritsāgara, Ratnaprabhā laṃbaka, 8th
Taraṅga).
