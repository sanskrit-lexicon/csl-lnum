HAYAGRĪVA V¦. An incarnation of Viṣṇu.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%In Vedic literature:%}—In Vedic literature incarnation
as Hayagrīva is attributed not to Viṣṇu, but to Yajña.
But the Taittirīya āraṇyaka depicts yajña as a proto-
form of Viṣṇu. The inference that may be drawn from
the above is that the root of the Hayagrīva story
detailed in Vedic and Purāṇic literature is one and the
same.
<div n="NI"/>About the Hayagrīva incarnation the Pañcaviṃsa-
brāhmaṇa contains the following story.
<div n="NI"/>Agni, Indra, Vāyu and Yajña (Viṣṇu) once began a
yajña on the understanding that the havirbhāga
obtained from it should be divided among all the
[Page312-a+ 64]
Devas. But, in violation of the agreement, yajña left
the place carrying away the whole Yajñabhāga with
him, and he drove back the Devas who followed him
with the help of the bow presented to him by Devī.
Finally the Devas got the string of the bow bitten off
by termites and the bow which got straightened up
cut off yajña's head. Yajña then apologized for his
offence and then the devas got the Aśvinīdevas to fix
the head of a horse to the trunk of Yajña. (Pañca-
viṃśabrāhmaṇa 7, 5, 6; Taittirīya āraṇyaka 5, 1;
Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 4-9, 1).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%In Purāṇic literature.%} The above story is told in
Skanda Purāṇa with slight modifications as follows:-
<div n="NI"/>Once Brahmā and other Devatās conducted a test as to
which one amongst them was the greatest, and when
it became evident tha tMahāviṣṇu was, in every respect,
superior to all the others Brahmā cursed that Viṣṇu
should lose his head. Viṣṇu, who got thus bereft of his
head attended a yajña conducted by the Devas with the
head of a horse attached to his trunk. After the yajña
was over he went to dharmāraṇya and did tapas there
and by the blessings of Śiva got back his former head
instead of that of the horse.
