JVĀLĀ II¦. The wife of Nīladhvaja. There is a story about
this Jvālā in the “Jaimini Aśvamedha Parva”, Chapter
15, as follows:
<div n="NI"/>The Pāṇḍavas began the sacrifice of Aśvamedha. Arjuna
led the sacrificial horse. He continued his victorious
march defeating all Kings and reached the city of Nīla-
dhvaja. Nīladhvaja was not prepared for a fight. Seeing
this his wife Jvālā tried various ways to push her
husband to war. Seeing them to be futile she approa-
ched her brother Unmūka and asked him to fight with
Arjuna. He also was not prepared to fight with Arjuna.
Jvālā became very angry and walked to the bank of the
Ganges. When the Ganges-water touched her feet
she stopped and said, “Dear me ! I am become sinful
[Page359-b+ 62]
by the touch of Ganges-water.” The amazed Gaṅgā
took the form of Sumaṅgalādevī and stood before Jvālā
and aked her the reason for saying so. Jvālā said “Gaṅ-
gādevī submerged her seven sons and killed them. After
that she took the eighth son from Śantanu. That son
too was killed by Arjuna in the Bhārata-battle. Thus
Gaṅgā is childless and sinful.” Hearing this Gaṅgā
Devī cursed Arjuna “Let his head be cut off in six
months’ time.” Jvālā was satisfied. (For the result of
the curse see under Arjuna, Para 28).
