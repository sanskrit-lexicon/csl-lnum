ŚABARĪ¦. A woman of the tribe of forest-dwellers. Śrī
Rāma, during his life in the forest, gave her salvation.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Former life.%} Śabarī, in her former life, was the only
daughter Mālinī of the Gandharva King, Citrakavaca.
An erudite scholar, Vītihotra, married her. As he was
ever immersed in contemplation of Brahman his wife
Mālinī, (later Śabarī) kept one hunter, Kalmāṣa, as
her paramour, and her husband cursed her thus: “As
you have become a lover of the hunter, you turn out
to be a hunter-woman.”
<div n="NI"/>2) {%At the Suburbs of Mataṅga's hermitage.%}
Mālinī in tears sought redemption from the curse from
her husband, and he told her that she would get ab-
solution from her infamy and the curse from Śrī Rāma.
Immediately she was transformed into a hunter-woman
and she came to the suburbs of Mataṅgāśrama. She took
a special liking for the place, the reason being that the
flowers in the āśrama possessed a special fragrance.
Once while the disciples were carrying a load of
flowers for the muni (Mataṅga) a few drops of sweat
from their bodies fell on the ground, and the muni
blessed that the trees and creepers, which grew up
from the sweat and their flowers would never fade.
This is described as follows in Canto 73, Araṇyakāṇḍa
of Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>“Oh! Rāma! nobody plucks and wears those flowers.
They neither fade nor fall down. While the disciples of
Mataṅga were carrying a load of flowers for him, they
sweated on account of exhaustion and some drops of
sweat fell on earth which developed themselves into
flowers due to the prowess of the guru's tapas. Even
today may be seen there Śabarī, who has taken to
sannyāsa and who tends the flowers. She will attain
heaven only after seeing you.”
<div n="NI"/>Śabarī lived for long there serving Mataṅga's disciples,
performing tapas and learning knowledge about
Brahman. At the time of the munis giving up their
physical bodies they blessed Śabarī that without further
delay she would meet Rāma and get redemption from
the curse. They also blessed that she would possess
divine eyes to see hidden things and also the past and
the future. After that she was spending her days await-
ing the arrival of Rāma.
<div n="NI"/>It was the period of the life in the forest of Rāma and
Lakṣmaṇa. After visiting various āśramas Rāma at
last came to Mataṅgāśrama. Hearing about Rāma's
[Page659-b+ 65]
visit Śabarī had gathered a lot of fruits. Now, Rāma
and Lakṣmaṇa came and Śabarī received them most
respectfully. After herself biting each fruit to test its
taste she gave the fruits for them to eat. The left-overs
of Śabarī appeared as nectar to Rāma. Then Śabarī
told Rāma thus: “When you go a short distance south-
wards there is the beautiful stream called Pampā. You
cross Pampā and advance a little further and you will
reach mount Ṛṣyamūka. On the top of that mountain
lives Sugrīva, son of Sun, and if you enter into alliance
with him you will succeed in finding out and getting
back Sītā after annihilating the enemies. Oh! Lord!
my salutations.”
<div n="NI"/>After speaking thus, Śabarī the great anchorite and
chaste woman closed her eyes. Immediately she was
transformed into Mālinī, the Gandharva damsel, and
all at once a handsome Gandharva prince appeared there
in a divine plane. It was Vītihotra, the husband of
Mālinī. After saluting Śrī Rāma he took away his wife
in a chariot to the Gandharva city. (Kamba Rāmā-
yaṇa, Araṇyakāṇḍa).
