BUDHA I¦. Son of Candra.
<div n="NI"/>1) Birth. Bṛhaspati the teacher-priest of the devas
had a very beautiful wife named Tārā. One day seeing
the handsome figure of Candra, Tārā became amorous.
Candra was the Disciple of Bṛhaspati. It was not right
on the part of the wife of the teacher to feel amorous
towards a disciple. Bṛhaspati came to know of the
affair and sending for Candra asked him to return his
wife. Both Candra and Tārā did not pay any heed to
Bṛhaspati. Both sides were about to engage in a battle.
The devas arrayed themselves on both sides. Seeing
that this was not an honourable thing some devas
tried for a compromise. Finally Candra returned Tārā
to Bṛhaspati. At this time Tārā was pregnant. Both
Candra and Bṛhaspati claimed the paternity of the
child in the womb of Tārā, who witnessed that Candra
[Page165-a+ 65]
was the father of the child. All accepted the words of
Tārā. Budha was the child Tārā gave birth to.
<div n="NI"/>2) {%Marriage and birth of a child.%} Budha grew up to be
a youth. During the period the King Sudyumna one
day entered Kumāravana (a forest) and was changed to
a woman. When the King became a woman the name
adopted was Ilā, who grew amorous of Budha. The
famous King Purūravas was the son born to them.
