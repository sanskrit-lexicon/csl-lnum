DHANAÑJAYA IV¦. A Sanskrit critic who lived during
the period between 11th and 12th century A.D. He was
a member of the court of King Muñja. His important
work is ‘Daśarūpaka’. This work contains three
hundred ślokas divided in four separate divisions. After
the death of Muñja, Dhanika, brother of Dhanañjaya,
wrote a commentary on this work. The treatise is
named ‘Daśarūpāvaloka’. There are several quotations in
this from the Sanskrit dramas ‘Veṇīsaṃhāra’ and ‘Ratnā-
valī’. He has in this work discussed Drama and Poetry
in general giving prominence to the emotional side of it.
The critical work, Daśarūpāvaloka, contains quotations
from a book ‘Kāvyanirṇaya’ by Dhanika himself. But
the work ‘Kāvyanirṇaya’ has not yet been made avail-
able. Even in composing poetry Dhanañjaya was well
versed. He is the author of the well-known epic ‘Rāghava-
pāṇḍavīya’. It is known as ‘Dvisandhāna Kāvya’ also.
This is based on the lives of Pāṇḍavas and Śrī Rāma.

stated by scholars that Rāghavapāṇḍavīya was written
during the period 1123 to 1140 A.D. (History of classi-
cal Sanskrit Literature).
