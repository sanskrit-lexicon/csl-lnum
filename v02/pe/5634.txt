RĀKṢASA I¦. A particular sect of asuras. The ancients
had ordained that Rākṣasas should not be killed at dusk.
Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakāṇḍa, Canto 22, Verse 22).
<div n="NI"/>Uttararāmāyaṇa, contains the following story about the
origin of Rākṣasas. When Brahmā was reciting the
Vedas at the beginning of Kṛtayuga he felt very hungry
and certain forms emanated from his face. Those who
were born from his anger assumed the form of Rā-
kṣasas and those from his hunger that of Yakṣas. The
Rākṣasas turned out to be evil folk killing and eating
cows and brahmins. Praheti and Heti were the
first born Rākṣasas, the latter of whom wedded Bhayā,
daughter of Kāla, and to them was born a son called
Vidyutkeśa. He married Sālakaṭaṅkā, daughter of
Sandhyā. Though a child was born to them they
forsook it in the Himālayan slopes and went their own
way.
<div n="NI"/>At that time Śiva and Pārvatī came that way and after
blessing the child returned to Kailāsa. The child was
named Śukeśa. He married Devavatī, daughter of the
Gandharva called Maṇimaya and three children were
born to the couple, viz. Mālyavān, Sumālī and Mālī.
They did tapas to propitiate Brahmā and when he
appeared requested him thus: “We must defeat Yakṣas
Kinnaras, Gandharvas, Siddhas, Vidyādharas, Yama,
Kubera, Vāsava, Nāga kings and daityas and dānavas
and we must not be defeated by any one. We must
kill all enemies and they shall not kill us. We three
shall never quarrel among ourselves.”
<div n="NI"/>Brahmā granted all their prayers. The three, proud and
haughty due to these boons, began roaming about con-
suming cows and brahmins. They asked Viśvakarmā
to build a city for them and he built for them Laṅkā
on Mount Trikūṭa in the south sea. The three brothers
took their abode in Laṅkā Mālyavān, Sumālī and
Mālī married respectively Sundarī. Ketumatī, and
Vasudhā, daughters of the Gandharva woman Narmadā
Mālyavān begot of Sundarī seven sons called Vajramuṣṭi
Virūpākṣa, Durṃukha, Suptaghna, Yajñakośa, Matta,
and Unmatta, and also a daughter called Nalā.
<div n="NI"/>To Sumālī were born of Ketumatī ten sons and also four
daughters.
<div n="NI"/>Four sons were born to Mālī of his wife Vasudhā, and
they became the ministers of Vibhīṣaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>Then thousands of Rakṣasas were born as sons, grand-
sons, brothers, nephews, etc. to the above and they lived
in Laṅkā, a terror to the whole world.
<div n="NI"/>While the daughters of Sumālī, Vekā, Puṣpotkaṭā,
Kaikasī and Kumbhīnasī were once walking in the
forest they saw Kubera on a visit to Brahmā in all
pomp and glory. They understood that Kubera owed
his pomp and glory to his being the son of Viśravas and
therefore, the next day one of the four, Kaikaśī, went
to Viśravas's āśrama and prayed for children by him.
Three sons called Rāvaṇa, Vibhīṣaṇa and Kumbha-
karṇa and a daughter called Śūrpaṇakhā were born to
her by Viśravas. They secured boons by performing
tapas and Rāvaṇa lived in Laṅkā as king of the
Rākṣasas.
