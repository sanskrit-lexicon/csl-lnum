JĀPAKA¦. A Brāhmaṇa who was constantly engaged in
uttering Gāyatrī. Jāpaka was ordered to go to hell
because certain mistakes were detected in the uttering
of Gāyatrī. But Devī Sāvitrī intervened. She appeared
before him and gave him heaven. This Jāpaka was a
contemporary of Ikṣvāku. (M.B. Śānti Parva, 3
Chapters from 197).
