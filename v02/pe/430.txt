ARIṢṬA¦ (ARIṢṬAKA). An asura, a servant of Kaṃsa.
Once, at the instance of Kaṃsa he went to Gokula
disguised as an ox to kill Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The ox instilled
terror in people by tearing to pieces hills and mountains
[Page048-a+ 65]
with its horns and bellowing like hell. But Śrī Kṛṣṇa
faced the beast, and rained blows on him and it was
thrown hundred yojanas away and it died. At the time
of death it regained its fromer from as Asura. (Bhāga-
vata, Daśama, Skandha, Chapter 37).
