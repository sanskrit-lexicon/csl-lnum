CAṆḌAKA¦. A forest hunter who attained salvation by
the worship of Śivaliṅga. (Phallus of Śiva).
<div n="NI"/>While once hunting in the woods Caṇḍaka saw a Śiva
temple in ruins, and the Śivaliṅga lying on the ground
uncared for. This sight greatly grieved him, and he
told Śiṃhaketu, son of the Pāñcāla Rāja who happened
to come that way all about the temple and the
liṅga. To his query as to whether the śāstra permitted
a hunter like himself to worship Śivaliṅga, Siṃhaketu
answered there were injunctions in the Śāstras for
people like him (Caṇḍakas) to instal Śivaliṅga on
rock and then worship it daily, the worshipper wear-
ing ashes from the burning ghāṭ on his body. Accord-
ingly Caṇḍaka installed the liṅga on a rock and began
worshipping it daily along with his wife, Pulindī. But
after sometime there was left no ashes in the burning
ghāṭ and Caṇḍaka and Pulindī discussed between them
the means to get ashes for the next day. Then Pulindī
suggested that she should burn herself to ashes and that
Caṇḍaka should continue worshipping the Śivaliṅga
wearing on his body the ashes. Very unwillingly
Caṇḍaka agreed with the sad proposal of his wife, and
the next day he worshipped the Śivaliṅga wearing on
his body the ashes of Pulindī. And, at the close of the
worship he called aloud for Pulindī, and lo! wonder
of wonders! she stood there before him more healthy
than formerly. Moreover a vimāna descended from the
skies and conducted both Caṇḍaka and Pulindī to
Śivaloka. (Śiva Purāṇa, Śaṃbaramāhātyma).
