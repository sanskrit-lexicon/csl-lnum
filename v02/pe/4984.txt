PAÑCATĪRTHA¦. A holy place. There is a pond at
this place. Once a nymph called Vargā with her four
companions lived in this pond as crocodiles as a result
of a curse. Arjuna came to that pond and rescued them
from their curse. From that day onwards the pond
came to be known as Pañcatīrtha or Saubhadraka-
tīrtha (For details see under Vargā and Saubhadraka
tīrtha).
