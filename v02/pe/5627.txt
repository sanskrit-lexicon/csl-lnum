RAJI¦ (RĀJI). A prominent king of the Pūru dynasty.
He was one of the five sons of Āyus by Svarbhānu the
other four being Nahuṣa, Kṣatravṛddha, (Vṛddhaśarman)
Rambha and Anenas. (Āśrama Parva, Chapter 70,
Verse 23).
<div n="NI"/>Purāṇas contain stories that Indra destroyed people
born in Raji's dynasty as they hated the former. That side
in which the powerful Raji fought used to win. In a fight
between the asuras and the Devas, when Indra felt that
his side was losing, he secured the participation of Raji
in the fight on condition that the latter would be given
Indra-hood. The asuras were defeated and Raji was
made king of svarga.
<div n="NI"/>Raji had thousands of children and they were known under
the common name Rājeyakṣatriyas. But they were a
foolish lot and lacked the capacity to distinguish them-
selves in Indra's place. Therefore, at the instance of
Bṛhaspati, preceptor of the Devas, Indra destroyed
them all and resumed his former position and status.
(Bhāgavata, 9th Skandha; Vāyu Purāṇa, Chapter 92,
Verse 76; Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa 11; Harivaṃśa 1, 28;
Matsya Purāṇa. Chapter 24, Verses 34-49).
