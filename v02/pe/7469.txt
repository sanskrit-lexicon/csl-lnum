TAKṢAŚILĀ¦. A place of Purāṇic celebrity situated in the
north-west of Bhārata. Even from ancient times this
[Page784-a+ 65]
was an educational and cultural centre. From the des-
criptions of the Chinese traveller Huen Tsang it is found
that Nalandā and Takṣaśilā were two great universities
before Christ. The famous Sarpasatra of Janamejaya
was conducted at this place situated on the banks of
the river Vitastā. The story of Mahābhārata was first
told at this place and at the end of the narration Brah-
mins were given gifts. (Chapters 3 and 5, Ādi Parva).
