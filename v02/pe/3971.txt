LAṄKĀ¦. The kingdom of Rāvaṇa.
<div n="NI"/>1) {%Origin.%} It is believed that the present island of
Ceylon was the Laṅkā of the Purāṇas, the city of
Rāvaṇa. This city of Laṅkā was situated on the top of
the mountain Trikūṭa. This Trikūṭa was a peak
of Mahāmeru. Because of a fight between Vāsuki
and Vāyubhagavān this peak broke away from
Mahāmeru and fell into the ocean. (See Para 5 under
Kubera).
<div n="NI"/>2) {%History.%} Viśvakarmā constructed a magnificent city
on the top of the mountain Trikūṭa for the use of
Kubera. Kubera lived there adored and worshipped by
all. One day Kubera travelled by air in an aeroplane of
his. Kaikasī, mother of Rāvaṇa saw that and she became
jealous. She called her son to her side and said that
at any cost the city of Laṅkā on the mount Trikūṭa
should be captured and given to her. Rāvaṇa along
with his brothers went to the Himālayas and performed
penance there and obtained several boons from Śiva. Then
Rāvaṇa conducted a victory march as an arch-opponen
[Page451-a+ 64]
of all living forces and drove away Kubera from Laṅkā
and took possession of Laṅkā as the place of his abode.
He took along with him all the demons residing in
Pātālaloka.
<div n="NI"/>3). {%The design of Laṅkā.%} Viśvakarmā, the celebrated
architect designed the beautiful Laṅkā and the supreme
building ability of Maya brought into form the enchant-
ing city. On the top of Trikūṭa was the all important
Navaratnaśṛṅga and on a spacious plateau on its top
stood the majestic city of Laṅkā. In the centre was the
ten-storeyed palace of Rāvaṇa and around it in eight
different places stood the nine-storeyed buildings of the
great ministers of Rāvaṇa. The nine edifices were like
the Navagrahas (nine planets) of Laṅkā. Each of the nine
edifices was built with one of the nine gems and the royal
palace in the centre was built by using all the nine gems.
Even the sun avoided passing over these buildings and
changed his path either a bit to the north or to the
south making what is known as the Dakṣiṇāyana and
Uttarāyaṇa. (Yuddha Kāṇḍa, Kamba Rāmāyaṇa).
<div n="NI"/>4). {%No sand in Laṅkā.%} The ancient belief is that there is
no sand in Laṅkā The fourth taraṅga of Kathāmukha-
lambaka of Kathāsaritsāgara gives a story relating to the
reason for this belief.
<div n="NI"/>Garuḍa flew to Devaloka to bring Amṛta (nectar) to
redeem his mother from her servitude to his step-mother.
On his way he took an elephant and tortoise from near
the āśrama of Kaśyapa for his food. He sat on a huge
banyan tree to eat them. On the ground below the
Bālakhilyas were performing penance. The branch on
which Garuḍa sat with his food sagged and before it
broke Garuḍa took away the elephant and tortoise
and deposited them on the mountain Gandhamādana
near the ocean. The branch broke and fell into the ocean
and the city of Laṅkā was built on the branch and that
was why the ancient people believed there was no sand
in Laṅkā.
