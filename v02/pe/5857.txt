RUṢAṄGU¦. An ancient hermit. Once the great
hermit Ārṣṭiṣeṇa came to the hermitage of Ruṣaṅgu and
did severe penance. Viśvāmitra obtained Brāhmaṇatva
(Brahminhood) by doing penance in this place. To-
wards the end of his life Ruṣaṅgu and his sons came to
Pṛthūdakatīrtha and sang laudatory songs about
Pṛthūdakatīrtha. Ruṣaṅgu said that those who did
penance and died in this holy bath would not have to
undergo miseries after death. (M.B. Śalya Parva,
Chapter 39, Stanza 24).
