BĀHU I¦. A king of the Sūrya-vaṃśa (solar dynasty). He
was the father of Sagara. He is known by the name
Subāhu also. This king was once defeated in a battle and
being weary and sad he entered the hermitage of Aurva.
His queen was given poison by another wife of the
King. But the child in her womb did not die. The queen
wanted to jump into the fire in which the body of her
husband was to be burned. But Aurva told her that her
son would become a famous king and that she should
not commit suicide. Thus she desisted from committing
suicide. A son was born to her. As she had been poison-
ed when the child was in her womb the son was given
the name Sagara (with poison). It is said in Mahā-
bhārata, Ādi Parva that this prince became a famous
king later.
