SĀNKHYA¦, {%s.%} (A system of philosophy ascribed to the Muni
Kapila. It asserts duality {#dvEtaM,#} or the co-existence of
two principles in the universe, viz. spirit and matter.
Its doctrines being opposed to the oneness of the Vedas
led to the formation of another school called the Ve-
dānta or Uttara-Mīmānasā system, asserting the opposite
idea of unity {#ekatvaM#} or {#advEtaM,#} and shewing that the end or
aim of the Vedas was to inculcate the oneness of Spirit or
God) {#sAMKyaH, sAMKyadarSanaM;#} ‘with the commentary,’ {#sAMKyakArikA#}.
