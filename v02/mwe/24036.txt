PURĀNA¦, {%s.%} (Sacred and mythological poem, derived from the
same religious system as the Rāmāyana and Mahābhā-
rata. or from the mytho-heroic style of Hindu belief:
being a departure from the purer system of the Vedas
They are eighteen in number, and each one is supposed
to treat of five topics, viz. 1. the creation, 2. the destruc-
tion and renovation of worlds, 3. the genealogy of gods
and heroes, 4. the reign of the Manus, 5. the transac-
[Page644-a+ 51]
tions of their descendants. From this five-fold division,
and from the antiquity of the stories narrated, come the
general names {#purARaM, paYcalakzaRaM#}. The specific titles are
as follows: 1. {#brahmapurARaM#} or {#brAhmapurARaM,#} 2. {#padnapurARaM,#} 3. {#vizRupu-#}
{#rARaM,#} 4. {#SivapurARaM,#} 5. {#BAgavatapurARaM#} or {#BagavatpurARaM,#} 6. {#nAradapurARaM,#}
7. {#mArkaRqapurARaM, mArkaRqeyapurARaM,#} 8. {#agnipurARaM,#} 9. {#BavizyapurARaM,#} 10. {#brahma-#}
{#vEvarttapurARaM,#} 11. {#liNgapurARaM,#} 12. {#varAhapurARaM,#} 13. {#skandapurARaM,#} 14. {#bAma-#}
{#napurARaM,#} 15. {#kUrmmapurARaM,#} 16, {#matsyapurARaM,#} 17. {#gAruqapurARaM,#} 18. {#brahmA-#}
{#RqapurARaM#}. Sometimes a Purāna called the {#vAyupurARaM#} or
{#vAyavIyapurARaM#} is substituted for the {#SivapurARaM,#} and another
called the {#narasiMhapurARaM#} for the {#brahmARqapurARaM#}. These eighteen
mythological works are the repository of the modern
and popular religious creed of the Hindūs. They are
amplifications of the two great heroic and historical
poems or Itihāsa, called Rāmāyana and Mahābhārata,
giving a more connected and definite explanation of the
mythical fictions and historical traditions contained in
those works. They are consequently remarkable for
attributing paramount importance to the two divinities,
Śiva and Vishnu, who, under one form or other, are
almost the sole objects that are made to claim homage.
Each separate Purāna cannot, therefore, be taken as a
guide to Hindū belief as a whole, but rather to some
separate branch of it, in which the worship of either
one of these deities in particular incarnations is en-
couraged in preference to that of the other. The most
celebrated of them all is the fifth in the above list, or
Bhāgavata Purāna, designed for the glorification of Bha-
gavat or Vishnu, in the form of Krishna. This exer-
cises a more direct and powerful influence on the
opinions of the natives of India than any other. The
third, or Vishnu Purāna, translated by Professor Wilson,
is also a work of great celebrity, and conforms most
closely to the definition of Panchalakshanam, {%i. e.%} treat-
ing of five specified topics. There are also eighteen
Upapuranas, or similar poems of inferior sanctity and
different appellations, viz.: 1. {#sanatkumAraM,#} 2. {#nArasiMhaM,#} 3. {#nAra-#}
{#dIyaM,#} 4. {#SivaM,#} 5. {#durvAsasaM,#} 6. {#kApilaM,#} 7. {#mAnavaM,#} 8. {#OSAnasaM,#} 9. {#varuRaM,#}
10. {#kAlikA,#} 11. {#SamBaM,#} 12. {#nandikeSvaraM,#} 13. {#sOraM,#} 14. {#pArASaraM,#}
15. {#AdityaM,#} 16. {#mAheSvaraM,#} 17. {#BAgavataM,#} 18. {#vaSizWaM#}. The collector
and arranger of the Purānas, as well as of the more
ancient Vedas, was a sage named Krishna {#kfzRaH,#} or Dwai-
pāyana {#dvEpAyanaH,#} or Kṛṣnadvaipāyana {#kfzRadvEpAyanaH#}.
The surname of Vyāsa {#vyAsaH#} or ‘Arranger’ (from the
root {#as#} with {#vi,#} meaning to ‘dispose’ or ‘set in order’),
was given to him, and is now used to denote any ex-
pounder of the Vedas or Purānas. His seat is called
{#vyAsAsanaM, vyAsapIWaM#}.
