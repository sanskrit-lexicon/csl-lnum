KRISHNA¦, {%s.%} (The most celebrated form of Vishnu, or rather
identified with Vishnu, as distinct from his ten Avatārs,
or Incarnations. The following particulars of the history
of this very popular deity, whose votaries are still so
numerous in India are given as an introduction to the
enumeration of his various names. Vasudeva, a descendant
of Yadu and Yayāti, had two wives, Rohinī and Devakī.
The latter had eight sons, of whom the eighth was Krishna.
Kansa, a demon, the sister of Devakī, and king of Mathurā,
was informed by the gods that one of these sons would
kill him. He therefore kept Vasudeva and his wife
Devakī in confinement in his palace, and slew their first
six children. The seventh son was Balarāma, who was
saved by being abstracted from the womb of Devakī, and
transferred to that of Rohinī. The eighth was Krishna,
[Page430-b+ 51]
who was born with kin as black as the dark leaves of the
lotus, and with a peculiar mark on his breast: he was
born at midnight, and immediately taken up by Vasudeva,
who, favoured by the gods, was able to elude the vigilance
of the guards, and make his escape through the gates of
Mathurā to the banks of the Yamunā river. Here Sesha,
the many-headed serpent, spread his hoods above the
heads of the father and child, and thus protecting them,
Vasudeva was enabled to cross the stream, and finding a
a cowherd named Nanda, whose wife Yaśodā had just been
delivered of a child, he quietly substituted his own son in
its place, and returned with the child of the cowherd to
the bedside of Devakī. When Kansa found that the infant
Krishna had escaped, he summoned certain demons, his
servants, and gave orders that a search should be
made for the child, and that all male children in whom
were signs of unusual vigour, should be killed. At the
same time he released Vasudeva and his wife, as no
longer endangering his safety. The cowherd Nanda,
with his wife Yaśodā, taking the infant Krishna, and
accompanied by Rohinī and the infant Balarāma, went to
reside at a village called Gokula, or Vraja, where they
settled. Here the female demon Pūtanā tried to destroy
the young Krishna by offering him her breast to suck,
but was killed by the child. Soon the child, with his
playfellow Balarāma, began to be unruly; and one day
his foster-mother passed the folds of a rope round his body
and tied him to a large wooden bowl, but the strength of
the young Krishna enabled him to drag the bowl against
the trunks of two trees, which were uprooted by the shock.
The family of Nanda now removed from Vraja to Vṛndā-
vana, and here Krishna and Balarāma grew up together,
and, roaming about the woods, joined in the sports of the
herdsmen's sons. One day Krishna came to the banks of
the Yamunā, within which was the fearful pool of the
serpent Kāliya. Krishna jumped boldly in. A terrible
combat ensued, in which the divine child was victorious,
and commanded the snake-king to depart from the Yamunā
to the ocean. About the same time Balarāma killed
the demon Dhenuka, who sought to destroy the two boys,
and soon afterwards killed the demon Pralamba, who had
assumed the shape of a young cowherd, that he might
mix in their sports. Not long after, the young Krishna,
who delighted in playing tricks upon his elders, resolved to
rouse the anger of the god Indra, who, according to some,
was his elder brother. He persuaded Nanda to cease
sacrificing to Indra, and to worship the mountain Govard-
hana, which sheltered the shepherds and their cattle. This
they did. but the exasperated Indra would have destroyed
them and their flocks with heavy rain, had not Krishna
lifted up the mountain and sheltered them under it. Indra,
[Page431-a+ 51]
foiled in his revenge, descended from heaven to praise
Krishna, and made him lord over the cattle, Meanwhile
Krishna had grown a beautiful youth, and soon began to
sport with the Gopīs, or shepherdesses, of whom seven or
eight became his wives, and amongst them his favorite,
Rādhā. In this character he is usually represented with
flowing hair and with a flute in his hand, and has been
compared to Apollo accompanied by the muses. In his
pastimes with the shepherdesses he invented a kind of
round dance, called Rāsa or Mandala nrityam, in which he
and Rādhā being in the centre, the attendant Gopīs danced
round them. But the happiness of Krishna was inter-
rupted by his tyrannical uncle Kansa, who sent formidable
demons to destroy him; Arishta, in the form of a bull,
Keśin, in the form of a horse, Kālanemi, and others.
They were all killed by the young Krishna. Kansa then
sent a messenger, named Akrūra, to entice Krishna and
Balarāma to his city Mathurā, under pretext of being
present at some games. They accepted the invitation
and went. At the entrance of the town Krishna killed
Kansa's washerman, who insulted him. Having clothed
himself in the washerman's yellow clothes, he proceeded,
and meeting a crooked woman carrying ointment,
miraculously made her straight by a touch of his hand.
At the games he killed the king's boxer, Chānūra, and
afterwards Kansa himself, and placed Kansa's father,
Ugrasena, upon the throne. He then became the pupil
of Sāndīpani, and, to rescue his son, killed the demon
Panchajana, and, taking the conch shell, formed of his
bones, bore it as his horn. Still living in Mathurā, he was
attacked by a prince named Kālayavana, who advanced
with a large force against the Yadu tribe. Upon this
Krishna built and fortified a city called Dvāraka, in the
province of Guzerat, and thither transferred the inhabi-
tants of Mathurā. One day Krishna went forth unarmed,
and, being pursued by Kālayavana, took refuge in a cavern,
where Muchukunda, king of men, was asleep. Kālaya-
vana, entering the cavern, was reduced to ashes by an
angry glance from the eye of Muchukunda. Krishna
then returned to Dvāraka. Soon after he was accused of
stealing a wonderful jewel called ‘syamantaka,’ in the
possession of a man named Prasena. But the jewel was
really lost by the death of Prasena in a forest, and was
picked up by a lion, who, in his turn, was killed by the
king of the bears, Jāmbavat. The latter took the jewel to
his cavern, where he was found by Krishna, and com-
pelled to restore the gem. At the same time the bear
gave him his daughter Jāmbavatī in marriage. He next
married Satyabhāmā, daughter of Satrājit, and afterward
carried off Rukminī, daughter of Bhīṣmaka. By the
latter he had a son called Pradyumna, who is usually
[Page431-b+ 51]
identified with Kāmadeva, the god of love, and a daughter
named Chārumatī, as well as many other children. Be-
sides these wives he had more than sixteen thousand
others, who bore him a numerous progeny of one hundred
and eighty thousand sons. The other incidents of his life
are thus briefly related. Indra came to Dvāraka, and
reported to Krishna the tyranny of the demon Naraka.
Krishna went to his city, and slew him and another demon
named Mura, who assisted in the defence of the city. He
afterwards ascended to the heaven of Indra, with his wife
Satyabhāmā, and, visiting the gardens of Swarga, was in-
duced by his wife to carry off the Pāṛjāta tree, or cele-
brated tree of Paradise. Sachī, the wife of Indra, excited
her husband to its rescue, and a conflict ensued between
the gods and Krishna, who defeated them, and carried the
tree to Dvāraka. Soon after this, Uṣā, the daughter of
the Daitya Bāna, became enamoured of Aniruddha, son of
Pradyumna and grandson of Krishna, and induced her
father to carry him off. Krishna, Balarāma, and Prad-
yumna, came to his rescue. Siva and Skanda aided Bāna,
but the former was disabled and the latter put to flight;
and Krishna, encountering Bāna, cut off all his arms. After
this, Paundraka, one of the family of Vasudeva, assumed
the insignia and title of Krishna, and was supported by
the king of Benares. Krishna advanced against them,
mounted on his vehicle Garuda, and having destroyed
them, set fire to Benares by the radiance from his chakra
or discus. Lastly, being recalled by the gods to heaven,
he destroyed all his own family the Yādavas. Amongst
them died Balarāma, out of whose mouth, as he expired,
issued the great serpent, Ananta or Sesha, of which he
was an incarnation. Krishna himself was killed by a
chance shot from a hunter, and again became one with the
Universal Spirit. From this summary of the history of
Krishna his various names will become intelligible.
Many of these names, as well as many of his attributes
and peculiarities, are identical with those of Vishnu. {%See%}
