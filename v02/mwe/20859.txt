OF¦, {%prep.%} expressed generally by the genitive case; as, ‘of
me,’ {#mama;#} ‘of him,’ {#tasya;#} ‘of that man,’ {#tasya puruzasya#}. It
is frequently expressed by the crude form of a noun in
the first member of a compound; as, ‘best of all,’ {#sarvvaSrezWaH#}
{#-zWA -zWaM;#} ‘lord of men,’ {#narapatiH#} {%m.;%} ‘made of wood,’ {#kAzWa-#}
{#nirmmitaH -tA -taM#}. When it denotes ‘out of,’ ‘from amongst,’
it is expressed by {#maDyAt#} or {#maDye,#} affixed to the gen. c., or
crude form; as, ‘of all men,’ {#sarvvapuruzamaDyAt#} or {#sarvvapuruzARAM#}
{#maDyAt#} or {#maDye#}. It may sometimes be rendered by the
abl. c., in phrases where ‘from’ may be substituted in
English; as, ‘of a child, or from childhood,’ {#bAlyAt;#} ‘of
a race of kings, or descended from a race of kings,’ {#rAja-#}
{#kulAt prasUtaH#} or {#rAjakulaprasUtaH#}. It may even be rendered
by the instr. c., in phrases where ‘by’ may be substituted
in English; as, ‘hospitably entertained of the king,’ {%i. e.%}
‘by the king,’ {#rAjYA satkftaH#}. Where ‘of’ denotes ‘property,’
‘possession,’ ‘connexion with,’ ‘belonging to,’ &c., it may
either be expressed by the use of such words as {#sambanDI#}
{#-nDinI#} &c., {#vizayaH -yA -yaM, vizayakaH#} &c., or by the gen. case, as
in some of the foregoing examples. Very frequently an
adjective compound involves some of these senses of the
preposition; as, ‘a bird of a red color,’ {#raktavarRaH pakzI;#} ‘a man
of great valor,’ {#mahAvIryyaH puruzaH;#} ‘a woman of great wealth,’
{#mahADanA strI#}. For the other senses of this preposition,
{%see%} ‘by,’ ‘from,’ ‘out,’ ‘among.’ ‘Of late,’ {#arvAk, arvAkkAle,#}
{#nUtanakAle;#} ‘of old,’ {#purA, purastAt, pUrvvaM, prAkkAle;#} ‘son of a
grandson,’ {#prapOtraH;#} ‘pupil of a pupil,’ {#praSizyaH,#}
