IN¦, {%prep.%} {#ni#} prefixed to roots may give the sense of ‘in;’ as,
‘to enter in,’ {#niviS;#} ‘to dwell in,’ {#nivas#}. When ‘in’
is used for ‘within,’ or ‘in the midst,’ it may be expressed
by {#antar, antarA, antare, maDye#}. But the most frequent use
of ‘in’ is expressed in Sanskrit by the locative case,
without any preposition; as, ‘in the city,’ {#nagare;#} ‘in the
night,’ {#rAtrO;#} ‘a tree planted in the earth,’ {#pfTivyAM ropito#}
{#vfkzaH;#} ‘confidence in you,’ {#tvayi viSvAsaH;#} ‘engaging in the
acquisition of wealth,’ {#arTArjane pravfttiH#} {%f.;%} ‘the sun in the
east,’ {#prAci sUryyaH;#} ‘he sinks in the mud,’ {#paNke majjati;#} ‘he
delights in the good of others,’ {#parahite ramate;#} ‘in the front
of the fight,’ {#raRamUrdDi#}. In cases where ‘in’ refers to any
division of time, or the manner in which any thing is
done, it is usually expressed in Sanskrit by the instr.
case; as, ‘in three years,’ {#triBir varzEH;#} ‘in twelve months,’
{#dvAdaSaBir mAsEH;#} ‘in hundreds of years,’ {#varzaSatEH;#} ‘in an
instant,’ {#kzaRena;#} ‘in process of time,’ {#kAlaparyyAyeRa;#} ‘in
how long time?’ {#kiyatA kAlena;#} ‘in a short time,’ {#acireRa;#}
‘in this manner,’ {#anena prakAreRa;#} ‘in abundance,’ {#bAhulyena;#}
‘in the form of a man,’ {#nararUpeRa;#} ‘in joke,’ {#parihAsena;#}
‘written in Sanskrit,’ {#saMskftena racitaM#}. Certain adverbial
affixes and prefixes may often express ‘in;’ as, ‘in front,’
{#agratas;#} ‘in the first place,’ {#praTamatas;#} ‘in another place,’
{#anyatra;#} ‘in one place,’ {#ekatra;#} ‘in many places,’ {#bahutra;#} ‘in
the next world,’ {#amutra;#} ‘in every way,’ {#sarvvaTA;#} ‘in ano-
ther way,’ {#anyaTA;#} ‘in one way,’ {#ekaDA;#} ‘in a hundred
ways,’ {#SataDA;#} ‘in many ways,’ {#bahuDA;#} ‘in some way,’
[Page371-a+ 51]
{#kaTaYcit, kaTaYcana;#} ‘in small quantities,’ {#alpaSas;#} ‘in large
quantities,’ {#bahuSas;#} ‘in proper order,’ {#kramaSas, kramatas,#}
{#anukramaM;#} ‘in every direction,’ {#pratideSaM;#} ‘in three direc-
tions,’ {#treDA;#} ‘in like manner,’ {#taTEva, tadvat;#} ‘in vain,’
{#vfTA, muDA#}. Sometimes ‘in’ may be expressed by a par-
ticiple; as, ‘he has pleasure in calumniating others,’
{#anyAn parivadan sa tupyati#} or {#parABiSaMsanaM kftvA tuzwo Bavati;#} ‘what
bravery is there in killing a sleeping man?’ {#kiM pOruzaM hatvA#}
{#suptaM;#} ‘he said that to me in joke,’ {#upahasya mAm tad avadat#}.
The sense of ‘in,’ may be inherent in a noun; as, ‘to
go in and out,’ {#gamanAgamane kf#}. ‘In as much as,’ is ex-
pressed by {#yasmAt, yena,#} or by the abl. or instr. case of the
abstract noun; as, ‘in as much as it is founded on
observation,’ {#pratyakzamUlatvAt#} or {#pratyakzamUlatayA#}.
