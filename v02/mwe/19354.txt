MILLION¦, {%s.%} {#niyutaH -taM, prayutaH -taM, daSalakzaM;#} ‘ten million,’ {#kowiH#} {%f.;%}
‘one hundred million,’ {#arbudaH;#} ‘one thousand million,’
{#mahArbudaH, mahASaNKaH;#} ‘ten thousand million,’ {#padmaM;#} ‘one hundred
thousand million,’ {#mahApadmaM#} {%m.;%} ‘million million,’ {#abjaM, svarbaM,#}
{#nisvarbaM;#} ‘ten million million,’ {#mahAsvarbaM#}. According to Wil-
son's Dictionary, {#svarbaM#} is equivalent to ten million million,
according to the Mahrattī Dictionary to ten thousand
million, and {#niKarbaM#} to a hundred thousand million:
{#niyutaH#} is also used for one hundred thousand, and
there seems to be much uncertainty in the use of some
others of the above Sanskrit terms. The word {#kowiH#}
is used generally for a large number, and hence the
expression ‘by millions’ {#kowiSas#}
