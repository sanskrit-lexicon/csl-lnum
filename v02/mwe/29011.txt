SYLLOGISM¦, {%s.%} {#nyAyaH, avayavI#} {%m.%} {#(n), avayavaGawitavAkyaM, avayavayukta-#}
{#vAkyaM, avayavopetavAkyaM, AnupUrvvaM#}. A syllogism has five mem-
bers or {#avayavAH,#} according to the Nyāya system, viz.
1. The proposition or assertion to be proved, {#pratijYA;#} 2. the
reason given, {#hetuH;#} 3. the example or illustration, {#udAharaRaM;#}
4. the application, {#upanayaH;#} 5. the conclusion, {#nigamanaM#}. Thus,
1. ‘The hill is fiery,’ {#parvvato vahnimAn#}. 2. ‘Because it smokes,’
{#DUmavattvAt#}. 3. ‘Whatever smokes is fiery, like a culinary
hearth,’ {#yo yo DUmavAn sa vahnimAn yaTA mahAnasaH#}. 4. ‘This (hill)
has smoke which is always accompanied with fire,’ {#vahni-#}
{#vyApyaDUmavAn ayaM#}. 5. ‘Therefore it is fiery,’ {#tasmAd vahnimAn#}.
According to the Mīmānsā school, a syllogism has only
the last three members.
