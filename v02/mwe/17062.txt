KĀMADEVA¦, {%s.%} (The god of love or Hindu Cupid, son of Vishnu
or Krishna by Lakṣmī, who is then called Māyā or
Rukminī. According to another account he was first
produced in the heart of Brahmā, and coming out in
the form of a beautiful female, was looked upon by Brah-
mā with amorous emotions. He is usually represented
as a handsome youth, sometimes riding on a parrot,
and attended by nymphs, one of whom bears his banner,
which consists of a fish on a red ground. Endeavouring
to influence Śiva with the passion of love for his wife
Pārvatī, he discharged an arrow at him; but Śiva, enraged
at the attempt, reduced him to ashes, or as some say, to
a mere mental essence, by a beam of fire darted from
his central eye. Afterwards the relenting god declared
that he should be born again in the form of Pradyumna,
son of Krishna by Māyā or Rukminī. The bow of
Kāmadeva is made of flowers, with a string formed of
bees, and his five arrows are each tipped with the blos-
som of a flower which is devoted to, and supposed to
preside over, a sense. He is lord of the Apsarasas. As
god of desire he is called) {#kAmaH, kAmadevaH, kamanaH, ramaH -maRaH,#}
