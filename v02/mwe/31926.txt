BALARĀMA¦. This god is not often regarded as an avatār of
Vishnu, but rather as an incarnation of the great ser-
pent Ananta; hence he is sometimes called {#SezaH#} or {#anantaH#}.
He was the son of Vasudeva by Devakī, but was trans-
ferred from the latter to the womb of Rohiṇī, the other
wife of Vasudeva, and hence his name, {#saNkarzaRaH#}. Other

of the boxer Muṣṭika) {#muzwikAntakaH#}. — (Secret in motion)
