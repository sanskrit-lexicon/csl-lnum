the word ‘lest’ it will be necessary to vary the form
of the sentence according to the particle employed, as
in the following examples selected from modern Sanskrit.
‘I fear lest your minds should be corrupted,’ {#ced yuzmAkaM#}
{#manAMsi duzyeyur mamEzA BItir jAyate;#} ‘beware lest he strike
thee,’ {#sAvaDAno Bava cet tvAmapi tAqayati;#} or the particle may
be omitted; as, ‘beware lest any man deceive you,’
{#sAvaDAnA Bavata ko'pi yupmAn na Bramayet:#} or other particles may
be used in more classical Sanskrit, the construction of
the sentence being changed accordingly; as, ‘commit
not evil lest thou obtain the same,’ {#pApaM mA kuru pApe hi kfte#}
{#tvayA tAdfSaM prAptavyaM;#} ‘he commanded to kill the captives lest
they should escape,’ {#vandayaH palAyizyante ityASaNkayA#} or {#iti budDyA#}
{#tAn hantum AdideSa;#} ‘justice is not to be killed, lest being
killed, it destroy us,’ {#Darmmo na hantavyo mA no Darmmo hato baDIt#}.
