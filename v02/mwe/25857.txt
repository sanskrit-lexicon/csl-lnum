SACRAMENT¦, {%s.%} {#saMskAraH, mahAyajYaH#}. For the twelve sanskāras or
sacred symbolical rites, {%see%} RITE. The following are the
five mahā-yajnas, or great sacraments of the Hindūs (as
explained in Manu III. 70. {%et. seq.%}), appointed to be per-
formed every day by the Grihastha, or house-keeper, for
the sake of expiating the sin incurred by the involuntary
destruction of minute living creatures. They refer re-
spectively to what is due to five objects, viz. himself,
the gods, his fore-fathers, spirits or ghosts, and men or
guests. 1. Study of Scripture, with prayer and medita-
tion, called {#brahmayajYaH#} or {#ahutaH#}. 2. Offering oblations to
the gods in fire, called {#devayajYaH#} or {#hutaH#}. 3. Offering libations
of water and cakes to the manes of deceased ancestors,
called {#pitfyajYaH#} or {#prASitaM#} or {#SrAdDaM#}. 4. Casting the residue
of oblations on the ground or in water, as an offering
to spirits or goblins, called {#BUtayajYaH#} or {#baliyajYaH#} or {#prahutaH#} or
{#AhutaH#} or {#baliH#} {%m.%} 5. Receiving guests, and especially
Brahmans, with hospitality, called {#nfyajYaH#} or {#manuppayajYaH#} or
{#brAhmyahutaM#} or {#brAhmyaM#} or {#brahmahutaM#}. The Viṣnu-Purāna adds two
other sacraments, viz. ‘propagation of offspring,’ {#prajApatiyajYaH,#}
and ‘observance of truth,’ {#satyayajYaH,#} but these are com-
paratively modern additions. The Christian idea of a sa-
crament may be expressed by {#saMskAraH#} or {#KrIzwaprakalpitasaMskAraH;#}
as, ‘the sacrament of baptism,’ {#jalasaMskAraH#} or {#jalasecanasaMskAraH#}
or {#majjanasaMskAraH;#} ‘of the Lord's Supper,’ {#KrIzwaBojanasaMskAraH#}
or {#KrIzwamfnyuramaraRArTakasaMskAraH#}.
