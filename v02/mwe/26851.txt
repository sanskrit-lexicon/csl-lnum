SHĀSTRA¦, SHĀSTER, {%s.%} A term applied to scientific or philo-
sophical treatises and books of law. There are properly
only six Ṣāstras, comprising the five philosophical sys-
tems ({%see%} SCHOOL), and the code of legal institutes; viz.
1. {#mImAMsASAstraM#} or {#pUrvvamImAMsASAstraM,#} 2. {#sAMKyaSAstraM,#} 3. {#vedAntaSAstraM,#}
4. {#nyAyaSAstraM,#} including under it the {#vESezikaSAstraM,#} 5. {#yogaSAstraM,#}
6. {#DarmmaSAstraM#}. The last includes the celebrated code of
Manu or {#mAnavaDarmmaSAstraM#}. The term Ṣāstra is also applied
to less important branches of literature, and when used in
the singular number denotes the body of all that has
been written on each subject; as, ‘Treatises on rhetoric,’
{#alaNkAraSAstraM;#} ‘poetical works,’ {#kAvyaSAstraM;#} ‘Treatises on
the mechanical arts,’ {#SilpiSAstraM#}.
