RE¦. This prefix is expressed in Sanskrit by {#punar#} or {#prati,#} by
the former when ‘re’ signifies again, as in the verbs,
‘re-absorb,’ ‘re-appear;’ by the latter when it signifies
back, as in the verbs, ‘re-demand,’ ‘repay.’ In cases
where the word formed with ‘re’ is not given in this
Dictionary, the student must take the simple verb or
noun, and use the above prefixes.
