the relations of the deceased soon after his death, and
are repeated once, or, according to some, twice in every
year, {%i. e.%} on the anniversary of the death, and on the
same lunar day of the waning half of the month Bhādra.
The latter are called {#mahAlayaH#}. These obsequial rites
are supposed to be necessary to secure the residence of
the souls of the deceased in a world appropriated to
the manes.
