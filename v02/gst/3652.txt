{#anEkAntika#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-kaH-kA-kam#}) (In Philosophy.)
Indeterminate, going astray, non-absolute.--In the Nyāya
and Vaiśeṣika philosophies a quality which constitutes one
of the five {#hetvABAsa#} (q. v.) or semblances of reason; in the
Nyāya it is also called {#savyaBicAra#}. A ‘semblance of reason’
‘goes astray’ or is ‘indeterminate’, if the argument is either
too general ({#sADAraRa#}) i. e. if it may be applied to the sub-
ject of conclusion and to an opposite one; e. g. ‘sound is
eternal, because it is not the object of touch’ or ‘the hearth
smokes, because it is fiery’; or not general enough ({#asA-#}
{#DAraRa#}) i. e. if it is excluded from either; e. g. ‘sound is
eternal because it has the properties of sound’; or non-ex-
clusive ({#anupasaMhArin#}) i. e. if the major may be predicated
of any other notion; e. g. ‘every thing is eternal because
it can be measured’ or ‘every thing can be named because
it can be inferred’. E. {#a#} neg. and {#EkAntika#}.
