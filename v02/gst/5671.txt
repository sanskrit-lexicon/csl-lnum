{#apsukzit#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-t#}) (ved.) Residing in the intermediate
region, in the region between heaven and earth, viz. the
eleven gods which form one class, besides the class of eleven
gods which reside in heaven, and another class of eleven
gods which reside over the earth. (An interpretation ‘re-
siding in the waters’ has been applied to these gods pro-
bably in order to suggest what Hindu mythology {%ought%} to
have been, but it is neither countenanced by Sāyaṇa nor
by Mahīdh. nor by any other authority.) E. {#apsu#} (loc. of
{#ap#} 2.) and {#kzit#}.
