[{#anyaka#}.¦ N. B. The forms {#anyake, anyakezAm#} are not to be re-
ferred to a base {#anyaka,#} but belong to {#anya#} q. v. which word
like other {#sarvanAman#} q. v. may assume the affix {#akac#} placed
before the endings. Such is the theory of Pāṇini, and it is
countenanced not only by the pronominal declension endings
of {#anyake#} &c. but by the analogy of a similar intrusion of
{#ka#} in the middle of verbal forms such as {#BindDaki, CindDaki#}
‘he cuts badly or a little’.]
