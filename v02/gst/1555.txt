{#aTarya#}¦ m. ({#-ryaH#}) Moving constantly; an epithet of Agni in the
Vedas. See also the following. E. {#aTary,#} kṛt aff. {#ac(?)#}.
A commentary explains, that {#aTarya#} is an epithet of {#dakzi-#}
{#RAgni,#} because the sacred fire ‘goes always’ from the Gār-
hapatya (q. v.) to his proper place; the epithet may be con-
sidered, however, as one of a more general bearing.
