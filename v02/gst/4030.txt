{#and(adi-BvAdi-udAtta-udAttet)#}¦ r. 1st cl. par. ({#andati-#}
{#anAt-Ananda;#} see {#ant#}) To bind. (The Draviḍa pro-
vincialism of this radical is {#ant#} q. v. Comp. also {#Int#}.
The real occurence of this radical which is inflected in the
Dhātuparāyaṇa of Hemachandra, as far as the forms given
are concerned, but not in the Dhātuvṛtti of Mādhava who
inflects {#ant#} q. v., is very doubtful. See the Preface.)
