{#anuzwuB#}¦ Tatpur. f. ({#-zwup#}) <sup>1</sup> Speech, in general. <sup>2</sup> A name of
[Page106-b+ 56]
Sarasvatī. <sup>3</sup> The name of a class of metres which consists
of 32 syllables and, in the Vedas, is regulated by the number
of syllables only, in classical poetry by number and quantity.
In the Vedas the 32 syllables are distributed either in Te-
trastichs of 8 syllables in each line, or in Triplets of either
12 + 8 + 12 or 12 + 12 + 8 or 8 + 12 + 12 syllables. For the
varieties of the Anuṣṭubh in the classical poetry see {#citra-#}
{#padA, vidyunmAlA, mARavaka#} or {#mARavakAkrIqA, haMsaruta, pramA-#}
{#RikA#} or {#nagasvarUpiRI#} or {#matallikA, samAnikA#} or {#mallikA,#}
{#vitAna, tuNgA, kamala, haMsapadI, mAtaNgI, ramBA#} and the metre
which is most in use but the quantity of which is not so in-
variable as that of the named varieties viz. the {#Sloka#}. In a
vaidik hymn the Anuṣṭubh is represented as one of the
primitive creations, that originated together with the moon;
according to some Purāṇas it was created from the northern
mouth of the four-headed Brahman (m.) together with the
Atharvaveda, a portion of the Sāmaveda and some hymns
as well as the Āptoryāma portion of the Jyotiṣṭoma sacri-
fice; accord. to another Purāṇa from the tendons of Brahman.
(The Kāsikā considers the vaidik {#anuzwyA#} equivalent to the
classical instrum. {#anuzwuBA;#} but {#anuzwyA#} is probably an er-
roneous reading for {#anuzwyA#} q. v.) E. {#stuB#} with {#anu,#} kṛt
aff. {#kvip,#} so called according to the Nirukta ‘because it
follows in praise ({#anuzwoBati#}) with its fourth Pāda the Gā-
yatrī metre which consists only of three Pādas or stanzas’.
