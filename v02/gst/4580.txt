{#apatya#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-tyam#}) Offspring in general, whether male or
female ({#‘apatyABiDAne strIpuM~lliNgasyAprasidDirnapuMsakatvAt’#});
whether sons or the later generations of a Gotra ({#‘putrapa-#}
{#ryAyo'patyaSabdaH . pOtrapraBftO tu gORa iti BAvaH’;#} or {#‘a-#}
{#patyaM pOtrapraBftigotramiti sUtrakAreRa sAmAnADikaraRyena nirdeSaH#}
{#kftaH’#}); e. g. {#ftvikpurohitApatyaBAryAdAsasanABiBiH . vi-#}
{#vAdaM varjayitvA tu sarvAM~llokAnjayedgfhI;#} but sometimes the
word means only ‘the children’ ({#‘apatyADikArAdanyatra lO-#}
{#kikaM gotraM gfhyate . apatyamAtraM na tu pOtrapraBftyeva’#} as the {%Kā-%}
{%śikā%} observes on {%Pāṇ.%} IV. 2. 39).--Compare {#gotra, vfdDa#} and
{#yuvan#}. [In the passage of the {%Amarak.%} {#‘strIpuMsayorapatyAntAH’#}
i. e. ‘patronymics are masculines and feminines’, {#apatya#} im-
plies ‘a patronymical affix’; comm.: {#‘apatyArTe vihitA ye#}
{#'RRAdayastadantAH’#}.] E. According to the native etym. {#a#} neg.
and {#patya#} ({#pat,#} kṛtya aff. {#yat#}) ‘the family being preserved
by them from decay’; it has been proposed to derive this
word from {#apa,#} taddh. aff. {#tyap,#} which E. is plausible from a
grammatical point of view; but the native E. is countenanced
by the words {#napAt#} and {#naptf#} qq. vv. which convey a notion
similar to that of {#apatya#}.
