{#anyAdfkza#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-kzaH-kzA-kzam#}) The same as {#anyA-#}
{#dfS#}. [This word is given on the authority of the Siddhānta
Kaum. fol. 181 a. 1. 14. ed. Calc. and on that of Durgādāsa's
comm. on Vopadeva 26. 83. 85; it is not mentioned, however,
in the commentaries of the Dhātupāṭhas, nor by the author
of the Kāśikā who in his gloss on a Vārttika to Pāṇ. III.
2. 60. gives only the words: {#tAdfkza, yAdfkza, Idfkza#} and {#kIdfkza;#}
Patanjali and his commentators do not even speak of the
Vārttika on which the Kāś. has founded {#tAdfkza#} &c., the
only word of a similar formation, viz. {#sadfkza,#} being men-
tioned by Patanjali in his gloss on a Vārtt. to Pāṇ. VI.
3. 89. It will appear therefore, that {#anyAdfkza#} does not belong
to the older period of the classical Sanskṛt.] E. {#anya#} and {#dfkza#}
({#dfS,#} kṛt aff. {#ksa#}) with the prolongation of the middle vowel.
