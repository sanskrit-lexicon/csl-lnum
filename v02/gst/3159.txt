ful, at least as regards its etymol. interpretation; acc. to
some it would be qualified as {#muKyAnuyAyin#} ‘following the
chief i. e. the father &c. at the marriage ceremony &c.; the
instance given however would not seem to countenance the
meaning viz. {#bAlakAnubanDena yAtrABaNgo mA BUt#} ‘let the festival
not be disturbed by the incumbrance of children’; accord.
to others the meaning ‘child’ would imply the tie of af-
fection). <sup>8</sup> (In the system of the native grammarians.) An
indicatory letter which is annexed to radicals ({#DAtu#}), no-
minal bases ({#prAtipadika#}), affixes ({#pratyaya#}), particles ({#nipAta#}),
inserted letters ({#Agama#}) and substitutes ({#AdeSa#}), to mark
some peculiarity in the accent, inflection or derivation; for
instance an {%indicatory%} {#i#} denotes that verbs require the in-
sertion of a nasal before their final consonant; the anu-
bandha may be a vowel (in this case it is {#anunAsika#} q. v.
in the system of Pāṇini) or a consonant. Being a mere
technical element it cannot occur in real language. Instances
of anubandhas may be gathered from the etymologies in this
