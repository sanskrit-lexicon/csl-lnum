{#anukarzan#}Â¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-rzA#}) The bottom of a carriage. See {#anukarza#}.
E. Probably a further developement of the partic. {#anukarzat,#}
from {#kfz#} with {#anu,#} conformably to the general origin of bases
in {#an;#} the native dict. consider it as {#anukarza#} with an additional
{#n,#} but {#anukarza#} is more likely the curtailed {#anukarzan#} as most
bases in {#a#} probably originate in a fuller form on {#as, at, an#}.
