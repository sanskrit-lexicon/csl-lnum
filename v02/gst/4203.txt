{#anyatama#}¦ m. f. n. ({#-maH-mA-mam#}) Any one of many, either of
many; e. g. {#vAtapittaSlezmaSoRitamedomUtrAntranimittAH sapta#}
{#vfdDayaH . tAsAM mUtrAntranimitte vfdDI vAtasamutTe kevalamutpattihe-#}
{#turanyatamaH;#} or in the dual, e. g. {#BujakowikarRAnAmanyatame jYAte#}
{#'nyatamayorjYAnAya karaRasUtram;#} in the plur., e. g. {#tAsAmanya-#}
{#tamAH#} (scil. {#rAkzasyaH#}) {#kzipraM rAvaRAyAcacakzire#}. Also ‘any’
in general; e. g. {#hInamanyatamenApyavayavena nyUnam#}. Comp. {#anya-#}
{#tara#}. [According to Vopadeva (7. 96.) {#anyatama#} is formed with
the taddh. aff. {#qatama#} and would therefore be a pronoun,
according to his rule 3. 9., which again would assimilate
its declension to that of {#sarva#} (cf. 3. 35-37. 75); but as there
is no evidence to this effect in Pāṇini or in the literature,
and as Vopad. himself mentions {#anyatara#} in the rule 3. 9., the
word {#anya#} in the rule 7. 96. must be an inaccuracy of this gram-
marian, the correctness of the reading being placed beyond
doubt by the comm. of Durgādāsa.] E. {#anya,#} taddh. aff. {#tamap#}.
