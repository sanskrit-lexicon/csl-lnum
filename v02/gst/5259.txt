{#pUrvam#} (comp. also the {%Vārtt.%} 5. to VIII. 1. 72. and the {%Kāśikā%}
to VIII. 1. 49. (50.)). <sup>2</sup> Not having existed before; e. g. in the
{%Anuśāsana Parvan:%} {#apUrvaM ca BavetpAtramaTavApi cirozitaH#} &c.
({%Nīlakanṭha:%} {#apUrvaH kadAcinnAgato na dfzwaSca#}); new (also
applied to a religious act which does not follow as a con-
sequence of other acts, but requires a special injunction);

<div n="P">2. n. ({#-rvam#}) <sup>1</sup> (In the Mīmānsā philosophy.) <sup>a.</sup> The
{%unseen or transcendental power%} (<lang n="greek">δυναμις</lang>, = {#adfzwapUrvam#} or
{#atyantamadfzwam#} liter. which has not been seen before or
which is very invisible) of a {%religious or sacrificial%} act which
produces the desired result at another than the present or
at a distant time ({%Kumārila:%} {#PalAya vihitaM karma kzaRikaM ci-#}
{#raBAvine . tatsidDirnAnyaTetyevamapUrvamapi gamyate;#} {%Mādhava:%}
{#DAtvarTAtiriktaM kAlAntaraBAvi kAmyaPalasADanam;#} {%the same:%}
{#yAgajanyA kAcicCaktirapUrvamastu#}); if a religious act includes
one or several other acts, the unseen power which results
from the performance of the latter and which consists in
producing their relation with the former, is called {#avAnta-#}
{#rApUrva,#} while the unseen power of the superior act is called
with regard to the inferior acts {#paramApUrva#} or {#muKyApUrva#} or
{#prakftApUrva#} or {#praDAnApUrva#}. That unseen power which is only
the result of performing the principal sacrifices, such as
the Jyotiṣṭoma or the Darśapūrṇamāsa, and which con-
sists in producing {%the%} result, i. e. {%swarga%} or the enjoyment
of heaven, is called {#PalApUrva#}. Since such acts include other
acts which vary in degree or importance, there are various
degrees of the {#apUrva#} with regard to the {#PalApUrva,#} viz. the
{#samudAyApUrva,#} the {#utpattyapUrva#} and the {#aNgApUrva#} (the latter also
called {#kalApUrva#}); thus, as the Darśapūrṇamāsa, the perfor-
mance of which has the power of producing heaven, i. e.
the {#PalApUrva,#} consists of the two distinct sacrifices Darśa
and Pūrṇamāsa which are performed at distinct times, it
requires an unseen power to effectuate their combining so
as to constitute the sacrifice Darśapūrnamāsa, (for other-
wise neither of both would have a relation to the other or
to that sacrifice itself); this unseen power is the {#samudAyA-#}
{#pUrva;#} likewise the {#utpattyapUrva#} causes the six Yāgas ({#Agneya-#}
{#puroqASayAgaH, EndrapayoyAgaH, EndradaDiyAgaH#} which con-
stitute the Darśa, and the {#AgneyapuroqASayAgaH, Ajyeno-#}
{#pAMSuyAjayAgaH, agnIzomIyapuroqASayAgaH#} which constitute
the Pūrṇamāsa, and are performed, too, at different
times,) to combine so as to become severally the Darśa
and the Pūrṇamāsa; and lastly, as each of these six
Yāgas comprises again a number of inferior acts, such
as the beating of the {%vrīhi,%} the grinding of the {%taṇḍula,%}
[Page199-a+ 56]
the cleansing of the ladles &c., which also are done at
different times, it requires an {#aNgApUrva#} (or {#kalApUrva#}) to
produce the result of their constituting severally each of
these Yāgas.--Such an unseen power might be predi-
cated, indeed, of any act, whether sacrificial or not,
but the term {#apUrva#} is expressly reserved by the Mīmān-
sists to the former ({%Kumārila:%} {#lOkikaM cApi yatkarma Pale#}
{#kAlAntarodgatO . tatrApi SaktirevAste na tvapUrvagirocyate#}), for
the corresponding power of a non-sacrificial or profane act is
called {#saMskAra#}. ({%Kumārila:%} {#yAnyapi ca lOkikAni kfziGf-#}
{#tapAnAdDyayanapraBftIni karmARi kAlAntaraPalatvenezyante tezAmapi#}
{#svarUpAvasTAnAsaMBavAtsaMskArEreva tizWadBirvyavahArasidDaH . te#}
{#tvavEdikatvAtsaMskArA na tvapUrvaSabdABiDeyatvena prasidDAH;#} comp.
also e. g. {%Mādhava%} in the Pūrvapakṣa of an Adhikaraṇa:
{#yo'yaM svizwakfdyAgaH so'yamupayuktahaviHsaMskAra ityavivAdam .#}
{#tatra saMskArasya dfzwaprayojanatvenAvaSayaMBAve sati tAvatEvopakzI-#}
{#RaH svizwakfdyAgo nApUrvasyopakaroti#} &c.) A doubt may arise,
whether the beating of rice and such like acts have an
{#apUrva,#} if considered absolutely or by themselves, since their
result is the unhusking of the rice and since they are per-
formed for sacrificial purposes, but the Mīmānsists decide
the question in the negative, as it is the characteristic
property of the {#apUrva#} to be an {%unseen%} power, and the un-
husking of rice is a {%visible%} result ({%Mādhava:%} {#dfzwaPale saMBa-#}
{#vatyapUrvaM na kalpanIyam#}); again whether the cleaning of the
sacrificial ladles with kuśa grass and such like acts have an
{#apUrva,#} for their result might be said not to be visible; but the
solution is the same although from a different reason; viz. be-
cause they are undertaken for the sake of the {#dravya,#} i. e. these
inferior acts have an {#apUrva#} only in so far as it concerns
their relation to the superior acts, but not in so far as the
mere material result (of unhusking, the purity of the ves-
sels &c.) is concerned; ({%Jaimini:%} {#tAni#} [scil. {#karmARi#}] {#dvEDaM#}
{#guRapraDAnaBUtAni . yErdravyaM na cikIrzyate tAni praDAnaBUtAni#}
{#dravyasya guRaBUtatvAt#}--such as the Prayājas, when the con-
sideration of the {#dravya#} is subordinate to the superior object
of the sacrifice--{#. yEstu dravyaM cikIrzyate guRastatra pratIyeta dra-#}
{#vyapraDAnatvAt#}--as would be the case with the acts named
before or with the paring of a sacrificial post, when the
act is merely done for the sake of preparing a post &c.).
As the {#apUrva#} produces {%the%} result (swarga), it follows more-
over, that it is not the divinity of the sacrifice who pro-
duces the result or influences the peculiar nature of the
sacrifice, the latter being the consequence of the {#apUrva#} it-
self, ({%Mādhava:%} {#kiM devatAyAH PalapradatvalakzaRaM prADAnyaM Sa-#}
{#bdAdApAdyate . vastusAmarTyAdvA . nAdyaH#} &c. {#….. nApi vastu-#}
{#sAmarTyAddevasya Palapradatvam .…tasmAtPalapradamapUrvameva#}
{#DarmARAM prayojakam . taTA satyagnyAdidevABAve'pyapUrvaprayukta-#}
{#DarmARAmatideSAdasti tatrohasyAvakASaH#}); and that the sacri-
fice itself is not the chief object, since it, too, has not the
(immediate) power of producing the result ({%Mādhava:%} {#a-#}
{#pUrvaM muKyam . PalavattvAt . yajirna muKyaH . PalarahitatvAt#}).--
A discussion (interesting on account of the questions of
philosophy of grammar implied by it) is raised by the Mī-
mānsā writers, viz. whether many words or a single word
of a sentence and, again, in the latter case which word
[Page199-b+ 56]
and which part of such a word will convey the notion of
the {#apUrva#}. The question is decided in this way: in vaidik
passages, enjoining an act which possesses the unseen
power, such as {#somena yajeta,#} or {#hiraRyamAtreyAya dadAti,#}
or {#tasmAtsuvarRaM hiraRyaM BAryam,#} or {#SyenenABicaranyajeta,#} or
{#citrayA yajeta paSukAmaH,#} not all the words of the sentence
collectively convey the {#apUrva,#} nor a single word expressing
the substance ({#dravya#}) of the sacrificial act, as {#soma#} and {#hi-#}
{#raRya,#} nor the word expressing a quality ({#guRa#}), as {#suvarRa,#}
nor the word expressing the name ({#karmavAci#}) of the sacri-
fice, as {#Syena#} and {#citrA,#} but the {%inflected verb%} or the word
representing it, as {#yajeta, dadAti, BAryam#}. Again, in the
verb the {#apUrva#} is not conveyed by the meaning of the radical
but by that part of it which implies the {%verbal notion%} ({#BA-#}
{#vanA#}), lastly, so far as the {%implicit%} understanding of the
verbal notion ({#arTaBAvanA#} or {#arTAtmaBAvanA#}) is concerned,
any inflection-affix added to the radical might convey it,
provided the connex of the sentence leaves no doubt, as
when the word {#-kAma#} (e. g. {#svargakAmaH#}) is added; but an
{%explicit%} understanding of it ({#SabdaBAvanA#} or {#aBiDABAvanA#})
is only imparted by the inflection-affixes of the {%potential,%}
{%leṭ, the imperative%} and by the affixes of the {%participles of the%}
{%passive future.%} ({%Mādhava:%} {#liNleqlowtavyapratyayamAtragatA Sa-#}

{#BAvanAyAM svargasya BAvyatvaM kamiyogAdavagamyate;#} in referring to
{%Kumārila:%} {#…vEdikaliNNAdInAM tadaBiDAyakatvAt#} (for this
reason {#apUrva#} is authoritative) {#. tato DAtvarTAtiriktaM kAlAnta-#}
{#raBAvi#} &c., see above, p. 198{%b,%} 1. 25).--As the unseen power
is the consequence of the performance of a sacrificial act which
‘has not existed before’ i. e. which is absolute ({%Mādhava:%} {#kaTaM#}
{#vinaSvareRa PalaM kartavyamityapekzAyAmapUrvaM kftvetyucyate . kaTamapUrvaM#}
{#kriyata ityapekzAyAM yAgAnuzWAnaprakAreReti#}) the term {#apUrva#}
assumes also the meaning of such a sacrificial act, and as
the latter requires always an authoritative injunction or
{#viDi,#} since it would not take place otherwise, {#apUrva#} occurs
also in the sense of such an authoritative injunction, viz.
<sup>b.</sup> a {%sacrificial act,%} especially a principal act, one not sub-
ordinate to another act and therefore possessing the un-
seen power of producing {%the%} result (i. e. heaven); e. g. in
{%Jaimini'%}s {%Sūtra:%} {#apUrve ca vikalpaH syAdyadi saMKyABiDAnam,#}
