{#antra#}¦ 1. n. ({#-ntram#}) and according to one author. also m. ({#-ntraH#}).
An intestine (mostly used in the plur. {#antrARi#}); e. g.
{#antrEH kalpitamaNgalapratisarAH…piSAcANganAH;#} or {#AttasnA-#}
{#GvantranetraH#} (a. v. l. instead of {#ArttaH paryastanetraH#} in the Mā-
latīm. ed. Calc. p. 78). According to Suśruta ‘the entrails
of a male are three fathoms and a half long, those of a
female half a fathom less’ ({#sArDatrivyAmAnyantrARi puMsAM strI-#}
{#RAmarDavyAmahInAni#}). Charaka divides them in {#sTUlAntra#} and
{#kzudrAntra,#} ‘the large and small intestines’. [The definition
given by Vijnāneśvara (on Yaju. 3. 94.): {#kzudrAntraM hftsTAntram#}
is probably therefore to be rendered ‘{#kzudrAntra#} are the entrails
which are nearer the heart’, while the {#sTUlAntra#} are near
the anus; comp. Suśruta: {#‘vAtavarconirasanaM sTUlAntrapratibadDaM#}
{#gudaM nAma marma’#}. The {#sTUlAntra#} in taken also by Vijnān. (on
Yajn. 3. 96.) in the usual sense, since he writes {#sTUlAntragu-#}
{#dodarARi prasidDAni#} ‘the three words of the text {#sTUlAntra,#}
{#guda#} and {#udara#} require no remark’.]
<div n="P">2. f. ({#-ntrI#}) The name of a potherb (Convolvulus ar-
genteus). [In the passage of the Amarak. {#CAgalAntryAvegI#}
some comm. divide {#CAgala-antrI-AvegI,#} others make a
compound of the two first; comp. also {#ajAntrI#}.] E. {#am,#}
uṇ. aff. {#ktra;#} accord. to another author. uṇ. aff. {#zwran#}. Pro-
bably, however, a contraction of {#antara,#} like {#avasra#} of {#avasara#}.
