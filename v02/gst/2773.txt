{#aniSita#}¦ m. f. n. ({#-taH-tA-tam#}) (ved.) Restless, incessant(?).
E. {#aniSi#} (a denom. from {#aniSa#}), kṛt aff. {#kta(?)#}. (Mean-
ing and etymology of this word are doubtful. According
to the native commentaries it would be a Tatpur. compounded
of {#a#} neg. and {#niSita,#} sharpened, sharp, and would mean
either: <sup>1</sup> not sharp, not injurious, or: <sup>2</sup> not difficult, easy,
or <sup>3</sup> not slender, not little; but these explanations, when
applied to the passages to which they refer, seem artificial.
