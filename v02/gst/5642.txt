--In the {%Śaṅkhya philosophy%} {#aprIti#} ‘pain’ is the essential
characteristic of the elementary quality {#rajas#} q. v., the
middle quality between clearness (goodness) and darkness
(sinfulness); {%Sāṅkhya Sūtra:%} {#prItyaprItivizAdAdyErguRAnAma-#}
{#nyonyaM vEDarmyam;#} {%Gaurapāda%} on the {%S. Kār.:%} {#aprItyAtmakaM rajaH;#}
but the term ‘pain’ is there, according to the commenta-
tors, a general term which comprises besides its own notion
that of {%hatred, violence, envy, abuse%} and {%wickedness,%} or various
kinds of {%grief%} in general: {%Sāṅkhya Chandrikā:%} {#aprItirduHKa-#}
{#mupalakzaRaM pradvezadrohamatsaranindAnikftInAm;#} {%Vijnānāch.:%} {#rajo#}
{#'pi SokAdinAnABedaM samAsataH duHKAtmakam;#} in a similar
manner {%Manu,%} who names however {#duHKa#} and {#aprIti#} as
two distinct qualities connected with {#rajas,#} the first, as it
were, as the quality inherent in it, the second as the effect
produced by it, while the term {#aprIti#} is used by the
Sāṅkhya writers in either acceptation; {%Manu:%} {#yattu duHKasa-#}
