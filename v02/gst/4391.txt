{#anvakzam#}¦ Avyayībh. <sup>1</sup> After, afterwards. <sup>2</sup> Immediately, in-
stantaneously. E. {#anu#} and {#akzi,#} samās. aff. {#wac#} (accord-
ing to a Gaṇa to Pāṇini; the comm. on the Amarak. and
Vijnānesvara in the Mitākṣara derive it from {#anu#} and {#akza#}
{#(= indriya): ‘anugatamakzam’;#} equally so Vallabhagaṇi on
Hemachandra {#‘akzasya paScAdanvakzam’#}. The second meaning
would arise according to Vijnān. from rendering the word
‘{#yAvaddarSanam,#} as far as a glance’. But it is more probable
to consider {#anvakza#} as a deriv. from {#ac#} with {#anu,#} kṛt aff. {#ksa#}.
