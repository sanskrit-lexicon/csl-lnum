<div n="P">II. Bahuvr. m. ({#-yaH#}) <sup>1</sup> (In the Nyāya philosophy.)
Founded on the mutual relation (between two objects),
one of the five modes of a {#tarka#} (q. v.), viz. an {%argumen-%}
{%tatio ad absurdum,%} which consists in founding a premise
on the imaginary relation between two objects and in
drawing a conclusion from it which is inadmissible.
This kind of argumentation may again ‘be threefold ac-
cording to whether the argument of the premise is taken
from the notion of origin or from that of actuality or from
that of comprehension’ ({#‘sa cotpattisTitijYaptidvArA treDA#}
{#…. tadapekzApekzitvanibanDano'nizwaprasaNgaH ..’#}). For
the other four modes of a {#tarka#} see: {#AtmASraya, cakraka, ana-#}
{#vasTA#} and {#tadanyabADitArTaprasaNga#}. [A commentator of the
Sāṅkhya-Pravachana applies three of these terms to the ex-
planation of the Sūtra: {#‘tadyoge tatsidDAvanyonyASrayatvam’#} in
this manner: {#‘avidyAyogAdavidyAsidDO cAnyonyASrayatvamA-#}
{#tmASrayatvamanavasTA veti SezaH ..’#}.] <sup>2</sup> (In the Sāṅkhya philos.)
Resting on one another, supporting one another; a property
of the three {#guRa#} or qualities {#sattva, rajas#} and {#tamas,#} ‘these
qualities resting on each other like binary atoms’; see {#anyo-#}
{#nyajanana#} and {#anyonyASrayavftti#}. E. {#anyonya#} and {#ASraya#}.
