{#aByantarakaraRa#}¦ Karmadh. ({#-Ram#}) The same as {#antaHkaraRam;#}
and the reverse of {#vAhyakaraRa#}. This form of the word oc-
curs in some Mss., but the more correct form is {#AByantara-#}
{#karaRa#} q. v.; and the compound {#vAhyAByantarakaraRa#} which is
of frequent occurrence in {%Vedānta-, Sāṅkhya-%} and {%Yoga%}
writings, is to be analyzed therefore: {#vAhya-ABya°-ka°#}.
E. see {#AByantarakaraRa#}.
