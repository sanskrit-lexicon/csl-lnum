{#apsumat#}¦ m. f. n. ({#-mAn-matI-mat#}) <sup>1</sup> Having or possessing
what is in water or arises from water; e. g. Agni so called
from his combination with the fire of lightning which is in,
or comes from, the rain-waters; or in the {%Chhāndogya Up.:%}
{#na hApsu prEtyapsumAnBavati ya etadevaM vidvAnsarvAsvapsu paYcaviDaM#}
{#sAmopAste#} (where {%Ānandajn.%} explains the word ‘possessed
with water’, viz. {#asAvupAsako marusTalIzvapi yaTecCamudaka-#}
{#vAnBavatItyarTaH,#} but it is perhaps better to say that such a
worshipper becomes possessed with all the benefits that
are in, or come from, water). <sup>2</sup> Containing, or accom-
panied with, the word {#apsu;#} as verses, e. g. in the {%Śatap.:%}
{#apsumatIByAmagneretadvESvAnarasya stotram;#} or as oblations, e. g.

{#ca . apsu me somo'bravIdityanuvAkye . tatra cApsuSabdo'sti#}.
E. {#apsu#} (loc. plur. of {#ap#}), taddh. aff. {#matup#}.
