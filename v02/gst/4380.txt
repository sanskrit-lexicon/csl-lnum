{#anyonyABAva#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-vaH#}) (In the Vaiśeṣika philosophy.)
Mutual negation, one of the four divisions of {#aBAva#} q. v.;
viz. that kind of negation or mutual exclusion which is held
to exist between notions that have no property in common;
indifference considered as a negation of heterogeneous notions;
as if one says: ‘shape’ is not ‘jar’ ({#‘anyonyABAvatvaM tAdAtmyasaM-#}
{#banDAvacCinnapratiyogitAkABAvatvam’#}). This notion is different
therefore from that of {#pfTaktva#} q. v. E. {#anyonya#} and {#aBAva#}.
