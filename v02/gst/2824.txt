I. {#anu#}¦ ind. (see {#nipAta, upasarga, gati, karmapravacanIya#}). A
particle implying the notion of ‘after’ in its literal and
metaphorical acceptations; it is used either as a separable
preposition or as a prefix to verbs, but, in the latter ca-
pacity, in the Vedas and in archaic passages of the epic
literature, also detached from the verb, very much in the
same manner as German prepositions when connected with
verbs; in the Vedas it is sometimes also used adverbially.
With nouns it may form Avyayībh., Tatpur. and Bahuvr.
compounds. It means:

river’. <sup>4</sup> To the part or share of; e. g. {#yadatra mAmanu syAt#}

or {#anuqudyajYamanu prAvarzat#} ‘it rained in consequence of the
hymns of Sākalya (having been recited) or in consequence

plying imitation); in accordance with, agreeably to, lit.
