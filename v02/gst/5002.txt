{#apasPurat#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-n-ntI-t#}) The same as {#apasPura;#}
{#anapasPurat#} ‘not injured, unhurt’; also as an epithet of a
cow (according to {%Sāyaṇa%} on {%Ṛgv.%} 4. 42. 10., viz. {#anavahiM-#}
{#sita#}). {%Mahidhara,%} however, explains the word {#apasPurat#}
in the corresponding verse of the {%Vājas.%} 7. 10. ‘going to
another’ i. e. running away, and {#anapasPurat#} ‘not going to
another’ i. e. not running away. This latter sense being more
congenial with the context, it is probably not unsafe to
infer that the words {#apasPur#} and {#apasPura#} will also have to
be taken in Mahīdhara's meaning of {#apasPurat,#} and {#anapa-#}
{#sPur, anapasPura#} qq. vv. in Mahīdhara's meaning of {#anapa-#}
{#sPurat#}.--E. {#sPur#} with {#apa,#} kṛt aff. {#Satf#}.
