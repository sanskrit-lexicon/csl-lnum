{#anAraByADIta#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-taH-tA-tam#}) Not read in con-
nexion with chapters or books treating authoritatively on
vaidik rites or sacrifices; said of passages, esp. in the
Brāhmaṇas, which treat on rites, sacrifices &c. not to be
connected with other passages with which they may happen
[Page078-a+ 56]
to be found together, the injunctions of the latter not be-
ing applicable to those of the former. A ceremonial, for
instance, taught in an anārabhyādhīta, would not be con-
sidered as the essential part of another ceremonial, treated
in passages, called ārabhyādhīta, which may precede or
follow it, nor share in the general rules concerning these;
and it is, therefore, always the object of special rules which
define its position amongst the other parts of the ritual and
its applicability. E. {#a#} neg. and {#AraByADIta#}.
