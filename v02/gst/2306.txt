{#ananvaya#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-yaH#}) (In rhetoric.) One of the Ālaṅkā-
ras or figures of speech: comparing an object to itself, with
respect to its being the only one of its class as to the qua-
lities expressed and therefore not liable to comparison with
any thing else; e. g. the moon shines like a moon i. e. like
a very moon, a moon indeed. E. {#a#} neg. and {#anvaya,#} literally:
‘want of connexion sc. with other objects’.
