pressed by the affixes called in {%Pāṇini'%}s system {#cvi#} and
{#sAti,#} and in some denominatives by the affix {#kyaN;#} see
the Sūtras quoted, and V. 4. 51-55.--The Calcutta Paṇḍits
who have compiled a comm. on {%Pāṇ.%} have misapplied this

word in using it in the sense of ‘the {%being%} or taking place
of what has not been before’, when they comment on the
word {#AScarya#} ‘wonderful’, VI. 1. 174.; neither {%Patanjali%} and
his comm., nor the {%Kāś.%} or the {%Siddhk.%} make use of the
word at this occasion.] E. {#aBUta#} and {#tadBAva#}.
