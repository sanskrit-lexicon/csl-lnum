{#acCa#}¦ I. m. f. n. ({#-cCaH-cCA-cCam#}) Clear, transparent. See {#Ca#}.
<div n="P">II. m. ({#-cCaH#}) <sup>1</sup> Crystal. <sup>2</sup> A bear (see {#fkza#}).
<div n="P">III. ind. (see {#nipAta#}) A kind of preposition (or {#gati#} q. v.)
with the meaning of ‘to, unto, before, in front’, or ‘obtain-
ing, taking possession of’. Its use seems to be restricted
to the vaidik literature where it appears, for the most
part, in the protracted form {#acCA#}. It occurs only in con-
junction with verbs implying motion or speech--especially
with {#aj, i, gam, yA, naS, nu, vA, vac, vad#}--either pre-
ceding or following them and requiring the noun which de-
pends upon this combination to stand in the accusative or in
[Page023-a+ 56]
the locative; the latter case, however, is only exceptional.--
The word is given also in the form {#acCam#}. E. unknown.
That which is given is: {#a#} neg. and {#Co,#} kṛt affix {#ka,#}
‘not cutting or injuring sc. the sight’ and would refer
only to I. and to II. 1. in the sense of ‘not easily cut’.
