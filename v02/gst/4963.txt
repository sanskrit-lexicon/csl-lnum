<div n="P">3. adv. ({#-zWu#}) <sup>1</sup> Contrary, adversely. <sup>2</sup> Faultlessly, bla-
melessly. <sup>3</sup> Handsomely. [The {%Medinī%} has the meaning {#vAma;#}
the latter word however, compared to {#cAru#} of the {%Bhūri-%}

verb., of {%Hemach.%} and the {%Med.,%} can scarcely be taken in
another sense than in that of ‘beautiful’; the meaning
‘ignorant, infantine’ rests on the authority of the {%Bhūripr.%}
and the {%Uṇṇādikoṣa%} which have the meaning {#bAla,#} the

former together with, the latter without, {#kAla#}.--The form
of the adv. {#‘apazWum’#} in the present ed. of the {%Śiśupālab.%}

remarkable, but the mere scanning of the verse--without
any reference to Mss.--might have shown that it is a mis-
print, instead of {#apazWu#}.] E. {#sTA#} with {#apa,#} uṇ. aff. {#ku#}.
