{#anuvaMSa#}¦ I. Tatpur. m. ({#-SaH#}) <sup>1</sup> A genealogical table, a song
embodying such tables or lists. (A comm. renders this word
simply with {#gATA#} ‘a song’ and {#anuvaMSya#} with {#gAtavya;#} the
meaning ‘song’ however seems too general and would not
always convey a distinct meaning of {#anuvaMSa#}.)
<div n="P">II. Avyayībh. ({#-Sam#}) According to the families or races.
(The word {#AnuvaMSya#} is derived from the Avyayībh., not
from the Tatpur.) E. {#anu#} and {#vaMSa#} (the E. of I. 1. however
according to the comm. mentioned, would have to be in
conformity with that given of {#vaMSa, vam#} with {#anu,#} kṛt aff. {#Sa#}).
