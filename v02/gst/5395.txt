{#apraja#}¦ Tatpur. 1. m. f. n. ({#-jaH-jA-jam#}) <sup>1</sup> Unborn; e. g. in
the {%Ṛgv.:%} {#aprajAH santvatriRaH#} ‘may the demons not come
into existence’ ({%Sāyaṇa:%} {#anutpannAH santu#}). <sup>2</sup> Not productive
(of children), unprolific; e. g. {#mETunam#}.
<div n="P">2. m. ({#-jaH#}) A man who has not begot (children);
e. g. {%Vṛhaspati%} (as quoted by the {%Vīramitrodaya%}): {#sapiRqa-#}
{#syAprajasyAMSaM sTAvaraM saptaDAkftam#}.
<div n="P">3. f. ({#-jA#}) <sup>1</sup> A female who has not borne (a child); e. g.
{%Vṛddhakātyāyana%} (as quoted in the {%Dāyat.%}): {#pitfByAM cEva#}
{#yaddattaM duhituH sTAvaraM Danam . aprajAyAmatItAyAM BrAtfgAmi#}
{#tu sarvadA#}. <sup>2</sup> One who cannot bear, a barren female; e. g.
in {%Kumārila'%}s {%Mīmānsā Vārtt.:%} {#prajA daSa mAsAngarBaM DftvA#}
{#ekAdaSamanu prajAyante tasmAdaSvataryo'prajAH#}. E. {#a#} neg. and
{#praja#}. (This word is always {%Tatpur.,%} with the udātta on
the first syllable, and must not be analyzed as a {%Bahuvr.%}
of {#a#} priv. and {#prajA,#} for {%Pāṇini%} enjoins V. 4. 122., that the
latter assumes {%‘always’%} the form {#aprajas,#} and his rule is
neither contradicted nor restricted by any of his commen-
tators; the meanings of {#apraja#} and {#aprajas#} will often coin-
cide in bearing--comp. also {#aprajAtA, apaprajAtA, apra-#}
{#sUtA--,#} but their difference will be perceived in such in-
stances as given above, e. g. in {#aSvataryo'prajAH#} when the
Bahuvr. epithet ‘without progeny’ would alter the sense,
or in {%Chāṇakya'%}s {#mETunamaprajam,#} since it would be absurd to
speak of a {#mETuna#} ‘without children’, instead of an unpro-
lific one.)
