{#annamaya#}¦ 1. m. f. n. ({#-yaH-yI-yam#}) <sup>1</sup> Made of, consisting of, the
metaphysical or mystical {#anna#} (2. 2.) q. v.; e. g. {#annamayaM hi somyaM#}
{#manaH;#} the quality of the Supreme Soul in its lowest form of
manifestation; see {#anna#} 2. 2, {#prARamaya, manomaya, vijYAnamaya#}
and {#Anandamaya;#} comp. also {#annarasamaya; annamayo rasaH,#} the same
as {#annarasa#} (2. b.) q. v. <sup>2</sup> Chiefly (but not entirely) consisting of
boiled rice &c. (see the meanings of {#anna#}); e. g. {#annamayo yajYaH#}.
<div n="P">2. n. ({#-yam#}) Plenty of boiled rice, food &c. [The two
latter meanings of this word result from the different inter-
pretation of the commentators on Pāṇ. V. 4. 21; as regards
the first, it may be observed that {#annamaya#} is not allowed to
mean ‘made of, or consisting of, food, boiled rice &c.’ in the
usual, non-mystical sense of this word; the word expressing
this notion is {#Anna#}.] E. {#anna,#} taddh. aff. {#mayaw#}.
