{#anuttaropapAtika#}¦ m. pl. ({#-kAH#}) Apparently the same as {#anuttara#}
m. pl.: the name of the Jaina gods so called. According
to a commentary it would mean literally ‘those who have
the highest origin i. e. who are born in the five Vimānas’
from which the five classes of the {#anuttarAH#} derive their
appellations. E. {#anuttaropapAtin#} ({#anuttara#} and {#upapAta,#}
taddh. aff. {#ini#}), taddh. aff. {#kan(?)#}.
