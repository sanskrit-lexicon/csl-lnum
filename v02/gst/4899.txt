{#apavarta#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-rtaH#}) (In Algebra.) The common measure,
the divisor which is assumed for both or either of the quan-
tities, without leaving a remainder ({%Colebr. Brahmagupta%}
p. 363); e. g. {#utpatsyamAnayEvaM mUlakaraRyAlpayA caturguRayA .#}
{#yAsAmapavartaH syAdrUpakftestA viSoDyAH syuH . apavartAdapi#}
{#labDA mUlakaraRyo Bavanti tAScApi .#} ‘those terms are to be
subtracted from the square of the rational number, which
are exactly measured by four times the smaller radical surd
thence to be deduced; the quotients found by that common
measure are surds in the root’. (In this passage from the
{%Vījagaṇita%} p. 18 Colebrooke (Alg. p. 153) has had however
instead of the first {#apavarta,#} the reading {#apavartana#} q. v.) E.
{#vft,#} in the caus., with {#apa,#} kṛt aff. {#GaY#}.
