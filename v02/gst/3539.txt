{#anUpa#}¦ I. 1. Bahuvr. 1. m. f. n. ({#-paH-pA-pam#}) Watery, rich in
water. 2. m. ({#-paH#}) (Used in a comm. of the Rāmāyaṇa also
as a neuter: {#-pam#}.) <sup>1</sup> A moist country. According to the di-
vision of the medical Ātreya-Sanhitā one of the three cli-
mates of India--see besides {#jANgala#} and {#sADAraRa;#} it is
defined in Wise's Hindu system of Medicine as having much
water on its surface, being intersected by rivers and irregular
in its surface, with high mountains and tall trees; the air
being there cool and the wind temperate; abounding in
grass, water flowers, geese, ducks, cranes, fish, serpents &c.,
unhealthy and its inhabitants being fat, indolent and weak.
<sup>2</sup> (ved.) A jar ({#kalaSa#}). <sup>3</sup> The name of a country (mentioned
f. i. amongst those conquered by Rudradāman, one of the
Sinha-kings).
<div n="P">2. Tatpur. m. ({#-paH#}) <sup>1</sup> A buffalo. [<sup>2</sup> Any animal living
in the water or on shore. <sup>3</sup> The francoline partridge ({#ti-#}
{#ttiraka#}). <sup>4</sup> An elephant. <sup>5</sup> A frog ({#plava#}). <sup>6</sup> Any shelled
animal which lives in the water. <sup>7</sup> An amphibious animal.
<sup>8</sup> A fish. (The last seven meanings are given on the authority
of several medical authors.)] <sup>9</sup> A proper name, an abbre-
viation of {#anUpasiMha#} q. v. See {#anUpavilAsa#}. E. {#anu#} and
{#ap,#} changed, according to Pāṇini, to {#Up,#} samāsānta aff.
{#a#} (the affix being the same in the Tatpur. and the Bahuvr.,
according to the Kāśikā), but as regards the change of the
vowel, it is more probable that {#a#} of {#ap#} has got lost and
the preceding vowel lengthened by way of compensation,
analogously to {#samIpa, pratIpa, dvIpa, vIpa#} &c. In {#darBAnUpa#}
q. v. the {#n#} is not changed to {#R#}.
<div n="P">II. Tatpur. m. ({#-paH#}) (ved.) Throwing or effusing in re-
[Page110-b+ 56]
gular succession or according to (scil. one's functions); an
epithet of the three divinities Parjanya, Vāyu and Āditya
‘who effuse on the earth (i. e. produce there) rain, cold and
heat successively or according to their functions’ (accord.
to Yāska and Sāyaṇa). E. {#vap#} with {#anu,#} kṛt aff. {#ac(?),#}
but it is better perhaps to assume that this {#anUpa#} means
originally ‘favourable, propitious’ and comes from {#anu#} and
{#ap,#} kṛt aff. {#ac#}. For the latter etym. see the Preface.
