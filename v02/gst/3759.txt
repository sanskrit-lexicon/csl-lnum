{#antaraNgatara#}¦ m. f. n. ({#-raH-rA-ram#}) The same as {#vahiraNga#} q. v.,
i. e. not affecting the essential portion of the base (see {#aNga#}) of
a word, unessential to it (liter. ‘beyond what affects the es-
sential portion of the {#aNga#}’); e. g. the Mahābh. in discussing
on Pāṇ. I. 2. 48. gives the instance {#priyasenAnIkaH#} which is
apparently in contradiction with the rule, as regards the
{#I,#} and observes {#antaraNgaM hrasvatvaM . antaraNgataraH kap#} ‘the short-
ness of the vowel is essential (in the rule) to the {#aNga,#} but
the affix {#kap#} is unessential to it’; Kaiyy.: {#kap tu samAsavi-#}
{#SezaM bahuvrIhiM nadyuttarapadamapekzata iti vahiraNgaH#} ‘but {#kap#} con-
cerns only the special Bahuvrīhi compound, the latter part
of which is a noun of those termed {#nadI,#} hence it is un-
essential to the base’. E. {#antaraNga,#} taddh. aff. {#tarap#}.
