{#aBinnapadaSlizwa#}¦ Karmadh. n. ({#-zwam#}) (In Rhetoric.) A species
of paronomasia, considered as an {#alaNkAra#} (q. v.) or elegant
mode of expression, viz. a connexion of words which ad-
mit of a double interpretation, the sentence consisting chiefly
of {%such%} words (and not of words which would admit but
of one sense); an instance is the following verse of the
{%Bhaṭṭik.:%} {#BuvanaBarasahAnalaNGyaDAmnaH pururuciratnaBfto gurUrude-#}
{#hAn . SramaviDuravilInakUrmanakrAndaDatamudUQaBuvo girInahIMSca#}
(scil. {#jalaniDimagaman#}), where all the compounds are at-
tributes as well of {#girIn#} as of {#ahIn,#} according to the
double sense in which they may be taken. See {#Slizwa#} or
{#Sleza#}. E. {#aBinna-pada#} and {#Slizwa#}.
