{#aparagodAna#}¦ Karmadh. n. (?) ({#-nam#}) (In Buddhistic cosmo-
gony.) One of the four dvīpas or continents which are in
each of the innumerable earths, and the inhabitants of which
have faces of the same shape as the continent in which they
are born; the Aparagodāna is in shape like a round mirror
and 7000 Yojanas in extent, on the west of the Mahāmeru
which is in the centre of the earth and from its base to its
summit 168,000 Yojanas in height; in this continent merit
cannot be obtained. (Spence Hardy, Manual of Buddhism
pp. 4. 449.) E. {#apara#} and {#godAna#}.
