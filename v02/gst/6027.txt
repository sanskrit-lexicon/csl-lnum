{#aBiDAnacintAmaRi#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-RiH#}) ‘The gem that yields
every word desired’; the name of the first part of {%Hema-%}
{%chandra'%}s vocabulary or of the portion containing the syn-
onymes; the work is commented upon by {%Hemachandra%}
himself and by {%Vallabhagaṇi.%} (The latter portion of Hema-
chandra's vocabulary bears the title {%Anekārthasaṅgraha%} or
{%Nānārthasaṅgraha%} and is similar to, but not identical with,
{%Maheśvara'%}s {%Viśvaprakāśa;%} there must have existed or may
still exist an extensive commentary on it, probably by He-
machandra himself, as may be concluded from a single Ms.
leaf which is happily preserved of it in the British Museum.)
E. {#aBiDAna#} and {#cintAmaRi#}.
