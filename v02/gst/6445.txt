<div n="P">{%A.%} INAUGURATION OF A KING. This ceremony is either
part of a Rājasūya, and performed by a king at the end
of this sacrifice--when it is called {#punaraBizeka#} or {%second%}
{%inauguration,%} since the {%Abhisheka%} or first inauguration of a
king must have taken place previously--; or it is not
part of a sacrifice and occurs at a king's accession to the
throne--then it is the {#aBizeka#} proper. [Both ceremonies
are described in the {%Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,%} first the {%Punar-%}
{%abhisheka,%} then the {%Abhisheka;%} in conformity with this au-
thority the same order has been preserved in the following
account, since the {%Abhisheka%} ceremony refers in many re-
spects to that of the {%Punarabhisheka.%}]
<div n="P">{%a.%} The {%Punarabhisheka%} is performed by a king at the
end of a {%Rājasūya,%} after he has undergone preliminary
purification ({#dIkzA#}), when he has risen from the {%Avabhṛtha%}
ceremonies, has performed the {%Anūbandhya%} sacrifice and
completed the final rite, the {%Udavasanīyā.%} There must have
been prepared for the occasion a throne-seat ({#AsandI#}) of
the wood of the {%Udumbara%} (ficus glomerata), resting on
four legs a span ({#prAdeSa#}) high, with boards placed on
them ({#SIrzaRya;#} see below page 277{%b,%} line 6 ff.) and side boards
({#anUcya;#} see ibid.) of the dimension of a cubit (or two spans;
{#aratni,#} {%Sāyaṇa:%} {#prAdeSadvayamaratniH#}); the whole well fastened
together with a texture made of cords of {%Munja%} grass
(Saccharum munja), a tiger skin which is placed on the
seat with the hairs upwards and the neck to the east, a
large (four cornered) ladle ({#camasaH;#} {%Sāy.%} at a later occa-
sion: = {#catuzkoRo daRqayuktaH pAtraviSezaH#}) of {%Udumbara%} wood
and a branch of the same; in the ladle have been put eight
things: curd ({#daDi#}), honey ({#maDu#}), clarified butter ({#sarpis#}),
water proceeding from rain during sunshine, before it has fallen
down ({#AtapavarzyA ApaH;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#AtapayuktavarzaBavAH#}); blades
of {%Syāma%} grass ({#SazyARi;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#SyAmatfRAni#}), sprouts
({#tokmAni;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#aNkurARi#}), spirituous liquor ({#surA#}) and
{%Dūb%} grass ({#dUrvA,#} Panicum dactylon). (To prepare a site
for the throne three lines have been drawn on a place of
sacrifice with the sacrificial implement called {%Sphya%} (q. v.),
one southwards, another westwards and a third north-
wards); the one to the south is that on which the throne
is to be placed with its front towards the east, so that the two
[Page275-b+ 56]
feet to the north come to stand within the Vedi or sacri-
ficial ground and the two to the south without; this latter
spot occupied by the throne-seat is called {%Śrī;%} (as a type
of happiness or prosperity; {%Sāy.:%} {#SrIrvE saMpadrUpEva#}). The
place within the Vedi being small, but that without being
illimited, this position of the throne indicates that the sacri-
ficer may obtain definite and indefinite wishes within and
without the Vedi. The tiger skin is the type of increase
of Kshatriya power, for the tiger is the Kshatriya or hero
of the wild beasts; the Udumbara wood of the throne,
ladle and branch is the type of essential juice ({#Urj#} {%Sāy.:%}
= {#kzIrAdirasaH#}) and of food (which the sacrificer is sup-
posed to acquire by this symbol); curd, honey and clari-
fied butter typify the essence of water and plants; (curd and
butter, as {%Sāyaṇa%} observes, because they originate in grass
and water which are the food of cattle; honey, because it
originates in the juice of plants collected by bees); water pro-
ceeding from rain during sunshine, before it has fallen down
typifies (on account of the sunshine) lustre (or energy; {#tejas#})
and (rain being the consequence of oblations to the gods)
holiness ({#brahmavarcasam;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#SrutADyayanasaMpattiH#}); grass
and sprouts typify food ({#irA;#} they being the food of cattle),
hence prosperity ({#puzwi,#} increase) and progency ({#prajA#}); spi-
rituous liquor is the type of a Kshatriya's power (on ac-
count of its fierceness or hotness; {%Sāy.:%} {#surayA kzatriyasyEva#}
{#madayogAtkzatrarUpatvam#}) and of the essence of food (or rice,
liquor being made of rice; comp. {#annarasa; annasya rasaH;#} {%Sāy.:%}
{#annajanyatvAdannarasatvam#}); {%Dūb%} grass (being the Kshatriya of
the plants and firmly established in the soil with its many
roots) is the type of Kshatriya-power and of a firmly esta-
blished rule.--The principal features of the ceremony
itself are the following. The king who performs the sacrifice
kneels down at the back part of the throne-seat with his
face to the east and his right knee touching the ground
(while his left knee remains upwards); he then touches
with his hands the throne-seat and invites the gods to
ascend it together with various metres: {%Agni%} with the metre
Gāyatrī, {%Savitṛ%} with the Uṣṇih, {%Soma%} with the Anu-
ṣṭubh, {%Bṛhaspati%} with the Bṛhatī, {%Mitra%} and {%Varuṇa%}
with the Pankti, {%Indra%} with the Triṣṭubh, the {%Viśve-%}
{%Devās%} with the Jagatī, for the purpose of obtaining kingly
power ({#rAjyam;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#deSADipatyam#}), righteous govern-
ment ({#sAmrAjyam;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#DarmeRa pAlanam#}), increase of en-
joyment ({#BOjyam;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#BogasamfdDiH#}), independent rule
({#svArAjyam;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#aparADInatvam#}), attainment of more
distinguished qualities than those possessed by other kings
({#vErAjyam;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#itareByo BUpatiByo vESizwyam#}), coming
(after death) into the world of Brahman ({#pAramezWyam;#} {%Sāy.:%}
{#etaduktamEhikam#}--i. e. what precedes--{#aTAmuzmikamucyate .#}
{#pAramezWyaM prajApatilokaprAptiH#}) and obtaining there dominion
({#rAjyam;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#tatra rAjyamESvaryam#}), a mighty rule ({#mAhA-#}
{#rAjyam;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#tatratyeBya itareBya ADikyam#}), mastership
({#ADipatyam;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#tAnitarAnprati svAmitvam#}), indepen-
dence ({#svAvaSyam;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#apAratantyam#}) and a long resi-
dence there ({#AtizWam;#} {%Sāy.:%} {#cirakAlavAsitvam#}). [Of the
metres mentioned before each following metre has four
[Page276-a+ 56]
syllables more than each preceding one; the invitation itself
which is addressed to the gods is founded on the {%Ṛgv.%}
10. 130. 4.; and the company of the gods is solicited by the king
in order to ensure the attainment of what was before unat-
tained by him ({#yogaH;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#aprAptasya lABasya prAptiH#}) and
the preservation of what he has obtained ({#kzemaH;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#prA-#}
{#ptasya vastuno rakzaRam#}).] The gods have arrived and the king
now ascends himself the throne-seat, first with his right
and then with his left knee.--The next ceremony is the
propitiation of the liquid in the ladle, which is performed
by the priest who will pour it over the king, by reciting
the hymn: ‘waters behold me with a favourable eye, with
a favourable body touch my skin; all fires, for they reside
in water, I invoke on your account; do you produce in me
beauty, bodily strength and energy’; and by the king re-
peating these words after him. If this propitiation did not
take place, the liquid would destroy the vigour of the king.
(The quoted verse occurs, though with some variations, in
the {%Atharvav.%} 10. 1. 12 and 13.) After this, the priest covers
the head of the king with the {%Udumbara%}-branch and pours
the liquid over him while reciting the following three {%Ṛg-%}
{%veda%}-verses: ‘These waters are most propitious, they have
healing power to free from all disease ({%Sāy.%} ‘poverty and
other diseases’: {#dAridryAdirogasya BezajIH#}); they are the
augmenters of kingly power, and (therefore) its supporters;
they are immortal.’ ‘With which Prajāpati sprinkled In-
dra, the king Soma and Manu, with these I sprinkle thee,
that thou becomest king of kings in this world.’ ‘The
queen, thy mother, bore thee to be great amongst the
great, and a righteous ruler over men; an auspicious mother
bore thee’; and this {%Yajurveda%}-verse: ‘The divine Savitṛ has
given his consent, therefore I pour (this liquid) over thee
with the arms of the Aśvins ({%Sāyaṇa:%} not with my own),
with the hands of Pūṣan, with the beauty of Agni ({#tejas;#}
{%Sāy.:%} = {#SArIrakAntiH#}), with the radiance of Sūrya ({#varcas;#}
{%Sāy.:%} = {#vAhyaprakASaH#}) and with the (sharp) senses of Indra
({#indriyam;#} {%Sāy.%} ‘with the sharpness of the eyes’ &c.: =
{#cakzurAdipAwavam#}), for the sake of strength ({#balam#}), prospe-
rity ({#SrIH;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#hastyaSvAdisaMpad#}), glory and increase of
food ({#annam;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#annasamfdDiH#})’. If the priest wishes
that the king may enjoy good health (lit. may eat food),
he must, after these verses, utter the sacred word {%Bhūr!%}
(earth!). If he wishes that the king may enjoy good health
and live to see a son and a grandson ({#dvipuruza#}) he must
utter the sacred words: {%Bhūr! Bhuvas!%} (earth! intermediate
region between earth and sun!), and if he wishes him to
enjoy good health and live to see three generations ({#tri-#}
{#puruza#}), or if he wishes him to remain unrivalled, he must
utter the sacred words: {%Bhūr! Bhuvas! Swar!%} (earth! inter-
mediate region! heaven!). [The {%text%} of the {%Aitar. Br.%} men-
tions on this occasion that some authorities object to the
enunciation of the latter words; but it quotes, too, the
opinion of the Ṛṣi {%Satyakāma,%} the son of {%Jābālā,%} who
maintains that a king who is not inaugurated with these
{%Vyāhṛtis%} or sacred words, will die before the due term of
his life, and that of {%Uddālaka,%} the son of {%Aruṇa,%} who says
[Page276-b+ 56]
that a king who is inaugurated with these words, will ar-
rive at the full term of his life and conquer his enemies.]
Since at the pouring of the liquid the essence of water,
holiness and the other boons which are conferred on the
king by the ingredients placed in the ladle, are shed and
go away, as it were, from the king, he must, to secure
them, before the liquid is poured over him, make two
oblations (while uttering the words: {#brahma prapadye svAhA kzatraM#}
{#prapadye svAhA#} i. e. I am obtaining holiness, Svāhā! I am
obtaining power, Svāhā!). After the liquid has been
poured over the king, the priest places in his hand a
goblet of spirituous liquor and recites the following verse
({%Ṛgv.%} 9. 1. 1. = {%Sāmav.%} 2. 39. = {%Vājas.%} 26. 25.): ‘Soma with
thy most sweet exhilarating drops purify (this sacrificer),
for thou wast poured out for Indra to drink.’ Then he
recites and makes the king repeat after him the following
invocation: ‘(Soma and spirituous liquor), because a se-
parate residence has been allotted to you by the gods,
therefore do not combine in the lofty æther; liquor, thou
art powerful, but thou, Soma, art a king; do not harm him
(the king), when you enter into your several receptacles
(i. e. into his stomach).’ [This verse occurs with some
variations in the {%Vājas.%} 19. 7.] By the recital of these verses
spirituous liquor and Soma become identified; compare
page 279{%a,%} line 52ff. Having drunk the king then presents
the rest to a man whom he considers his friend, for drink-
ing out of the same cup is the mutual practice of friends.
He then places the Udumbara branch on the ground as a
symbol of essential juice ({#Urj#}) and food, and prepares
himself for descending from the throne-seat; but while he
is still seated and puts his feet on the ground he says: ‘I
firmly stand on heaven and earth, I firmly stand on ex-
haled and inhaled air ({#prARa#} and {#apAna#}), I firmly stand on
day and night, I firmly stand on food and drink; on what
is Brahmaṇa, on what is Kshatriya, on these three worlds
stand I firmly.’ He then descends, sits down on the ground
with his face towards the east, utters thrice the words
‘adoration to what is Brāhmaṇa’ and offers a gift ({%Sāy.:%}
a cow) to a Brāhmaṇa; the object of this gift is the at-
tainment of victory in general ({#jitiH#}), of victory every-
where ({#aBijitiH;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#aBitaH sarvezu deSezu jitiH#}); of
victory over strong and weak enemies ({#vijitiH;#} {%Sāy.:%} =
{#prabaladurbalaSatrURAM tAratamyena viviDo jayaH#}) and of complete
victory ({#saMjitiH;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#SatrutvarAhityAya samyagjayaH#}); and
his threefold expression of adoration to what is a Brāhmaṇa
implies that a kingdom prospers and has valiant men when
it is under the control of the Brāhmaṇas, and that a valiant
son will be born to him. After this ceremony the king
rises and puts fuel into the Āhavanīya fire while uttering
the words: ‘(wood) thou art fuel, bestow on me sharpness
of sense and strength of body’. Then he is going to take
three steps to the east, north (and as {%Sāy.%} explains), to the
north-cast, but previously to doing so points to the region,
and addresses the step he is about to take with these words:
‘thou subduest for me the regions; enable me therefore to
adore the gods, and may attainment of my desires and preser-
[Page277-a+ 56]
vation of what I have attained be granted to me; may there be
no danger (or fear) to me’. [The injunctions which follow in
the text of the {%Aitar. Br.%} are merely incidental and refer
to the conduct of a king and the ceremonies he has to per-
form, when his assistance in warfare is sought for by
another king.] Upon this and having recited the {%Ṛgveda%}-
verse (10. 131. 1.), with the purpose of freeing himself from
enemies, he returns to his palace, when he will be without
foes and peril and day by day increase in prosperity, au-
thority and sovereignty. There he sits down by the do-
mestic fire and the Adhwaryu priest makes for him, out
of a goblet, four times three oblations with clarified butter
to Indra while reciting the three {%Ṛgveda%}-verses 9. 110. 1-3.
or {%Sāmav.%} 2. 714. 716. 715. [The recital of these verses takes
place in a peculiar manner, called {#prapadam,#} which consists
in inserting between the syllables of some word in the
second Pāda of either of these verses certain other words
which are foreign to the text of the {%Ṛgv.%}-hymn, viz. the
words {#BUrbrahma prARamamftaM prapadyate'yamasO Sarma varmABayaM svastaye#}
{#saha prajayA saha paSuBiH#} between the second and third syl-
lables of the word {#vftrARi#} in the second Pāda of {%Ṛgv.%} 9.
110. 1.; the words {#Buvo brahma#} &c. {#…paSuBiH#} between the
second and third syllables of the word {#samaryarAjye#} in the
second Pāda of {%Ṛgv.%} 9. 110. 2.; and the words {#svarbrahma#} &c.
{#…paSuBiH#} between the first and second syllables of the
word {#SakmanA#} in the second Pāda of {%Ṛgv.%} 9. 110. 3.; the
sense of these words is: ‘he (the king) seeks the protection
of earth ({#BUr;#} in the second verse…of {#Buvas#} or the inter-
mediate region; in the third of {#svar#} or heaven), of the
Veda, of life, of Amṛta; for the sake of his bliss grant
him (o Indra) happiness, armour and safety with his
children and his cattle’.] A king for whom these libations
are made to Indra in the indicated manner becomes free
from disease, cannot be injured by enemies, is exempt
from poverty, everywhere protected against danger, and
thus becomes victorious in all the quarters, and after death
established in Indra's heaven.--At the end of the whole
ceremony the king prays for increase in cows, horses and
progeny and more especially to obtain a son who would
be liberal towards the priests at his sacrifices and a power-
ful protector of his subjects.--Priests who understand
well how to perform the whole rite will raise the king to
an exalted position; those on the contrary who are igno-
rant of the manner in which it is to be performed, will
bring him unto perdition. (As an instance of the efficacy
of this part of the Rājasūya sacrifice when performed by
priests who well understand their duties, the text of the {%Aitar.%}
{%Br.%} quotes the instance of {%Janamejaya,%} the son of {%Parīkṣit.%})
<div n="P">{%b.%} The rites of the {%Abhisheka%} which is not part of a
Rājasūya sacrifice, but a ceremony performed at a king's
accession to the throne, are similar to, but not identical
with, those of the {%Punarabhisheka;%} they are founded on
the proceedings which took place when Indra was conse-
crated by the gods as their supreme ruler, and which form
the subject of the 38<sup>th</sup> chapter of the {%Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.%}
It is there told that the throne-seat which served at Indra's
[Page277-b+ 56]
inauguration was made of {%Ṛgveda%}-verses, its eight parts
consisting of {%Sāmaveda%}-verses, viz. the two fore-legs of
the {%Bṛhat%} and {%Rathantara,%} the two hind-legs of the {%Vai-%}
{%rūpa%} and {%Vairāja,%} the two top boards of the {%Śākvara%} and
{%Raivata,%} and the two side boards of the {%Naudhasa%} and
{%Kāleya.%} [In the corresponding passage of the {%Punarabhi-%}
{%sheka, Sāyaṇa%} speaks of {%several%} {#SorzaRya#} and renders the word
‘boards placed on the legs of the throne-seat’: {#tezAM pA-#}
{#dAnAM SirasyupariBAge'vasTitAni SIrzaRyAni;#} in the pre-
sent passage the text has the dual {#SIrzaRye#} which {%Sāyaṇa%}
explains as the board where the head of Indra and, by
implication, as the board where his feet rest upon: {#Asa-#}
{#ndyAM SayAnasyendrasya SirodeSasTaM PalakaM SIrzaRyam . tacca pAda-#}
{#deSAvikftasya PalakasyApyupalakzaRam;#} {%Sāyaṇa%} likewise speaks
in his comm. on the first passage of several {#anUcya,#} while
the text of the latter mentions distinctly two, viz. {#anUcye;#}
the former explanation of {#SIrzaRya#} seems more natural, since
the latter is at variance with the dimensions of the throne-
seat stated before, but it is probably more correct to view
the compound {#SIrzaRyAnUcyAni#} which occurs in the chapter
on the Punarabhisheka, as representing two duals]; of the
threads of the texture which was to hold this structure to-
gether, those that went lengthwise were made of {%Ṛgveda%}-
and those that went crossways of {%Sāmaveda-,%} the intervals
being {%Yajurveda%}-verses; the covering of the throne was
(the goddess of) {%Glory,%} the pillow ({%Sāy.:%} where his head
rested upon) {%Śrī%} (the goddess of Happiness). {%Savītṛ%} and
{%Bṛhaspati%} supported the fore-legs, {%Vāyu%} and {%Pūṣan%} the
hind-legs, {%Mitra%} and {%Varuṇa%} the two top boards and the
two {%Aśvins%} the two side boards of the throne-seat, while
Indra ascended it after having invited the {%Vasus%} to take
place on it with the metre Gāyatrī, the Stoma (q. v.) Tri-
vṛt and the Sāman (q. v.) Rathantara for the sake of ob-
taining righteous government ({#sAmrAjya#}), the {%Rudras%} for
increase of enjoyment ({#BOjya#}), the {%Adityas%} for independent
rule ({#svArAjya#}), the {%Viśve-Devas%} for the attainment of dis-
tinguished qualities ({#vErAjya#}), the {%Sādhyas%} and {%Āptyas%} for
dominion ({#rAjya#}), the {%Maruts%} and {%Āṅgirasas%} for coming into
the world of Brahman ({#pAramezwya#}), superiority ({#mAhArAjya#}),
mastership ({#ADipatya#}), independence ({#svAvaSya#}) and a long
residence there ({#AtizWa#}), these divinities being accompanied
severally, like the Vasus, with various metres, Stomas
and Sāmans (as specified in the text of the {%Ait. Br.%}). All
these gods having then proclaimed the high qualities of
Indra, to strike terror, by their panegyric, into the mind
of his enemies, and Prajāpati who performed the function
of inaugurating priest, having recited the {%Ṛgveda%}-verse 1.
25. 10. (where between the ending words {#sAmrAjyAya#} and
{#sukratuH#} the words {#BOjyAya, svArAjyAya#} &c. &c. are inserted),
the latter placed himself before (i. e. east of) the throne with
his face towards the west, covered the head of Indra with a
moist {%Udumbara%} branch (i. e. with an Udumbara branch the
leaves of which had been wetted) and a gold Pavitra (q. v.)
and sprinkled him with the liquid, while reciting the three
{%Ṛgveda%}-verses ‘these waters &c.’, the {%Yajurveda%}-verse
‘the divine Savitṛ &c.’ and uttering the three sacred words,
[Page278-a+ 56]
{%Bhūr, Bhuvas, Swar%} (see above page 276 {%a,%} line 22 ff.). Thirty-
one days after this inauguration by Prajāpati, the divine
{%Vasus%} sprinkled him in the East with the same liquid while
reciting the same verses and uttering the same sacred words,
to ensure his righteous government ({#sAmrAjya#}), hence the
inaugurated kings of the Eastern peoples are called {%Samrāj;%}
next in thirty-one days the {%Rudras%} performed the same
ceremony in the South to ensure his increase of enjoyment
({#BOjya#}), hence the inaugurated kings of the {%Satwats%} in the
South are called {%Bhoja;%} then in other thirty-one days the
{%Ādityas%} performed this ceremony in the West, to ensure
his independent rule ({#svArAjya#}), hence the inaugurated kings
of the {%Nīchyas%} and {%Apāchyas%} in the West are called {%Svarāj;%}
then in other thirty-one days, the {%Viśve-Devas%} in the North,
to ensure his attainment of higher qualities than those pos-
sessed by others ({#vErAjya#}), hence the inaugurated kings of
the {%Uttarakurus%} and {%Uttaramadras%} are called {%Virāj;%} after-
wards in other thirty-one days the {%Sādhyas%} and {%Āptyas%}
performed the same ceremony in the central region (which
is the ‘fixed’ region, since east, west &c. become deter-
mined through it, and which at the same time is the region
where the vaidik rites are established), for the sake of his
rulership ({#rAjya#}), hence the inaugurated kings of the {%Kurus%}
and {%Pañchālas%} and of the {%Vaśas%} and {%Uśīnaras%} in that re-
gion are called {%Rājan.%} Lastly, in further thirty-one days the
{%Maruts%} and the {%Angirasas%} performed this ceremony in the upper
region (or Swarga) to ensure his attainment of the supreme
abode ({#pAramezWya#}), his mighty rule there over every one
({#mAhArAjya#}), as well as his mastership ({#ADipatya#}), inde-
pendence ({#svAvaSya#}) and long residence there ({#AtizWa#}), hence
he attained the supreme abode ({#paramezWin#}) and became
united with Prajāpati ({#prAjApatya#}). ‘Thus inaugurated by
that great inauguration Indra conquered all conquerable
battle grounds ({#jitIH;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#jetavyAH sarvA yudDaBUmIH#}),
took possession of all worlds, obtained the highest dignity
amongst gods ({#SrEzWyam;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#atiSayena praSastatvam#}), trans-
cendent rank ({#atizWAm;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#sarvAnatikramyAvasTAnam#})
and preeminence ({#paramatAm;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#utkfzwatvam#}), conquered
righteous government, increase of enjoyment, absolute do-
minion, distinguished qualities, supreme abode, rulership
and mighty rule and mastership there; and thus he became
in this world a Prajāpati, an absolute king, long-lived
({#amftaH;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#itaramanuzyavadalpakAle maraRarahitaH#}), and
in the other world having obtained all his desires, he be-
came entirely exempt from death’ (or liberated; {#amftaH;#}
{%Sāy.:%} = {#maraRarahito muktaH#}).
<div n="P">The purpose for which the inauguration of a mortal king
takes place, is defined by the {%Aitar. Br.%} in precisely the
same terms as those contained in the preceding passage,
[with the obvious alteration of ‘amongst kings’ instead of
‘amongst gods’. This definition occurs ch. 39. 5.; in the
commencement of ch. 39. 1. the purpose of the ceremony is
worded somewhat differently at the end of the passage but
its bearing is similar, viz.: if he (i. e. a priest) wishes that
a king should conquer all conquerable battle grounds &c.

whole earth up to the ocean ({#pfTivyE samudraparyantAyA eka-#}
{#rAw#}), let him &c. &c…and: if a king wishes, that he
should conquer &c. &c., let him &c.].--The ceremony as
practised at the {%vaidik period,%} is thus described in the {%Ait.%}
{%Br.%} The priest in the commencement of the solemnity
causes the king to take the following oath: ‘if I (the king)
do ever harm to thee, thou (the priest) mayst deprive me
of all pious acts ({#izwApUrtam;#} {%Sāy.:%} {#SrOtasmArtadvayam#}) which
I have done from the time of my birth up to that of my
death, of heaven and whatever else good has been accom-
plished by me, of long life and offspring’. He then orders
his attendants to bring four kinds of fruits: the fruit of
the {%Nyagrodha%} (ficus Indica), of the {%Udumbara%} (ficus glo-
merata), of the {%Aśvattha%} (ficus religiosa) and of the {%Plaksha%}
(ficus infectoria); besides, four kinds of grain ({#OzaDAni#}
{#…tokmakftAni;#} {%Sāy.:%} {#aNkuranimittAnyOzaDidravyARi#}):
rice with small grain ({#vrIddIRAm;#} {%Sāy.:%} {#sUkzmavIjarUpA vrI-#}
{#hayaH#}), rice with large grain ({#mahAvrIhIRAm;#} {%Sāy.:%} {#prOQa-#}
{#vIjarUpA mahAvrIhayaH#}), {%Priyangu%} and barley. Next they
bring, at his command, a throne-seat of {%Udumbara%} wood
(made in the manner as described above, page 275{%a,%} line 34 ff.),
a (four-cornered) ladle of {%Udumbara%} or, instead of the latter,
a vessel of {%Udumbara%} (or, acc. to {%Sāyaṇa,%} an earthen vessel
of an arbitrary shape) and an {%Udumbara%} branch. Then they
put the four kinds of fruit and grain in the ladle or vessel
and pour over them curds, honey, clarified butter and water
proceeding from rain during sunshine, before it has fallen
down; afterwards, having placed the ladle or vessel on the
ground, they address the throne-seat with a Mantra which
recalls the component parts of Indra's throne and thus
tends to identify both: ‘may thy front legs be Bṛhat and
Rathantara &c. &c.; may Savitṛ and Bṛhaspati support
thy fore-legs &c. &c. (see above page 277{%b,%} line 1 ff.)’. Then
the priest asks the king to ascend the throne-seat, inviting
the Vasus, Rudras, Ādityas and the other divinities which
were invited by Indra at his inauguration (see page 277{%b,%}
line 31 ff.), to ascend his throne with the same metres, Stomas
and Sāmans and for the same purposes as mentioned above.
Upon this the relatives of the king (literally: ‘the king-
makers’, {#rAjakartAraH;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#pitfBrAtrAdayaH#} ‘father, bro-
ther &c.’), proclaim his high qualities in the same words
as the gods proclaimed the greatness of Indra; the priest
recites the {%Ṛgveda%}-verse 1. 25. 10. (with the same modifica-
tions as mentioned above) and, placing himself before the
throne with his face towards the west, covers the head of the
king with the Udumbara branch, the leaves of which have
been wetted, and with a gold Pavitra, and sprinkles him
with the liquid (in the ladle or vessel), while reciting the
three {%Ṛgveda%}-verses, the {%Yajurveda%}-verse and uttering the
[Page279-a+ 56]
three sacred words mentioned above (page 276{%a,%} line 22 ff.).
Lastly he addresses the king with the prayer that the Vasus,
the Rudras and the other divinities who performed this cere-
mony for Indra in the East, South &c. may severally do the
same for him in thirty-one successive days and to the same
effect as mentioned before (page 278{%a,%} line 1 ff.).--The in-
gredients of the sacred liquid used at this Abhisheka differ in
some measure, as will have been seen, from those used at
the {%Punarabhisheka;%} they differ from the latter also in their
typical qualities. The {%Nyagrodha%} being on account of its
wide spread the Rājan of the trees, and rice with small
grain being among plants principally productive of strength,
the fruit of the former and the grain of the latter are the
type of the qualities of a Kshatra ({#kzatram#}), which the king
is supposed to acquire by these ingredients; and in a si-
milar manner the fruit of the {%Udumbara%} and the grains of
{%Priyangu%} are the type of increase of enjoyment ({#BOjyam#}),
the fruit of the {%Aśvattha%} and rice with large grains the
type of righteous government ({#sAmrAjyam#}), the fruit of the
{%Plaksha%} the type of independent rule ({#svArAjyam#}) and at-
tainment of more distinguished qualities than those pos-
sessed by other kings ({#vErAjyam#}), barley the type of mi-
litary commandership ({#sEnAnyam#}); curds typify the sharpness
of senses ({#indriyam;#} {%Sāy.:%} ‘because they make the senses
sharp’: {#indriyapAwavahetutvAt#}), honey typifies the essence
of plants and trees ({#rasa ozaDivanaspatizu;#} {%Sāy.:%} ‘because
it originates in flowers’: {#puzpajanyatvena#}); clarified butter, the
brightness of cattle ({#tejaH paSUnAm;#} {%Sāy.:%} ‘on account of its
oily gloss’: {#snigDaBAskaratvena#}) and the water, freedom from
death or long life ({#amftam;#} {%Sāy.:%} ‘because it nourrishes’
{#ApyAyanahetutvAt#}).--The ceremony having been completed,
the king has to make a present to the inaugurating priest, viz.
a thousand (Nishkas) of gold, a field and cattle ({#catuzpAd;#}
{%Sāy.:%} {#gavAdikam#} cows &c.); but this amount seems merely
to constitute a minimum acknowledgement of the exertions
of the priest; for the text of the Aitareya adds that ‘they
say, a king should give innumerable, illimited presents,
since a king is illimited (in wealth) and thus will obtain
illimited benefit to himself’; and the author of the {%Aitar.%}
{%Br.%} seems rather inclined to adopt the latter opinion, for,
amongst the instances he gives of royal inaugurations which
have been performed in this fashion, he does not mention
such at which the Brāhmaṇas received the ‘limited’ gifts,
but tells, e. g., that {%Udamaya,%} the son of Atri, promised
to his priest ten thousand elephants and ten thousand
female slaves and gave each of the sons of that priest every
day at the noon-oblation two thousand cows out of a
thousand millions; that {%Anga%} gave his priest eighty thou-
sand young white horses fit for carrying burdens on their
back &c.; that {%Bharata%} distributed in Maṣṇāra a hundred
and seven thousand millions of black elephants with white
tucks and decked with gold &c. &c. (comp. also {%Colebr.%}
{%Ess.%} I. p. 41 ff.).--After the priest has received the gift,
he hands to the king a goblet of spirituous liquor in re-
citing the verse: ‘Soma with thy most sweet exhilarating
drops &c.’ (see above p. 276{%b,%} line 13ff.), and the king drinks
[Page279-b+ 56]
of it after having recited this verse: ‘what is left (in this
goblet) of the tasteful liquid and what Indra (drank when
it was consecrated by) various rites, that portion of it I
consume now with a placid mind, (as if it were) the royal
Soma’, and this verse: ‘to thee, supreme (Indra), I offer
this liquid for drink, for it has been poured out on thy
behalf, rejoice in it until thou art happy’; [the former of
these mantras occurs with a few variations in the {%Vājas.,%}
19. 35., the other in the {%Ṛgv.,%} 8. 45. 22. or {%Sāmav.,%} 1. 161.].
By this manner of drinking, the spirituous liquor becomes
a kind of Soma, and it is the Soma not the spirituous liquor
that is drunk by the king. Lastly the king recites the two
{%Ṛgveda%}-verses 8. 48. 3. and 4. [What follows in the text of
the {%Aitareya Br.%} up to the end of the 39<sup>th</sup> ch. are illustra-
tations of the happiness which is felt by a king in conse-
quence of such an inauguration, and historical instances of
kings who had this ceremony performed for them and be-
stowed liberal gifts on the functioning priests; for this
portion of the text compare also the literal translation of
it in {%Colebrooke'%}s {%Essays%} 1. p. 39 seqq.--
<div n="P">Inaugurations of a purely mythical nature are mentioned
in the {%Upanishads, Epic poems%} and in the {%Purāṇas;%} thus the
{%Harivaṇsa%} reports, ch. 109, an inauguration of {%Kṛṣṇa,%} the
{%Śalyap.%} of the {%Mahābh.,%} ch. 48, that of Varuṇa; a whole list
is given in the {%Vishnup.%} 1. ch. 22 (where a note of {%Wilson%}
refers to the corresponding passages in other {%Purāṇas%}); com-
pare also {%Bṛhadār. Up.%} 1. 4. 11. One of the completest lists
of this kind is that which occurs in the 4th chapter, and is
varied in the 227<sup>th</sup> chapter, of the {%Harivanśa.%} According to
the former, {%Soma%} was inaugurated as king of the Brāhmaṇas

the son of {%Rajas,%} of the West; and {%Hiraṇyaroman,%} the son
of {%Parjanya,%} of the North; all these kings inaugurated
{%Prīthu%} as king of kings.--The other list (ch. 227) is si-
milar, but it represents {%Śiva%} as becoming the inaugurated
king of the Piśāchas and other evil genii, of the Matṛs,
cows, meteors, planets, diseases, pests, calamities and

<div n="P">The type of the inauguration ceremony as practised at
the {%Epic period%} may probably be recognized in the history
of the inauguration of {%Rāma,%} as told in the {%Rāmāyaṇa,%}
and in that of the inauguration of {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} as told in
the {%Mahābhārata.%} Neither ceremony is described in these
poems with the full detail which is given of the vaidik rite
in the {%Aitar. Br.;%} but the allusion that {%Rāma%} was inau-
gurated by {%Vasiṣṭha%} and the other Brāhmaṇas in the same
manner as Indra by the Vasus ({%Yuddhakāṇḍa:%} {#vasizWo vA-#}
{#madevaSca#} &c. {#…aByaziYcannaravaraM prasannena suganDinA . sali-#}
{#lena sahasrAkzaM vasavo vAsavaM yaTA#}) and the observation which
is made in some passages that a certain rite of the inau-
guration was performed ‘according to the sacred rule’
({%Yuddhak.:%} {#SAstradfzwena viDinA sa tadA viDivaddvijaH rAGa-#}
{#vasyABizekArTaM sa dvijeByo nyavedayat;#} {%Śāntiparv.:%} {#juhAva pA-#}
{#bakaM DImAnviDimantrapuraskftam#} or {#pUjayAmAsa tAMScApi viDi-#}
{#vadBUridakziRaH#}), admit of the conclusion that the ceremony
was supposed to have taken place in conformity with the
vaidik injunction. This inference is confirmed moreover
by another passage of the {%Śāntīp.%} (v. 2496) which says
‘that inaugurating a king is a chief duty of the people of
a country…for the Veda states: because they chose
Indra for their king &c…’ ({#rAzwrasyEtatkftyatamaM rAjYa evA-#}
{#Bizecanam…indrameva pravfRute yadrAjAnamiti SrutiH#} &c.;
{%Arjunam.%} {#rAzwrasya = asya deSavAsino lokasya#}). Yet it re-
sults from the description given in the Epic poems that the
vaidik ceremony had undergone various modifications at
the time of their composition.--As the inauguration of
{%Rāma%} was intended and the necessary preparations for it
were made, when his father {%Daśaratha%} was still alive, but
as the ceremony itself, through the intrigues of his step-
mother {%Kaikeyī,%} did not take place then, but fourteen years
later, after the death of {%Daśaratha,%} an account of the pre-
[Page280-b+ 56]
paratory ceremonies is given in the {%Ayodhyākāṇda%} as well
as in the {%Yuddhakāṇḍa%} of the Rāmāyaṇa, but an account
of the complete ceremony in the latter book alone. Accord-
ing to the {%Ayodhyāk.%} on the day preceding the intended inau-
guration {%Rāma%} and his wife {%Sītā%} held a fast, and in the night
they performed this preliminary rite: {%Rāma,%} having made
his ablutions, approached the idol of Nārāyaṇa, took a
cup of clarified butter, as the religious law prescribes ({#vi-#}
{#Divat#}), made a libation of it into the kindled fire and drank
the remainder while wishing what was agreeable to his
heart. Then, with his mind fixed on the divinity, he lay,
silent and composed, together with {%Sītā,%} on a bed of Kuśa-
grass, which was spread before the altar of Viṣṇu, until
the last watch of the night, when he awoke and ordered
the palace to be prepared for the solemnity. At day-break,
reminded of the time by the voices of the bards, he per-
formed the usual morning devotion and praised the divinity.
In the mean time the town Ayodhyā had assumed a festive
appearance and the inauguration implements had been ar-
ranged: a beautiful golden throne-seat ({#BadrAsana#} or {#siM-#}
{#hAsana,#} also called in other passages {#BadrapIWa;#} the vaidik
term is {#AsandI#}) covered with a tiger-skin, water taken
from the confluence of the Ganges and Jumna as well as from
other sacred rivers in all directions and from all oceans,
golden jars filled with shoots of the {%Udumbara%} tree and
various lotus flowers ({#padmotpala#}), {%Ruchakas%} (citrons?) and
{%Rochanas%} (pomegranates?), clarified butter, honey, milk,
curd, as well as soil, water and other propitious objects
taken from places of pilgrimage ({#tIrTa#}), a white pearl
sceptre, a {%chowri%} ({#cAmara#}), a fan, and a white parasol
decorated with beautiful garlands; besides, a white bull, a
white horse and a splendid, furious elephant ({#matto gajavaraH#}),
also eight beautiful damsels in fine attire, all kinds of mu-
sical instruments and bards in festive dress. [This is the
account according to the text of the {%Rāmāyaṇa%} in Mr. {%Gor-%}
{%resio'%}s edition; the edition of {%Schlegel,%} mentions (2. 15. 4-12)
the following implements and in the following order: golden
waterjars, an ornamented throne-seat, a chariot covered
with a splendid tiger-skin, water taken from the confluence
of the Ganges and Jumna, as well as from other sacred
rivers, tanks, wells, lakes and from all oceans, honey,
curd, clarified butter, fried grain ({#lAjAH#}), Kuśa grass,
flowers, milk; besides, eight beautiful damsels and a splen-
did, furious elephant; golden and silver jars, filled with
water, covered with {%Udumbara%} branches ({#kzIriBiSCannAH#})
and various lotus flowers; besides a white, jewelled {%chowrie%}
({#bAlavyajana#}), a white splendid parasol, a white bull, a
white horse, all manners of musical instruments and bards.
A similar enumeration occurs in the preceding chapter
v. 32 ff. of the same edition where the throne-seat is defined
as ‘made of {%Udumbara%} wood’, the chariot as ‘drawn by
four horses’, the bull as ‘accoutred with golden ropes, full-
grown (lit. having its hump) and white’, and the horse as
‘strong and having four large teeth’; there are mentioned
also {%two%} white {%chowries,%} instead of one, and all kinds
of seeds, perfumes and jewels, a scimitar ({#nistriMSa#}), a
[Page281-a+ 56]
bow, a litter ({#vAhanaM narasaMyuktam;#} comm. = {#SivikAdi#}), a gol-
den vase ({#BfNgAraM hiraRmayam#}) and a blazing fire, and amongst
the living implements of the pageant, instead of the bards,
gaudy courtezans, and besides the eight damsels: ‘profes-
sors of divinity ({#AcAryAH#}), Brāhmaṇas, cows and pure
kinds of wild beasts and birds, the chiefs of town-and
country-people and the citizens with their train’.--The
whole passage however (2. 14. 32-39.) seems to be an inter-
polation in the speech of {%Vasiṣṭha,%} at variance with the
hurry of his message to the king and made superfluous
by the narrative of the following chapter.] The {%Yuddha-%}
{%kāṇḍa%} mentions of implements only a jewelled throne-seat
({#ratnamayaM pIWam#}) and four golden jars ornamented with
jewels in which four monkey chiefs, the allies of {%Rāma%} in
his war against {%Rāvaṇa,%} carried water from the ocean of
the four regions; {%Ṛṣabha%} carried it from the southern
ocean, his jar being filled with red sandal branches, {%Jāmbavat%}
from the western ocean, his jar being ornamented with aloe
shoots; {%Vegadarśin%} from the northern ocean, his jar being
decorated with large branches (of what tree, is not said),
and {%Suṣeṇa%} from the eastern ocean, his jar being orna-
mented with bracelets ({#? aNgadakeyUrEH#}).--Of the ceremony
itself it is said that it was performed in the fashion of
Indra's inauguration, but a first difference which, to judge
from the scanty detail of the text, appears to exist between
the manner in which the ceremony was conducted at the
epic and that in which it is conducted in the vaidik period,
is that the wife of Rāma shares in a portion of the cere-
monies and in a seat on the throne with her husband, while
a participation of the wife of the king in the ceremony is
not mentioned in the {%Aitar. Br.;%} and a second and still
more important difference results from the circumstance that
not merely {%Vasiṣṭha,%} the officiating priest, sprinkled Rāma
with the consecrated liquid, but after him ‘{%Vāmadeva, Jā-%}
{%bāli, Vijaya, Kāśyapa, Gotama, Kātyāyana, Viśvāmitra%} and
other eminent Brāhmaṇas; moreover, after them, in suc-
cession, the assistant priests, the damsels, the military
chiefs and the citizens, the gods shedding over him from
the sky the essence of all plants’; for although the Vasus
and other gods sprinkled Indra with the liquid, to inau-
gurate him as king of the several heavenly quarters, no
mention is made in the vaidik ceremony, as applied to a
mortal king, that any one else but the officiating priest
inaugurated the king with the sacred liquid, or that the
active share of the assembly in the ceremony goes beyond
their eulogizing the good qualities of the king. A com-
parison, besides, between the implements of inauguration
at the two periods and between the ingredients which con-
stitute the consecration-liquid of the vaidik and that of
the epic ceremony, show that the typical quality of the
former had, in a great measure, been lost sight of at the
period of the epic poems.--The same and other de-
viations are apparent in the account which is given in
the {%Śāntiparvan%} of the {%Mahābhārata,%} of {%Yudhisṭhira'%}s inau-
guration: ‘Free from anger and pain the royal son of {%Kuntī%}
sat down joyfully on the golden throne-seat ({#paramAsana#}),
[Page281-b+ 56]
his face turned towards the east; in front of him took their
seat on a beautiful golden stool ({#pIWa#}) the valiant {%Sātyaki%} and
{%Vāsudeva;%} at either side of him, on fine-shaped jewelled
stools the noble {%Bhīmasena%} and {%Arjuna;%} on a sumptuous
ivory throne-seat embellished with gold (but acc. to a comm.
‘on a sumptuous {%solid%} throne-seat’; {#dAnte siMhAsane,#} {%Arju-%}
{%nam.:%} {#dAnte saMharzakzame#}), {%Prithā%} with {%Sahadeva%} and {%Nakula,%}
and on seats as brilliant as fire separately {%Sudharman%} (the
priest of Duryodhana) {%Vidura, Dhaumya%} and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%}
as well as the pugnacious {%Sanjaya%} and the illustrious
{%Gāndhārī,%} all entering from the side whence came {%Dhṛta-%}
{%rāṣṭra.%} But the righteous king having taken his seat,
touched with his fingers white flowers, auspicious emblems
({#svastikAn#}), fried grain ({#akzatAn#}), the soil, gold, silver
and a pearl; when all his subjects, headed by the house
priest, became aware that he had thus possessed himself in
an auspicious manner of earth, gold and the various kinds of
jewels. The implements of the inauguration prepared and
ready, were: filled jars made of gold, {%Udumbara%} wood,
silver and clay, flowers, fried grain ({#lAjAH#}), sacrificial
grass ({#barhis#}), cow's milk, fuel of {%Śami%} (Acacia suma)-,
{%Aśvattha%} (Ficus religiosa)-, and {%Palāśa%} (Butea frondosa)-
wood, honey and clarified butter, a ladle ({#Sruva#}) made of
{%Udumbara%}-wood, and a conch ({#SaNKa#}) ornamented with gold.
Then, in obedience to the orders of {%Kṛṣṇa, Dhaumya,%} the
family priest, marked the sacrificial ground with a line in
the direction of north-east ({#prAgudakplavane vedIM lakzaRenopaliKya#}
{#ca#}), requested the noble king and the dark daughter of
{%Drupada%} to be seated on the white, solid-legged throne-seat
({#sarvatoBadra Asane;#} comp. {#BadrAsana, BadrapIWa#}) which was
brilliant like fire and covered over with a tiger-skin, and
made a libation into fire while reciting the appropriate
mantras ({#juhAva pAvakaM DImAnviDimantrapuraskftam#}). Upon
this {%Kṛṣṇa%} took his venerated conch and sprinkled (with
its contents) {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} the son of Kuntī, (inaugurating
him thus) as lord of the earth, and after him {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%}
the royal Ṛṣi (sprinkled the king) and then all his sub-
jects’.--The present made at this occasion by {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%} consisted of a thousand Nishkas he gave to the
Brāhmaṇas (somewhat in conformity with the injunction of
the {%Aitar. Br.%}); but the liberality of {%Rāma%} was more re-
markable: he gave the Brāhmaṇas a million milch cows,
ten thousand bulls and three hundred millions Nishkas, be-
sides carts, ornaments, cloths, beds and seats, and nu-
merous villages; he made liberal presents, too, to the
monkey chiefs and the monkeys, his allies.--It is, worthy
of note, that a custom is met with, in the epic poems, the
origin of which cannot with certainty be traced to the in-
junctions of the {%Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,%} viz. a king's having a son
or relative of his inaugurated as {#yuvarAja#} (also {#yuvarAjan#}) or
‘junior king’. For, although {%Sāyaṇa'%}s commentary speaks
of ‘a father, brother &c.’ who eulogize the king before the
priest sprinkles him with the sacred liquid, and although the
presence of the father at the ceremony {%might%} countenance
the inference that the vaidik text implies also the inau-
guration of a {%Yuvarāja,%} it must be observed that the text
[Page282-a+ 56]
of the Brāhmaṇa does not contain the quoted words
but in their stead the term {#rAjakartAraH#} ‘king-makers’,
which may or may not comprise the paternal relationship.
On the other hand it must be admitted that the vaidik in-
junction is not at variance with this ceremony, which, once
performed, seems to hold good for the inauguration of the
prince at his accession to the throne, after the father's
death, since no mention is made, in the epic poems, of a
repetition of the ceremony. The object of the inauguration
of a prince as {%Yuvarāja%} is to secure to him the right of
succession, and, besides, the advantages supposed to arise
from the religious ceremony, as mentioned before, a share
in the government, or perhaps all the privileges of a
reigning king. For when {%Daśaratha%} intends to make his
son {%Rāma%} a {%Yuvarāja,%} he addresses him with these words
(in the {%Āyodhyākāṇḍa%}): ‘Rāma, I am old; I have lived
long and enjoyed every pleasure I desired; hundreds of
sacrifices I have performed when I distributed food and
liberal presents; thou wast born the son of my desire, for
no one is equal to thee on earth; thus I have paid my
debt to the gods, the Ṛṣis, my deceased ancestors, the
Brāhmaṇas and my own self; nothing remains for me to
be done save inaugurating thee; therefore what I am about
to tell thee, thou must do. To day all my subjects want
thee for their king; therefore, my son, I shall inaugurate
thee as junior king’; and {%Rāma%} reports to his mother:
‘mother, I am ordered by my father to undertake the
government of the country; to-morrow my inauguration
will take place, for such is the behest of my father’. An-

<div n="P">The inauguration ceremony at the {%Paurāṇic%} period has
but little affinity with the vaidik rite; it is a series of pro-
ceedings which are founded on late superstitions and reflect
scarcely any of the ideas which are the groundwork of the
ceremony of the {%Aitar. Br.%} A description--though a
loose and desultory one--of the {%Paurāṇic Abhisheka%} oc-
curs in the 209<sup>th</sup> chapter of the {%Agni-Purāṇa.%} It commences
with the injunction that a king should before his inaugura-
tion choose his astrologer ({#sAMvatsara#}), his family-priest
({#purohita#}), his officiating-priest ({#ftvij#}), his ministers
({#mantrin#}) and his queen ({#mahizI#}). [Comp. {%Manu%} 7. 77 &c.]
The astrologer fixes the proper time for the inauguration
(comp. page 284{%b,%} line 51 ff.); the king takes a bath prepared
with Sesamum and white mustard seeds ({#tilEH sidDArTakEH#}
{#snAnam#}); the astrologer and the family-priest hail the king
with the cry of ‘victory’, and he being seated on a throne-
seat ({#BadrAsana#}) makes a proclamation of peace or public
safety and grants freedom to his prisoners. Then before
his inauguration by the family-priest takes place, he ad-
dresses a propitiatory prayer to Indra, and fasting on the
[Page282-b+ 56]
day of the inauguration makes libations to the Manus &c. (?)
and pays respect to a sacrificial jar which is placed on the
right or southern side of the sacrificial fire, with perfumes
and flowers. [The text of this passage in the two Mss. of
the {%Agni-P.%} at London, that alone contain a description of
the ceremony and could be consulted by me, is very cor-
rupt; the Ms. of the Royal As. Soc. in Devan. char. reads:

at the same time, as a specimen of the indifferent state of
both Mss.--that of the R. S. being however the better
of the two--which made it necessary to renounce a
{%literal%} translation of the {%whole%} chapter.] The flame of this
fire should go rightwards, it should be bright like melted
gold, crackle like carts or thunder(?), be clear (or smoke-
less), scent the air, be like the sign Swastika, have an
uninterrupted, large flame and be free from sparks; no
cats, wild beasts or birds should pass over the sacrificial
ground [Mss.: {#pradakziRAvartaSiKastu taptajAmbunadapraBaH . raTO-#}

The king, to prepare himself for the inauguration, purifies
his head with soil taken from the top of a mountain, his
ears with soil from the top of an ant-hill ({#valmIkAgramfdA#}),
his mouth with soil from a temple of Viṣṇu, his neck with
soil from a temple of Indra, his breast with soil from a
royal court yard ({#nfpAjirAt#}), his right arm with soil thrown
up by the horns of a bull ({#vfzaSfNgodDftamfdA#}), his back with
soil from a lake, his belly with soil from the two banks
of a river, his hips with soil taken from the door of a brothel
({#veSyAdvAramfdA rAjYaH kawiSOcaM viDIyate#}), his thighs with
soil from a sacrificial spot ({#yajYasTAnAt;#} but Ms. R. A. S. from
a cowpen: {#gosTAnAt,#} which word however occurs im-
mediately again), his knees with soil from a cowpen, his
legs with soil from a horse-stable, his feet with soil from
a cart-wheel; and the soil itself he washes off with {%Pancha-%}
{%gavya%} (a compound of five articles derived from the cow:
milk, curd, clarified butter, cow's urine and cow-dung). After
this purification four ministers sprinkle the king who is
seated on the throne: first the Brāhmaṇa minister with
clarified butter out of a golden jar which stands east of the
throne, then the Kshatriya minister with milk out of a
silver jar which stands south, next the Vaiśya minister
with curds out of a copper jar which stands west, and
lastly the Śūdra minister with water out of an earthen jar
which stands north of the throne [{#…BadrAsanagataM nfpam .#}

Ṛgveda sprinkles him with honey and one who knows
how to chant the Sāmaveda with Kuśagrass-water. Then
the family-priest goes to the golden jar (mentioned above
page 282{%b,%} line 2) and commits the sacrificial fire in the
prescribed manner and with the appropriate hymns to the
care of the Brāhmaṇas who assist him. [Ms. R. S.: {#saMpI-#}

done so, he repairs to the part of the sacrificial ground
where the throne stands (?, liter. to the {#vedimUlam,#} root
of the sacrificial ground), and sprinkles the head of the
king with the liquid out of a golden vase perforated with
hundreds of holes while reciting verses referring to the sub-
stances which together with water, constitute the liquid,
viz. herbs, perfumes, flowers, seeds, jewels (or pearls,
probably reduced to powder) and Kuśagrass; and his throat
(Ms. R. A. S.: his hip) with water taken from various
places of pilgrimage and mixed with Rochanā; the Brāhma-
ṇas holding before the king, while the music plays, the
jar which contains the annuals, together with the {%chowrie,%}
the fan and the other emblems of royalty. [The greater
portion of the passage describing this rite is again so cor-

butter and other auspicious objects placed before a looking
glass (? comp. page 286{%a,%} line 29), his family-priest, after a
prayer to Viṣṇu, Brahman and other divinities and having
prepared dishes of curds, clarified butter, honey &c., binds
the head of the king with a fillet and fastens on it the
tiara, while the king is seated on a couch covered over
with a tiger-skin. He then orders a (white?) bull, a white
horse (?) and an elephant to be led in, caparisoned severally
with a panther- (?), a lion-and a tiger-skin. [Mss.: {#taM#}

Presently the door-keeper ushers in the ministers, coun-
sellors &c.; the king presents the astrologer and the family-
priest with cows, goats, sheep and similar gifts, offers to
the other Brāhmaṇas gold and such like presents, circum-
ambulates the fire in keeping his right side towards it and
makes a bow before his Guru. He further salutes respect-
fully the bull, in patting it on the back, also the elephant,
which he does not mount; but the horse he mounts, and
having rode on it round his city (in keeping his right side
towards it), while the royal passage is lined with soldiers,
he enters it and dismisses gracefully all the people with
marks of his favour. [The Ms. of the R. S. however con-
denses the latter passage thus: ‘the door-keeper ushers in
the ministers, counsellors &c. and he dismisses gracefully
all the people with gifts of cows, goats, sheep &c.’;

to be recited at the inauguration ({#rAjadevAdyaBizekamantrAnvakzye#}
{#'GamardanAn . kumBAtkuSodakEH#})--R. A. S.: {#kumBAnkumBodakEH--#}
{#siYcettena saMrvaM hi siDyati#}). These {%mantras%} have nothing in
common with those recited at the vaidik ceremony; they
contain merely an enumeration of gods, demons, saints,
mountains, rivers &c. even of literary works, which are
asked to sprinkle the king, to grant him victory and to
protect him; the order in which all these beings and objects
are paraded, is of the same senseless kind, and the nomen-
clature of the same tedious description as they not uncom-
conly occur in those works which exhibit a caricature of
the ancient Hindu religion,--in the Purāṇas. It will suf-
fice to give as a specimen the following verses of the forty
and some Ślokas which form the subject of this chapter:
‘may the gods sprinkle thee, and Brahman, Viṣṇu, Śiva,
Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna, Aniruddha; may the
ten elephants of the regions give thee victory, and Rudra,
Dharma, Daksha, the Sun, religious Belief ({#SradDA#}), Bhṛgu,

The Sanskṛt works which are invoked to protect the king
stand, in the text, between the mountains and the oceans,
in the following order and selection: the Ṛg-and the other
Vedas, the six Angas, Itihāsas and Purāṇas, the Upa-
vedas, viz. Āyurveda, Gandharvaveda, and Dhanurveda,
the Angas, viz. Śikṣā, Kalpa, Vyākaraṇa, Nirukta, the
science of the luminous bodies ({#jyotizAM gatiH#}) and
Chhandas [see s. v. {#aNga#}], the Vedas [here mentioned again,
like the Angas], the Mīmānsā-and Nyāya-systems ({#mI-#}
{#mAMsAnyAyavistaraH#}), and the old Dharmaśāstra ({#DarmaSAstraM#}
{#purARaM ca#}); for these are the fourteen sciences [i. e. the four
Vedas, the six Angas, the Purāṇas as eleventh, the Mī-
mānsā, Nyāya and law]; the Sāṅkhya-and Yoga-systems,
the system of the Pāsupatas, the Vedānta and the system
of the Pāñcharātras ({#pASupataM vedASca#}--sic--{#pAYcarAtrakam#}),
for these are the five doctrines; the auspicious verse Gā-

<div n="P">Another account of a royal inauguration, which is si-
milar to that of the Agni-Purāṇa and perhaps belongs to
a still more recent period than the latter, is that of the
{%Mānasāra,%} a work on Architecture and reputedly the com-
pletest of its kind. [The high antiquity which is ascribed
by the Hindus to this work will become more than doubt-
ful, from a comparison, for instance, of this portion of it
with the 209<sup>th</sup> ch. of the Agni-P. The only Ms. of this
work, I could consult, is hopelessly incorrect and does
not permit to make a reliable translation of it; it is a copy
[Page284-b+ 56]
of an ancient Ms. in Tamul characters which was discovered
at Trichinopoly, is imperfect at the beginning and at the
end, was written out under the direction of Mr. Ch. P.
Brown and is now in possession of the E. I. H.; its ex-
treme rareness in India as well as in Europe makes it ad-
viseable to draw attention to some particulars of its de-
scription of a royal inauguration which may be rendered
in a safe manner.] The {%Mānasāra%} puts forward two per-
sonages in the inauguration ceremony who do not make
their appearance in the foregoing accounts: the {%Sthapati%} or
the architect, and the {%Sthāpaka%} or (probably) the master
of the ceremonies. According to this work, the throne is
placed in a handsome sacrificial building where the inau-
guration takes place ({#yAgamaRqape sOmye tu siMhAsanasya co-#}
{#pari . nfpAlaM tatra saMsTApya aBizekaM samAraBet;#} some such
building seems to be implied also by the description of the
Agni-Purāṇa, since a ‘door-keeper’ is mentioned, but it
is not expressedly named); the inauguration liquid, which
consists of river and sea-water is consecrated by chanting
hymns from the Atharvaveda, Sāmaveda and other sacred
works; ({#saritsamudrasalilakumBEH pUrRavimADavEH#} ({%sic%}) {#. aTarva-#}
{#sAmagItESca cAnyEScAgamamantrakEH#}); the king marks his fore-
head with the sign Tripuṇḍra (q. v.: {#paScAttu homanizWAM ca#}
{#darBaM dattvA tripuRqrakam . lalAwasAraRaM kuryAdBUpatistu yaTAvi-#}
{#Di#}), anoints his body with sandal and saffron, and the
{%Sthapati%} purifies him with the compound called {%Pancha-%}
{%gavya%} (see above page 282{%b,%} line 45); them the family-priest
places on his head the tiara, and this toilet being com-
pleted, the {%Sthapati%} and the {%Sthāpaka%} invite the king to
take place, with his queen, on the throne when the sacred
liquid is sprinkled on his forehead while he bears the
jewelled tiara ({#ratnasaMtuzwamukuwamUrDvaM rAjopaDArayet#}). This
ceremony having been performed under ‘benedictions and
all manner of auspicious noises’ ({#sarvamaNgalaGozESca svastivA-#}
{#canapUrvavat#}) the king mounts on an elephant and, under the
sounds of a similar music, rides round his city, keeping
his right side towards it, and distributes gifts amongst the
spectators ({#kuryAdArohaRaM paScAdrAjA tvErAvatopari . nagarI-#}
{#pradakziRaM kuryAtsarvamaNgalaGozakEH#}). These gifts which consist
in corn and the like, cow's and other milk, weapons, and
generally in any thing whether auspicious or not, the king
should throw before himself and touch with his own hand,
for in doing so he will not merely acquire strength, victory
and glory but abundance of food &c. [A modern treatise on
the royal inauguration, called {%Rājyābhiṣekapaddhati,%}--with-
out either date or name of the author--is very prolix in the
enumeration of the mantras; it quotes the {%Śatapathabr.%} and,
among the Purāṇas, chiefly the {%Agni-P.;%} but it is rather
an uncritical compilation from various books, than an au-
thoritative source of information.]
<div n="P">The {%time of the inauguration%} must be an auspicious one.
{%Rāma%} was inaugurated when the moon entered the asterism
{%Pushya,%} in the hour {%Abhijit;%} ({%Yuddhak.:%} {#tataH praBAte vimale#}
{#muhUrte'Bijiti praBuH . vasizWaH puzyayogena brAhmaREH parivA-#}
{#ritaH . rAmaM ratnamaye pIWe…upaveSya#} &c.).--The {%Agni-P.%}
merely forbids the inauguration to take place at night
[Page285-a+ 56]
time, but makes no further restriction ({#sAMvatsaro nfpaM kAle#}
{#sasaMBAro'Bizecanam . kuryAdfte rAtrikAlaM kAlasya niyamaH#}
{#smftaH#}).--According to the astrological work {%Jyotishara-%}
{%tnamālā,%} the inauguration of a king may take place when
the moon enters either of the following asterisms: {%Anu-%}
{%rādhā%} (17<sup>th</sup> ), {%Hasta%} (13<sup>th</sup> ), {%Pushya%} (8<sup>th</sup> ), {%Rohiṇi%} (4<sup>th</sup> ), {%Śra-%}
{%vaṇa%} (23<sup>d</sup> ) and the three next to it (viz. {%Dhaniṣṭhā, Śata-%}
{%bhiṣā, Pūrvabhādrapadā%}), {%Revatī%} (28<sup>th</sup> ), {%Mṛgaśiras%} (5<sup>th</sup> )
or {%Aśvinī%} (1<sup>st</sup> ); ({#mEtraSAkrakarapuzyarohiRIvEzRavezu tisfzUttarAsu#}
{#ca . revatImfgaSiro'SvinIzvapi kzmABujAM samaBizeka izyate#}).--
Another astrological work, the {%Muhūrtachintāmaṇī,%} lays
down the following rules: ‘the inauguration of a king is
auspicious, if it takes place at the period of the sun's pro-
gress to the north of the equator, when Jupiter, the Moon
and Venus have risen or those powerful planets: Mars, the
Sun, the predominant or the minor planet which rule the
(king's) nativity; but {%not%} on the fourth, ninth or fourteenth
day of the month Chaitra, on a Tuesday, during the night
or in an intercalary month. If it is performed at the
conjunction of ill-omened planets with the first asterism
(reckoned from that under which the king is born) their
influence brings him illness; with the eighth, death; with
the fifth, affliction of his sons; with the twelfth, poverty;
with the tenth, it deprives him of energy; with the seventh
or fourth, it destroys his sovereign power. All is au-
spicious, however, if an auspicious planet enters into the
circle. If Jupiter enters into conjunction with the ninth
or fifth asterism (reckoned from that under which the king
is born) or Mars with the sixth, or Venus with the tenth,
the king will always enjoy royal happiness; if Saturn
enters into conjunction with the third, the Sun with the
eleventh or Jupiter with the tenth or fourth asterism (and
the inauguration then takes place), his empire will remain
firm’; [{#rAjABizekaH SuBa uttarAyaRe gurvinduSukrEruditErbalA-#}

text (as results from the last quotation) professes at least
that they are analogous to those at the inauguration
of {%Varuṇa%} as king of the waters, and at the latter cere-
mony (mentioned {%Śalyap.%} chap. 48) reference is made to the
inauguration of {%Indra,%} which is the type of a royal inau-
guration; ({#varuRaM devatAH sarvAH sametyedamaTAbruvan . yaTAsmA-#}

have been that difference, however, that the military com-
mander, his installation having been performed, did not
give but receive presents, for the {%Mahābh.%} exhibits a long
list of presents that were offered to {%Kārtikeya%} by the gods
who assisted at his consecration.--The time deemed au-
spicious or inauspicious is the same for the inauguration
of a military chief as for that of a king, except that {%Tuesday%}
is considered also amongst the lucky days of the former,
Mars being himself a military chief; (according to {%Daiva-%}

<div n="P">5. Washing the image of a divinity, purifying it with
ablutions. This ceremony takes place either at a festival
[Page286-a+ 56]
held in honour of a divinity or at the installation of an
idol as a domestic and tutelary divinity; it consists in
rubbing it over with ointments and washing it with liquids
prepared of different substances under the recital of appro-
priate mantras. (According to the given quotation from
the {%Agni-Pur.,%} the invocations mentioned in the latter, are
the same for the consecration of an idol as for that of a
king.) At the {%Dola%} festival held in honour of the juvenile
{%Kṛṣṇa%} the following materiels are used, according to the
{%Utkalakhaṇḍa%} (as quoted by {%Rādhākāntadeva%}): cold water,
cow-dung, cow's urine, cow's milk, curds, clarified butter
(i. e. the five substances of the Panchagavya), infusions of
Kuśa-grass ({#kuSodakam#}), of Śaṅkha (a perfume, apparently
a dried shell-fish; {#SaNKodakam#}), of sandal ({#candanodakam#}),
of saffron ({#kuNkumodakam#}), of fruits and flowers ({#Paloda-#}
{#kam#} and {#puzpodakam#}), an unguent prepared of the powder
of sandal wood and of emblic myrobalan ({#candanapizwAma-#}
{#lakyudvartanam#}); scented water ({#suganDijalam#}) with which the
idol is washed eight times, milk, clarified butter and honey
being added severally at the second, seventh and eighth
ablution; an infusion of perfumes ({#ganDodakam#}) with which
five ablutions are made; water taken from places of pil-
grimage ({#tIrTajalam#}), Ganges-water, water proceeding from
an ant-hill, infusion of small annuals ({#sarvOzaDijalam#}),
Sahasradhārā-water ({#sahasraDArAjalam#}), various kinds of
water in jars (according to some, in 108 jars).--At the
{%Durgā%} festival, according to the {%Vṛhannandikeśvara-Purāṇa%}
(also quoted by {%Rādhāk.%}) the image of the goddess is rubbed
over before a looking glass ({#darpaRapratibimbe#}) with an oint-
ment prepared of turmeric and powder of emblic myro-
balan and then washed with the following things one after
the other, under the recital of mantras, with: pure water,
an infusion of Śaṅkha, Ganges-water, an infusion of per-
fumes, each article of the Panchagavya (successively, as
mentioned before), an infusion of Kuśa-grass, Pañchāmṛta
(a mixture of milk, curds, sugar, clarified butter and honey),
ice-water, honey, an infusion of flowers, sea-water mixed
with the juice of the sugar-cane ({#ikzurasasAgarodake#}), an
infusion of small and large annuals mixed together ({#sarvO-#}
{#zaDimahOzaDijalam#}), water containing five kinds of extracts
({#paYcakazAyodakam#}), eight sorts of earth ({#azwamfttikAH?#} pro-
bably {#azwO mf°#}), infusion of fruits, hot water, Sahasra-
dhārā-water, various kinds of water in eight jars, viz.
atmospheric water in one jar ({#vyomagaNgAmbupUrRAdyakalasaH#}),
cloud-water in a second ({#meGatoyapUrRa°#}), water of the Sara-
svatī in a third ({#sArasvatatoyapUrRa°#}), sea-water in a fourth
({#sAgarodakapUrRa°#}), water mixed with lotus-pollen ({#padmareRu-#}
{#miSritajalapUrRa°#}) in a fifth, cascade-water in a sixth ({#nirjJa-#}
{#rodakapUrRa°#}), water from various places of pilgrimage in a
seventh ({#sarvatIrTAmbupUrRa°#}) and pure water in an eighth jar
{#SudDajalapUrRAzwamakalasaH#}). Besides these substances, other ri-
tual works mention: river-water, infusions of cocoa-nuts and
of (pounded) pearls, rain-water, infusions of camphor and
of sandal, aloe, gold, silver, {%Gorochanā,%} saffron, {%Śrīphala,%}
corn, Dūb-grass, sugar, lake-water, Ganges-and sea-water
mixed together, an infusion of five kinds of grain ({#paYca-#}

ing to some, earth stirred up by the teeth of an elephant,
earth from a river, from its two banks, from a town-gate
({#nAgaramfttikA#}), from a cowpen and a trivium; others
name infusions of the five articles of Pañchāmṛta severally,
of the small and the large annuals severally ({#savOzaDi-#}
{#mahOzaDI pfTak#}), of the five kinds of extracts severally, or
infusions only of two articles of the Pañchāmṛta (viz.
honey, butter and milk excepted); again some name an
ointment made of turmeric only, some one prepared of
sesamum-oil and turmeric, and others add an aromatic
powder and one made of five kinds of grain. In the ritual
works founded on the {%Kālī-%} and {%Devī-Purāṇas%} there are men-
tioned, besides, infusions of (pounded) corals, emeralds, ru-
bies, pearls, lapis lazuli, several varieties of lotusses ({#padma,#}

{%Purāṇas%} mention moreover eight melodies which are se-
verally played when the idol is washed with the eight kinds
of water in the eight jars (see above col. {%a,%} line 43), as
well as the instruments with which they are played. At
the washing with the atmospheric water the melody is (acc.
to the ritual of the {%Vṛhannandikeśvara-Pur.%}) {%Mālasī,%} played

s. v. {#aBizeka#}.--At the installation of a domestic idol
({#devapratizWA#}) the following articles are recommended for
the ablution by the {%Devapratiṣṭhatattva%} (as quoted by
{%Rādhāk.%}): river-, torrent-, sea-, cascade- and cloud-water,
a mixture of milk, curds, sugar, clarified butter and honey,
{%Panchagavya%} mixed with an infusion of Kuśa-grass; earth
stirred up by the hoofs of a horse and the teeth of an ele-
phant, earth from a mountain, from Kuśa-grass and an
ant-hill, sesamum-oil, clarified butter, an infusion of five
extracts ({#paYcakazAyodakam#}), flowers of the mango-tree, of
the {%Champaka%} (Michelia champaca), of the Acacia suma,
lotusses and Oleander; leaves of holy basil, jasmin and
{%Śṛphala%} (Ægle marmelos.), a cleansing powder prepared
either of the refuse of Sesamum ({#tilakalka#}), or of rice
({#SAlitaRqula#}), or of {%Vilwa%} (Ægle marmelos.) -leaves, or of
emblic myrobalan ({#Amalaka#}); hot water, water from places
of pilgrimage. To prepare the liquid either a hundred and
eight, or fifty four, or twenty jars are required, or one
jar may suffice; the water is taken in the proportion of
a hundred and eight Pala-weight--such is the vaidik (!)
quantity--or, commonly, in the proportion of three
hundred and sixty Tola-weight, and the substances named
are mixed and shaken with it in each jar separately.--
If a person, however, cannot afford to provide all these
articles, he may take merely earth from an ant-hill, new
cowdung, dry cowdung, some water mixed with ashes and
scented water. (Comp. {%Rādhāk., Śabdak.%} s. v.).--E. {#sic#}
