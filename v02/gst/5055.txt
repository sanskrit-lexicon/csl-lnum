{#apAkartos#}¦ Tatpur. (ved.) The same as {#apAkartum#} of the
classical dialect, i. e. to drive away, to remove. E. The
genitive of an obsolete noun {#apAkartu,#} the accus. of which
is alone used, as in all similar cases, in the sense of our
infinitive in the classical dialect; the native etym. expresses
this thus: {#kf#} with {#A#} and {#apa,#} kṛt aff. {#tosun,#} to indicate
that the udātta accent is on {#apa#} i. e. on the first syllable.
