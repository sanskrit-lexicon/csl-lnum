<div n="P">This word occurs only as the latter part of several,
in most instances irregular compounds, the former part of
which is, in the classic dialect, restricted to some prepo-
sitions and indeclinables; see f. i. {#avAYc-udaYc-nyaYc-prAYc-#}
{#samyaYc-vizvaYc-tiryaYc#}. In the Vedas it occurs also in com-
position with pronominal and nominal themes, f. i. in {#vi-#}
{#zvadryaYc-devadryaYc-GftAYc#}. When it has the meaning of ‘go-
ing’, the nasal of the root appears only in the nom.,
voc. and acc. of the sing. and du. masc., in the nom. and
voc. of the plur. masc. and neuter and in the acc. of
the plur. neuter; in all the other cases and in the formation
of the fem. it is dropped. The declension and the fem. for-
mation of {#aYc#} ‘honouring, worshipping’ is regular in re-
taining the nasal of the root. E. {#aYc,#} kṛt aff. {#kvin#}.
