{#atitvam#}Â¦ Tatpur. m. Surpassing thee. E. {#ati#} (sc. {#krAntaH#})
and {#tvam#} (in the sense of {#tvAm#}). This word seems to be,
like the last, only a grammatical one and scarcely in real
use; its declension is equally purely fictitious and vary-
ing, even, according to the different grammatical autho-
rities. See the following and {#atitvAm, atiyUyam,#} also
{#atyaham#}.
