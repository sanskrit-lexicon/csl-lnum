{#apahAra#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-raH#}) <sup>1</sup> Taking away, carrying off, re-
moving; also figuratively; comp. {#AtmApahAra#}. <sup>2</sup> (In Law.)
<sup>a.</sup> Stealing, robbing; see {#apaharaRa#} and the definition given
of the latter word. <sup>b.</sup> Concealing, secreting; according to
{%Jīmūtavāhana%} in the passage of the {%Dāyabhāga:%} {#na sADAraRa-#}
{#DanApahAre steyanizpattiH#} ‘the notion of theft is not completed
in a case of concealment of property common (to two or
more)’, when the word {#apahAra#} is thus explained: {#apahA-#}
{#rapadaM tu saMgopanABiprAyam . na ca saMgopanaM steyamuktam . asaM-#}
{#guptaharaRe'pi steyapadapradarSanAt#}. <sup>c.</sup> Withholding property
from its lawful owner; in the passage of the {%Dāyabhāga%}
and the {%Dāyakramasaṅgraha:%} {#strIRAM svapatidAyastu upaBo-#}
{#gaPalaH smftaH . nApahAraM striyaH kuryuH patidAyAtkaTaMcana;#} where
{%Jīmūtavāhana%} explains {#apahAra#} in this manner: {#apahAraSca#}
{#DanasvAmyanupayoge Bavati#}. (The quotation from the {%Dāyabhāga%}
by {%Rādhākāntadeva%} s. v. {#apahAra,#} viz. {#‘DanasvAmyanupayogi-#}
{#vyayaH’#}--as well as the translations which have been founded
on it--seem to arise from a mistake, the more so as the
law point in question does not concern the ‘spending’ but
‘the non-delivery to a wife of her lawful property’.) <sup>3</sup> Loss.
<sup>4</sup> (In Astronomy.) The configuration of the minor planets
considered as influencing the fortune of man; comp. {#anta-#}
{#rdaSA#} and {#apahAreSvara#}. E. {#hf#} with {#apa,#} kṛt aff. {#GaY#}.
