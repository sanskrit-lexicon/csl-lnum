{#anuvAkyA#}¦ Tatpur. f. ({#-kyA#}) The name of such verses of the
Ṛgveda as are recited by the priest Hotṛ (q. v.), when the
deity is invoked by him to partake of the Havis or clarified
butter. This word is found frequently together with {#yAjyA#}
(q. v.), the name of those hymns of the same Veda which
are recited by the Hotṛ when the Havis-oblation is actually
made. The Anuvākyās are spoken in a slow or as it were
drawling tone, while the Yājyās are recited quickly. Accord-
ing to the Mīmānsā no priest but the Hotṛ is allowed to
recite either of them. Compare also {#puro'nuvAkyA#} and {#yA-#}
{#jyAnuvAkyA#}. E. {#vac#} with {#anu,#} kṛtya aff. {#Ryat#}.
