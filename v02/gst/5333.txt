{#aptoryAma#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-maH#}) (ved.) <sup>1</sup> The name of a sacrifice,
viz. of the seventh or last part ({%somasansthā%}) of the {%Jyo-%}
{%tiṣṭoma;%} ({%Mādhava%} in enumerating the seven parts of the
{%Jyotiṣṭoma,%} in his {%Jaiminiyanyāyam.,%}--accord. to all the
Mss. of this work within my reach--makes it, the sixth part
of the latter, but he is at variance in this respect with the
older authorities of the {%Kalpasūtras%} and of {%Kumārila'%}s
{%Vārttikas%}); it is not {%nitya%} or obligatory for the performance
of this sacrifice, like the {%Agniṣṭoma%} (q. v.), but {%kāmya%} or
voluntary, and instituted merely for the attainment of a
specific desire. See {#jyotizwoma#}. <sup>2</sup> The name of a Śamaveda-
verse, becauses it closes the ceremonies connected with the
sacrifice of this name. E. {#aptos#} (abl. of {#aptu#}) and {#yAma#}.
The literal meaning of this word would be in conformity
with the definition of the {%Prauḍhamanoramā,%} ‘a sacrifice
which procures the attainment of the desired object’: {#aptuH#}
{#SarIramiti . aBilazitArTaSca . AptavyatvAt . ata evAptoryA-#}
{#maSabdasyABilazitArTaprApaka ityavayavArTamAhuH,#} when {#aptoH#}
would be, not the ablat., but the genitive of {#aptu#} 4. q. v.,
and {#yAma#} have the sense of {#prApaka;#} but it is more probable
that {#yAma#} means ‘termination’ and that {#aptoH#} represents
the abl. of {#aptu#} q. v., i. e. ‘the last part (scil. of the Jyoti-
[Page206-a+ 56]
ṣṭoma, performed) on account of obtaining, scil. the de-
sired object’; according to the comm. of {%Śatap.%} XIII. 7.
1. 9., however, the word would derive its meaning from
‘the Aptoryāma sacrifice and verse {%including%} the sacrifices
and verses called severally Agniṣṭoma, Ukthya, Shoḍaśin
and Atirātra qq. vv.’: {%Śatap.%} {#sarvezAM yajYakratUnAmAptyE;#} {%Ha-%}
{%risvāmin:%} {#sarvezAM yajYakratUnAmiti . sarvARyagnizwomokTyazoqa-#}
{#SyatirAtranAmAni#} [to be read thus probably instead of the
meaningless {#‘°nAmiM#} (?)’ in the present publication of Ex-
tracts from this comm.] {#stotraSastrARi cAptoryAme'ntarBavantI-#}
{#tyaBiprAyaH;#} when {#aptoH#} would mean ‘on account of ob-
taining or comprising’, scil. Agniṣṭoma &c.
