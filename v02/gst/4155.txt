[{#annAkAlaBfta#}.¦ A misreading for {#anAkAlaBfta#} q. v. As the
reading {#annAkAlaBfta#} occurs in the present edition of the
Vivādachintāmaṇi while the reading {#anAkAlaBfta#} is given
in one E. I. H. Ms. of it, in both actual editions of the Mi-
tākṣara and in the E. I. H. Mss. of this work in the same
sense, it may be as well to observe that the meaning in-
tended by the former part of the compound could not be ex-
pressed by the word {#annAkAla#} but, if {#anna#} were to make part
of it, would require a form {#anannakAla; anAkAla,#} however,
similar in structure to {#anAvfzwi,#} is a correct formation im-
plying ‘hard time in general i. e. time of distress, famine &c.’.]
