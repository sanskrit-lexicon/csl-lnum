{#anyonyasampad#}¦ Tatpur. f. ({#-t#}) Mutual power or good qua-
lities, e. g. {#avAdvAyuH SanEryasyAM latAM nartayamAnavat . nAyA-#}
{#sayanta saMtrastA ftavo'nyonyasaMpadaH;#} (this compound seems
however to be a poetical liberty in Bhaṭṭik. 8. 61, instead of
{#anyonyaM sampadaH#} ‘the seasons frightened did not check each
other in their charms’ not: the charms of each other.) E.
