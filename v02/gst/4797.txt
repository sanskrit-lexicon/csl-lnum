{#aparigraha#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-haH#}) <sup>1</sup> Non-encompassing, non-com-
prehension; e. g. in the {%Vedānta Sūtra:%} {#aparigrahAccAtyanta-#}
{#manapekzA#}. <sup>2</sup> Non-acceptance. In the latter sense this word
has assumed a special bearing in the {%Yoga%} philosophy and
in such passages of the {%Upan.%} and other writings (compare
e. g. {%Wilson's Viṣṇup.%} p. 288. n. 2), as refer to the doctrine
of this philosophy; it means there: {%renouncing every thing%}
{%that can afford enjoyment,%} as a commentator observes,
from the perception of the defects that inhere in mundane
objects, as they must be acquired, preserved, as they pe-
rish, produce affection and cause the infliction of injury

{#vizayARAmarjanarakzaRakzayasaNgahiMsAdozadarSanAdasvIkaraRamapari-#}
{#grahaH#}); it is in the Yoga phil. the last of the five categories of
the term {#yama#} q. v., the latter being one of the eight Angas
or constituent parts of the Yoga (see {#yogANga#}). Renun-
ciation however must be understood there in its widest sense,
also as indifference to one's own body, since the soul's as-
suming a body is also {#parigraha#} or covetousness, for body
is the instrument of enjoyment and passion is connected
with it; and only the Yogin who is firm in the renun-
ciation in this widest sense, obtains a knowledge of the
condition of former and subsequent existences: {#aparigra-#}

fifth {#yama,#} contrary to the {%Yoga S.,%} {#akalmaza,#} equally so {%Hari-%}
{%hara;%} but {%Vidyāvinodāchārya%} names it correctly in his comm.
{#aparigraha#}.)--The comm. on the {%Sāṅkhya%} phil., while re-
taining the definition of {#yama#} as given by Patanjali, have
made {#yama#} one of the four categories of {#Darma#} (q. v.), righte-
ousness, {#Darma#} being in the Sāṅkhya one of the four categories
of {#budDi#} (q. v.), intellect, when it is {#sAtvika#} or under the in-
fluence of the quality of goodness. E. {#a#} neg. and {#parigraha#}.
