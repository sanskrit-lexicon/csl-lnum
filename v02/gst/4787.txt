{#aparAhRa#}¦ Tatpur. m. n. ({#-hRaH-hRam#}) The last part of the day;
before sunset, e. g. {#aTa yadUrDvamaparAhlAtprAgastamayAtsa upa-#}
[Page171-b+ 56]
{#dravaH#} &c.; the fourth part of the day or three Muhūrtas
(= six Daṇḍas), if the day is divided into five equal parts,
({%Mitākṣara:%} {#aparAhlaSca paYcaDAviBakte dine caturTo BAgastri-#}
{#muhUrtaH#}).--Besides the last definition {%Rādhākāntadeva%} al-
leges the following from vaidik and law texts: the last por-
tion of the day, if the latter is divided into two halves;
or the third portion of the day, if it is divided into three
parts, i. e. the last ten Daṇḍas, if the division is into thirty
Daṇḍas.--[The neuter gender of the word is given on the
only authority of the {%Gaṇa%} to {%Pāṇ.%} II. 4. 31. and on that of
the {%Gaṇaratnam.,%} where it is also mentioned amongst the
{#arDarcAdi;#} but the {%Sūtra%} of {%Pāṇ.%} II. 4. 29. would be an ex-
plicit authority {%against%} the correctness of the neuter gender
of this word, at least at Pāṇini's period; comp. also the in-
stances to V. 4. 88. and VIII. 4. 7.; and it may be observed,
too, that the restriction, as regards the Dwigu compounds
the latter part of which is {#rAtri,#} as {#dvirAtram, trirAtram#}
(II. 4. 29. v. 1.), belongs to a Vārttika which neither occurs
in the {%Mahābhāṣya%} nor in the {%Kāśikā;%} comp. also the masc.
forms {#dvirAtraH, trirAtraH,#} {%Kāśikā%} to {%Pāṇ.%} V. 4. 87.] E. {#apara#}
(see I. 1. 3.) and {#ahna,#} a substitute of {#ahan#} (or as the Kā-
śikā explains: of {#aha,#} i. e. {#apara#} and {#ahan,#} samāsānta aff.
{#wac#}), with the change of {#n#} to {#Ra#}.
