{#adadryaYc#}Â¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-dryaN-drIcI-dryak#}) Going to that.
(This word is probably one of a mere grammatical coinage,
to illustrate a rule concerning the pronom. theme {#adas#}.
According to some it would have the same meaning as {#a-#}
{#damuyaYc, amudryaYc#} and {#amumuyaYc#} to which others add {#ada-#}
{#mudryaYc, amumUyaYc, adamUyaYc#} qq. vv., but it might also be
that {#adadryaYc#} (as well as {#adamuyaYc, adamudryaYc, adamUyaYc#})
is formed to show that its first part represents not the
whole theme, but merely the neuter of {#adas,#} while the
first part of {#amudryaYc, amumuyaYc#} and {#amumUyaYc#} refer to its
masc. and femin. For the declension of this word, see
{#aYc#} II. E. {#adas#} and {#aYc#} (II. 1.), with {#adri#} instead of
the final {#as#} of {#adas#}.
