{#anfta#}¦ Tatpur. I. 1. m. f. n. ({#-taH-tA-tam#}) Untrue.
<div n="P">2. n. ({#-tam#}) Untruth, falsehood. (In the mythology
of the Purāṇas Anṛta is the son of Adharma (vice) and
Hinsā (violence), and the brother of Nikṛti (immorality);
they intermarry and have two sons, Bhaya (fear) and Na-
raka (hell) and twins to them, two daughters, Māyā (de-
ceit) and Vedanā (torture) who became their wives.--In the
Rāmāyaṇa Anṛta is the name of one of the mystical weapons
delivered to Rāma by Viśvāmitra.) E. {#a#} neg. and {#fta#}.
<div n="P">II. n. ({#-tam#}) Agriculture. E. According to the native comm.
the etym. would be the same as before; their account for the
meaning ‘agriculture’ however is not very plausible, some
explain it: ‘because agriculture is like falsehood’ or ‘because
agriculture cannot be carried on without falsehood’, another
refers {#fta#} in this sense to the radical {#f#} ‘to hurt’ and ex-
plains it as a Bahuvr. ‘that from which injury does not
arise’. The etym. of this meaning and its probable con-
nection with {#pramfta#} used in the same sense by Manu will be
discussed in the Preface.
