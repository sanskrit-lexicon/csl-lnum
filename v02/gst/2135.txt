{#aDvan#}¦ m. ({#-DvA#}) <sup>1</sup> Sky, atmosphere (only in the Vedas).
<sup>2</sup> A road. <sup>3</sup> Time. <sup>4</sup> A place (perhaps, a place where four
roads meet). <sup>5</sup> A branch or school of the Vedas or sacred
literature.--In some Tatpurusha compounds the former
part of which is an {#upasarga#} (q. v.), this word occurs in the
form of {#aDva;#} i. e. the compound assumes the samāsānta
aff. {#ac;#} e. g. {#prADva, niraDva, pratyaDva#}.--(The two last
meanings of this word are rather unsettled through the
variety of readings in the native dictionaries from which
they are taken; some read {#aDvA…saMsTAne syAdavaskanDe,#}
[Page063-b+ 56]
others {#saMsTAne sASravaskanDe;#} the best reading, however, that
which has been adopted in the present translation, seems
to be this: {#saMsTAne SAstravatskanDe#}.) E. doubtful; according
to some, {#ad,#} uṇ. aff. {#kvanip,#} with {#D#} substituted for {#d#}
‘because it eats up the strength of the traveller’; or ac-
cording to others, {#at,#} uṇ. aff. {#kvanip,#} with {#D#} instead of {#t#}.
