{#apaHsaMvarta#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-rtaH#}) (In Buddhistic doctrine.) The destruc-
tion of the earth by water. ‘A hundred thousand years pre-
vious to the destruction of the earth by water, a Deva ap-
pears to warn all the beings concerned of the event, as when
it is destroyed by fire; a cloud forms at the same time in a
Kela-laksha of Sakwalas and after raining for a short time
disappears. After an immense interval another cloud appears,
and the rain called Khārodaka begins to fall; at first in
small drops, but gradually increasing in size until they are
as large as a palm tree; this rain is so acrid that it dissolves
entirely the earth and all things connected with it’ (Spence
Hardy, Manual of Buddhism p. 32). E. {#apas#} and {#saMvarta#}.
