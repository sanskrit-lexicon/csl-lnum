{#apAnnapAt#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-t#}) (ved.) An epithet or name of
Agni (fire) and Savitri (sun).--{%Sāyaṇa%} explains this word
as meaning literally either ‘not protecting ({#na-pAt,#} from
{#pA,#} kṛt aff. {#Satf#}) or not allowing to fall down ({#na-pAt#}
from the caus. of {#pat,#} kṛt aff. {#kvip#}) the waters’, fire or
sun drying up the water; or ‘the grandson of the waters’,
water bringing forth plants and trees, and plants and trees
being the cause of fire; the latter explanation, apparently
more congenial with the vaidik poetry than the former, is
also given by {%Yāska.%} Comp. {#ap#} and {#apAnnaptf#}. [The word has
two accents, viz. the udātta on the second and third syllable
and is given by the Padatext of the Ṛgveda as representing
not a compound, but two distinct words; that it may be
analyzed so, is indubitable from passages where it occurs
e. g. in the form {#napAtamapAm#}. On the other hand it must be ob-
served that the double accent belongs also to other and similar
Tatpur. mentioned in the {%Gaṇa%} to {%Pāṇ.%} VI. 2. 140. (comp. e. g.
{#tanUnapAt#}) and that this Gaṇa would comprise more words
than those mentioned in the present edition of Pāṇ. and the
ordinary Gaṇa lists as well as in the Kāśikā, if we may believe
the {%Svaramañjarī%} of {%Nṛsinha,%} which mentions e. g. {#Sukagra-#}
{#nTinO#} (not referring this word to VI. 2. 141.) and concludes
with {#ityAdi;#} it may be observed too, that the {%Nighanṭu%}
mentions {#apAnnapAt#} as {%one%} of the thirty-two {#pada#} enumerated
V. 4., and that {%Sāyaṇa%} in his comm. cannot have looked
upon it otherwise than as a compound when he writes e. g.
{#apAMnapAtsaMjYako'gniH;#} comp. also the remark of {%Patanjali%}
s. v. {#apAnnaptf#}. The genitive {%plur.%} as a former part of a com-
pound, is of rare occurrence, but met with also in other
[Page187-a+ 56]
compounds beginning with {#apAm,#} e. g. {#apAMvatsa, apAnnATa,#}
{#apAmpati#} &c. and in the Tatpur. {#devAnAMpriya#} ({%Pāṇini%} VI. 3. 21.
{%Vārtt.%} 4.). E. {#apAm#} (gen. plur. of {#ap#}) and {#napAt#}.
