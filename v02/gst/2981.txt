{#anudAtta#}¦ Tatpur. (In Grammar.) 1. m. f. n. ({#-ttaH-ttA-ttam#})
Not elevated, not being pronounced with the accent called
{#udAtta#} (q. v.) or {#svarita#} (q. v.) (as the syllable of a word).
<div n="P">2. m. ({#-ttaH#}) The not elevated accent, the accent (see
{#svara#} and {#vAhyaprayatna#}) which is neither {#udAtta#} (q. v.) nor
{#svarita#} (q. v.) and which by the depression of the voice, it
requires, prepares, as it were, for the greater effort in the
pronunciation of the syllables accented with the {#udAtta#} or
{#svarita#}. This depression being the greatest when the syl-
lable having the {#anudAtta#} accent, is immediately followed
by a syllable accented with the {#udAtta#} or {#svarita,#} the {#anu-#}
{#dAtta#} is called in this case {#anudAttatara#} ‘a very anudātta’.
The mode of marking the {#anudAtta,#} is restricted, as is also
the case with the other two accents, to the vaidik Sanhitās
(Sanhitā-Pāṭhas) and Brāhmaṇas, and varies according to
the different Vedas. In the Sanhitā, Pada and the Brāhmaṇas
of the Ṛgveda, in the Sanhitā and Pada of the Yajur- and
Sanhitā of the Atharvaveda the Anudātta is marked with a
horizontal line under the syllable so accented ({%thus becoming%}
{%comparable also in graphic value to the sign of the Virāma, the%}
{%horizontal line representing as it were the repose in accentua-%}
{%tion%}); in the Brāhmaṇas of the White Yajurveda, it is not
marked at all; and in the Sanhitā of the Sāmaveda the anu-
dātta syllable when anudāttatara before an udātta, or before
a svarita syllable bearing the figures {#2#} or {#3,#} is marked with
the figure {#3#} over it, except when it is preceded in the be-
ginning of a verse by other anudātta syllables, in which
case only the first anudātta syllable bears the figure {#3,#}
while the following anudātta syllables are left unmarked.
If the anudāttatara is followed by a svarita syllable bearing
the sign {#2ra,#} the syllable so accented is marked with {#3ka#}.
In the Pada-text of the Sāmaveda the sign {#3#} denotes the
anudāttatara before an udātta, if the latter occupies the
second syllable from the beginning, or the syllable before
an anudāttatara, if the latter is followed by a svarita, or
lastly the anudātta accentuation of a syllable so marked and
of all the syllables following it until an udātta or svarita
syllable comes; the sign {#3ka#} or {#ka#} denotes the anudāttatara
immediately followed by a svarita. Compare also the terms
{#nIca, nihata, nyasta, nyastatara, niyata, niGAta, nyAsa, niyama#}
and the radd. {#han#} with {#ni#} and {#yam#} with {#ni#}.--In the native
[Page090-b+ 56]
lists of radicals, the Dhātupāthas, certain radicals have the
anudātta accent as an {#it#} (q. v.) or {#anubanDa#} (q. v.) connected
with them i. e. as a technical sign for certain rules they are
subject to with respect to derivation &c. See also {#anu-#}
{#dAttet#} and {#anudAttopadeSa#}. E. {#a#} neg. and {#anudAtta#}.
