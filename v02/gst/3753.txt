[Page119-a+ 56]
{#antarAyAm#} when referring to {#puri;#} see meaning I. 1. 1.)
<div n="P">1. <sup>1</sup> Interior, being in the middle of or between, the
reverse of {#vAhya;#} e. g. {#AtmA sarvAntaraH;#} or {#aDyAvasAyABimA-#}
{#nasaMkalpAlocanAni cAntarARi vAhyASca sarve vyApArA Atmani#}
{#pratizidDAni bodDavyAni#}.--The words {#antaraH SAwakaH,#} plur.
({#antare#} or {#antarAH SAwakAH#}) mean ‘lower garments’, ac-
cording to some, ‘of three or four garments that which is
nearest the body’ (lit. between the body and the exterior
garment); {#antare#} or {#antarA gfhA#} (comp. {#antaragfha#}) may
mean either ‘the houses in the interior of a town’, or
‘those situated outside of the town and inhabited by
Chāṇḍālas and other low-caste people’. (The apparent
contradiction between these two meanings arises from the
interpretation of {#vahiryoga#} in Pāṇ. I. 1. 36. which according
to the comm. on the Mahābhāṣya may mean ‘connexion with
an unenclosed place ({#vahis#}), and become applicable to
what is outside’ or may mean ‘connexion with the exterior
and then apply to what is interior’. Comp. however I. 2. 4.)
{#antarA pur#} means ‘a place outside of a town or outside of
a palace’ ({#pur#} implying according to the comm. on the
Mahābhāṣya either the interior of a palace or what is
outside of it; comp. {#antaHpura#}); e. g. {#antarAyAM#} (not {#antara-#}
{#syAM#}) {#puri vasati;#} but see meaning I. 2. 4. <sup>2</sup> Different from,
with a noun in the abl., e. g. {#yo'psu tizWannadByo'ntaro…#}
{#eza ta AtmAntaryAmyamftaH#}. <sup>3</sup> Devoid of(?).
<div n="P">2. <sup>1</sup> Near, proximate (esp. ved.). <sup>2</sup> Similar; comp. also
{#antaratama#}. <sup>3</sup> Related, dear; e. g. {#ayamatyantaro mama#}. Comp.
also {#antaratara#}. <sup>4</sup> Exterior. (See the instances under I. 1. 1.
and compare with {#antare#} or {#°rA gfhA#} the word {#antevAsin#}
‘a Chāṇḍāla’.)
<div n="P">II. n. ({#-ram#}) 1. <sup>1</sup> The interior lit. and fig. <sup>2</sup> Interval,
middle, the space between; e. g. {#aNguleSca kanizWAyA maRi-#}
{#banDasya cAntare#}. Comp. also {#svarAntara, avagrahAntara#}. <sup>3</sup> A
distance, space; comp. also {#prAntara#}. <sup>4</sup> A period, e. g. {#mA-#}
{#sAntaradeyam;#} comp. also {#manvantara#}. <sup>5</sup> Occasion, e. g. {#atrA-#}
{#ntare#}. <sup>6</sup> Difference, e. g. {#praDAnapuruzAntaram#}. <sup>7</sup> (In Algebra.)
The difference between two figures, as resulting from sub-
traction, e. g. {#kAryaH kramAdutkramato'TavANkayogo yaTAsTAna-#}
{#kamantaraM vA;#} or {#vajrAByAsayorantaram#}. <sup>8</sup> An other manner,
another way, another kind; in this meaning {#antara#} is
always the latter part of a compound and will in most
instances answer our word ‘other’ when preceding the
noun, the gender of {#antara#} remaining, of course, the same
i. e. neuter, whatever be the gender of the noun preceding
it as first part of the compound, e. g. {#arTAntaram, hetvanta-#}
{#ram, budDyantaram, pratijYAntaram#} qq. vv. <sup>9</sup> A species, a va-
riety, a kind; e. g. {#matsyo mInAntare,#} ‘{#matsya#} means a species
of fish (viz. the Śapharī)’. <sup>10</sup> A hole, a breach. <sup>11</sup> A weak-
ness, a deficiency, a failing; e. g. {#antarataH kaliH…#}
{#antarataH nalasya viviSavAn#} (comm. {#antarataH . CidrataH#}).
<sup>12</sup> The interior in a philosophical sense, the supreme Soul,
the soul, e. g. {#dfzwvAntaraM jyotirupArarAma;#} the mind, e. g.
{#sAntaraduHKa#} (comm. {#antaHkaraRaduHKasahita#}). Comp. {#antara-#}
{#pUruza#}. <sup>13</sup> A surety, a bondsman (‘one who stands between
the creditor and debtor’). <sup>14</sup> Disappearance(?). See the
following.
[Page119-b+ 56]
<div n="P">2. <sup>1</sup> End. <sup>2</sup> Destruction, annihilation. (Both meanings
occur in a Ms. of Ajayapāla viz. {#‘anta’#} and {#‘vinASa’#} besides
{#‘antarDi’;#} the copy I use, however, is too indifferent
in this place to be relied upon; the meaning {#vyasana#} which
is amongst the meanings given in one of the Mss. of the
Nānārthamañjarī--E. I. H. 2544--may imply the same
notion but may also coincide with II. 1. 11. ‘a weakness &c.’;
‘{#ranDre maDye vinAvasre#} (sic; instead of {#vinA'vasare#} which
would give one syllable too much) {#vyavaDAne'ntarAtmani .#}
{#bahiryoge'vakASe ca viSeze vyasane'ntaram#}’; but there oc-
curs a safer trace of the latter meaning in a comm. of
the Nalodaya (3. 6.) where the various reading {#antaratadvfdDizu#}
is amongst others explained {#‘antaraM vinASaM tanotIti anta-#}
{#ratat . tAdfSA vfdDayaH . nalasya fdDayo DanAgamAstezu’#}).
<div n="P">III. See {#antaram#} and {#antareRa#}. E. The native etym. {#anta#}
and {#ra#} (from {#rA,#} kṛt aff. {#ka#}) has no probability. It seems
that the meanings arranged under I. 1. and II. 1. are con-
nected in origin with those of {#antar#} and the meanings under
I. 2. and II. 2. with the meanings of {#anta,#} the former in the
lineage of the notions of <sup>a.</sup> within; <sup>b.</sup> 1. in the middle,
between, 2. interval, 3. difference, 4. breach; <sup>c.</sup> under(?);
the latter in the lineage of <sup>a.</sup> end, <sup>b.</sup> proximity, <sup>c.</sup> exterior.
But in the same manner as the meanings of {#anta#} and {#antar#}
coincide in many respects (comp. also {#antarA#}) as probably
arising from the same origin, it would appear possible to
derive {#antara#} (comp. {#antama#}), as well as {#anta#} and {#antar#}
from a common source instead of assuming that {#antara#} re-
presents two etym., one from {#anta#} and another from {#antar#}
See the Preface. [In a Gaṇalist to Pāṇini, {#antara#} occurs
among the words which as latter parts form Tatpur. com-
pounds with other words depending on them in the sense
of a locative; but it seems that the reading {#antar,#} which
is given in the Ganaratnam. and exemplified in its comm.--
while only mention is made there of the reading {#antara#}--,
is preferable; see s. v. {#antar#} V. 2.]
