{#aBijYa#}¦ Tatpur. 1. m. f. n. ({#-jYaH-jYA-jYam#}) Knowing, under-
standing, conversant with, skilled in; e. g. {%Sāṅkhyat. Kaum.:%}
{#izwApUrtena dAkziRaH puruzatatvAnaBijYo hIzwApUrtakArI kAmopa-#}
{#hatamanA vaDyate;#} or {%Bhaṭṭik.:%} {#indrajidvikramABijYo manvAno#}
{#vAnaraM jitam…agAt#} &c.; when not compounded with
a preceding noun, the object of knowledge stands in the
genit. or locat.; thus the comm. of the {%Bhaṭṭik.%} explain
{#viyogaduHKAnuBAvAnaBijYEH, viyogaduHKasya yo'nuBavaH .#}
{#anuBavanam . tasyAnaBijYEH#} or {#tatrAnaBijYEH#}. E. {#jYA#} with {#aBi,#}
kṛt aff. {#ka#}.
<div n="P">2. f. ({#-jYA#}) <sup>1</sup> Remembrance, recollection ({%Kāśikā:%} =
{#smftiH#}); e. g. {%Bhaṭṭik.:%} {#nABijYA te mahArAja jezyAvaH Sakra-#}
{#pAlitam…nABijYA te sayakzendraM BakzyAvo yadyamaM balAt;#}
or {%Lalitav.:%} {#DyAnapAramitADarmAlokamuKaM sarvajYAnABijYotpA-#}
{#dAya vikziptacittasattvaparipAcanatAyE saMvartate#}. <sup>2</sup> (In Buddhistic
doctrine.) Supernatural knowledge, a supernatural faculty
attached to the Arhatship; there are five, or according to
some six, such faculties viz. 1. the faculty of divine sight,
i. e. the faculty of seeing, without obstacle, all beings and
bodies, of whatever kind, in the totality of the worlds;
2. that of divine hearing, i. e. the faculty of understanding
all words of joy or grief uttered by the beings, and all
sounds of whatever kind uttered in all the worlds (or ‘the
power to hear all sounds whether distant or near, whether
made by devas or men’: {%Spence Hardy'%}s {%Eastern Monachism%});
3. that of knowing the thoughts of other beings; 4. that
of knowing former existences or what births have been
got in former ages; 5. magic power or the power to
assume any shape, to pass without obstacle over seas and
mountains, and to disappear from one world for the sake
of reappearing in another; to these some add: 6. {%āśra-%}
{%vakshaya,%} (which according to {%Burnouf%} probably means)
the power of destroying defects or vices. (See {%Burnouf'%}s
{%Lotus de la bonne loi%} p. 820 seqq.; there is a difference be-
tween this enumeration and that of {%Hardy%} in his {%Eastern%}
{%Monachism%} (p. 284): he has but five {%abhijnās,%} identifies the
magic power and the {%āśravakṣaya%} without defining how-
ever either term, omits the first (the faculty of divine
sight) and has an {%abhijnā%} not named by {%Burnouf:%} the
power of knowing what births will be received in fu-
ture ages). Compare {#zaqaBijYa#}. E. {#jYA#} with {#aBi,#} kṛt
aff. {#aN;#} (but meaning 2. is probably better analyzed
{#aBi#} and {#jYA#}).
