{#anuveDa#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-DaH#}). The same as {#anuvyADa#} q. v. E. In
following the native lexicographical etym. of {#veDa,#} this word
would come from {#viD#} with {#anu,#} kṛt aff. {#GaY,#} the radical
{#viD#} assuming in this derivative the meaning of {#vyaD;#} it will
appear however that the form {#veDa#} in the meaning of {#vyaDa,#}
and {#anuveDa#} in that of {#anuvyADa#} are objectionable, from a
gramm. point of view, since {#viD#} does not occur otherwise
in the meaning “to pierce” and {#veDa#} is not mentioned by
the best gramm. authorities as a derivative of either {#viD#}
or {#vyaD#}.
