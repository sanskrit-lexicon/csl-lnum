{#apacI#}¦ Tatpur. f. ({#-cI#}) (In Medicine.) A disease consisting
in ‘a number of tumors some of which are of the size of
an Amalaka-stone and others like spawn, which cause
itching, but otherwise little pain, burst, suppurate and dis-
appear when others come again’. E. accord. to Suśruta
{#apa#} and {#cI,#} i. e. ‘a bad gathering’; for he writes {#‘(granTi-#}
{#BiH) ananyavarRErupacIyamAnaM cayaprakarzAdapacIM vadanti’;#} an
etym. ‘{#a#} and {#paca#}’ would not merely be at variance with
its femin. form. in {#I,#} but with the nature of the disease
itself, since the tumors so called attain maturity; for they
burst and suppurate: {#‘kaRqUyutAste'lparujaH praBinnAH sravanti#}
{#naSyanti Bavanti cAnye’#}.
