{#anagnizvAtta#}¦ Tatpur. m. pl. ({#-ttAH#}) The name of a particular
class of Pitṛs or Manes. This word is explained by a
commentator of the Yajurveda: ‘not tasted by ({#svAtta#}) i. e.
not burnt by fire, not having received the obsequies in con-
formity with the religious rites’ and it appears therefore as
a synonyme of {#anagnidagDa,#} as well as the converse of {#agni-#}
{#zvAtta#} which, according to the same commentator, would
be a synonyme of {#agnidagDa#}. Anagniṣvātta does not occur
in the list of the Pitṛs which are given in the law books
and in the Purāṇas, while {#agnidagDa#} and {#agnizvAtta#} (qq. vv.)
are named there as distinct classes and explained in a
different manner. The etymology given, which identifies
{#svAtta#} and {#svAdita,#} seems moreover objectionable. E. {#a#}
and {#agnizvAtta#}.
