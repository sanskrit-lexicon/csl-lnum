{#anvADeya#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-yam#}) (In Law.) An item of a married
woman's property; see {#strIDana#}. It is defined by {%Kātyāyana%}
as property ‘which is received by a woman, after marriage,
from the family of her husband or from her own relatives’
(i. e. from her maternal uncle &c., according to Viṣṇu,
or from the relatives of her parents, as the author of
the Dāyabhāga interprets the latter word). [{#kAtyAyanaH .#}

{#prAyam’#} or {#‘BartfkulAt . SvaSurakulAdeH . banDukulAt . pitfmA-#}
{#tfkulAt#}.--The reading in the printed edd. of the second
portion of the Mitākṣara {#‘labDaM pitfkulAttaTA’#} would there-
fore require {#pitf#} to be taken in the sense of {#‘pitaraH#} parents’
not in that of ‘father’; but the given reading seems pre-
ferable as it occurs in several Mss. (E. I. H.) of this work,
in Kullūka on Manu 9. 195 (with the v. 1. {#banDukule taTA#}), in two
passages of the Dāyabhāga (pp. 116 and 149) with the com-
ment quoted, and in the Dāyakramas. p. 17, where the comm.
is: {#banDukulAdityatra banDupadena mAtApitrorupalakzaRam#}. In the
Vivādachintāmaṇi p. 139 the latter half of the verse reads
thus: {#anvADeyaM tu tatproktaM yallabDaM svakulAttaTA#}.] {%Bhṛgu%} defines
this property as ‘whatever is received with pleasure by a
woman, after the marriage ceremony, from her husband and
her parents’ [{#UrDvaM labDaM tu yatkiMcitsaMskArAtprItitaH striyA .#}
{#BartuH pitroH sakASAdvA#} (or {#BartuH sakASAtpitrorvA#}) {#anvADeyaM#}
{#tu tadBfguH#}]; when the Dāyabhāga and Dāyakramas. in quoting
this passage supply after ‘her husband’: ‘and from those re-
lated to her through her husband, i. e. father-in-law &c.’ and
after ‘her parents’: ‘and from those related to her through
her parents, i. e. grandparents &c.’, so as to effectuate a con-
cordance between Kātyāyana and Bhṛgu. [Dāyabh. {#mAtA-#}
