<sup>2</sup> (In vaidik grammar; scil. {#anvakzarasanDi#}) One of the two
kinds of the Sandhi called {#anvakzarasanDi#} q. v., viz. when a
final vowel or the last syllable of {#ezaH, syaH#} or {#saH#} is fol-
lowed by a consonant (of a new word; the case in the latter
three instances being similar to those of the meeting between
a final vowel and a beginning consonant, since their Visarga
is dropped). Compare {#pratiloma#}.

the four successive dhyānas.]
