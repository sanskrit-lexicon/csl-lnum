{#apASraya#}¦ I. Tatpur. m. ({#-yaH#}) <sup>1</sup> A support, a recipient, the
person on which another reposes, as it were, by whom he
is protected; e. g. {#brAhmaRApASrayo nityamutkfzwAM jAtimaSnute#}
(scil. {#SUdraH#}) ‘a Śūdra who is supported by a Brahmaṇa
obtains always a superior birth’; (speculation has been rife
on this passage of {%Manu%} 9. 335.: both Calc. editions read
{#brAhmaRAyASrayo#}--which is meaningless--, another reading
is {#brAhmaRopASrayo,#} and the correctness of the word {#apASraya#}
in this verse has been even doubted; but it occurs and is
commented upon in the same sense ‘recipient, support’ e. g.
in the {%Bhāgavata Pur.%} VI. 19. 12. where Viṣṇu is contrasted
with Śrī:) {#tvaM hi sarvaSarIryAtmA SrIH SarIrendriyASayAH . nA-#}
{#marUpe BagavatI pratyayastvamapASrayaH#} (comm. {#pratyayo nAmarUpayoH#}
{#prakASaH . apASrayaH . tayorADAraH#}); i. e. ‘…thou
makest them manifest and thou art their recipient or sup-
port’.--Comp. also {#apASrita#}. <sup>2</sup> That which rests upon; (used
in this sense {%Daśakumārach.%} ed. {%Wilson%} p. 90, 1. 13, where the
word implies the meaning ‘head’ as resting on the hand).
<sup>3</sup> An awning spread over a court or yard. E. {#Sri#} with {#A#}
and {#apa,#} kṛt aff. {#ac#}.
<div n="P">II. Bahuvr. m. f. n. ({#-yaH-yA-yam#}) Unsupported, helpless.
E. {#apa#} and {#ASraya#}.
