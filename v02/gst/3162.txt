{#anubanDya#}¦ I. Tatpur. m. f. ({#-nDyaH-nDyA#}) One of the three prin-
cipal paśus or sacrificial animals in the Jyotiṣṭoma sacrifice.
(See also {#agnIzomIyapaSu#} and {#savanIyapaSu#}.) It is a cow, and
the proceedings with it take place after the Avabhṛtha on
the fifth day of the Agniṣṭoma (q. v.). But as the sacrifice
of a cow is forbidden in the present or Kali-yuga, a sub-
stitute for it is an offering of curds of two-milk-whey.--
