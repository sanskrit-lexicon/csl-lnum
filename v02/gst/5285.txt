{#apekzAbudDi#}¦ Tatpur. f. ({#-dDiH#}) (In the Vaiśeṣika philosophy.)
Thinking founded on the category of relation; this term
designates more especially:
<div n="P">{%A.%} When applied to the notion of {%quantity%} in general,
[Page202-a+ 56]
that {%mental process in which originates the notion of multipli-%}
{%city;%} it is conceived and defined in the following manner:
‘the eye having come into contact with two substances,
there arises a notion of what is general to the two notions
of ‘unity’ inherent in either substance, viz. the class of
the notions of unity or the {%class of monads;%} these two sub-
stances or unities having become determined, there arises
a thinking of the quality ‘unity’ previously determined by
the general notion (monad) [for the special unity could not
be conceived without a previous knowledge of the general
notion to which it belongs; comp. also the instance in the
comm. to the {%Bhāṣāparichchheda%} v. 57]; this thinking is
the {#apekzAbudDi;#} through it is produced a duality consisting
of these two substances (unities); it leads to the generality
or {%class of dyads;%} this class of dyads is reflected upon,
and through such reflection the {#apekzAbudDi#} ceases; again
that special thinking whose object is the quality ‘duality’,
determined by the general notion (dyad), having produced
the duality of the two substances (unities), the quality
‘duality’ ceases after the {#apekzAbudDi#} (i. e. that thinking
itself) has ceased. [{%Śaṅkara%} in the {%Upaskāra%} on {%Kaṇāda%}
(E. I. H. 232, an indifferent Ms.) {#samAnajatIyayorvA#} (probably

other terms: {%the notion of multiplicity ceases as soon as the%}
{%notion of generality or the class-notion has arisen%} and vice
versa ({%Kaṇāda:%} {#sAmAnyajYAnAdapekzAbudDinASaH#}). From the
moment when the eye comes into contact with the objects
till the moment when the {#apekzAbudDi#} ceases there are eight
phases, viz. 1. contact &c., 2. comprehension of the class
of monads, based on the quality ‘unity’, 3. {#apekzAbudDi#} or
mental reproduction founded on the various qualities ‘unity’
determined by the class of monads, 4. origin of the quality
‘duality’, 5. comprehension of the class of dyads, 6. com-
prehension of the quality ‘duality’ determined by its class,
7. comprehension of the substance determined by the com-
prehension of the class of dyads, 8. mental reproduction.

{#RAH#}.] Again the cessation of the comprehension of multi-
plicity and of the comprehension of generality takes place
in the following order: ‘the comprehension of the class of
monads ceases when the comprehension of multiplicity com-
[Page202-b+ 56]
mences, the latter ceases when the comprehension of the
class of dyads arises, this comprehension ceases when the
comprehension of the quality ‘duality’ commences, and
the latter ceases when the comprehension of the substance
determined by the quality ‘duality’ commences’. [{%Śan-%}

{#viSizwadravyajYAnAt;#} (the terms {#budDi#} and {#jYAna#} have both
here been rendered ‘comprehension’, to indicate that no
distinction is intended by the author in choosing two dif-
ferent words; comp. {%Praśastapāda:%} {#budDirupalabDirjYAnaM pratyaya#}
{#iti paryAyAH#}).]--According to the foregoing definition
the mental process {#apekzAbudDi#} and, consequently, the notion
of multiplicity itself commences with the notion of ‘two’;
others however hold that it begins with the notion of ‘three’.
<div n="P">{%B.%} When applied to the notion of {%space%} and {%time,%} it
designates {%that mental process in which originate the notions%}
{%of ‘far and near’, ‘old and young’%} (see {#paratva#} and {#apa-#}
{#ratva#}); this process, too, which is founded on the dividing
of the same unity (space or time) into two quantities, ceases
as soon as the notion of generality is comprehended; and
the relative notions ‘far and near’, ‘old and young’
cease themselves when the notions ‘space’ and ‘time’ are
conceived; in a similar manner as the {#apekzAbudDi#} ceases
when applied to quantity as soon as the {#sAmAnyajYAna#} com-
mences, and as the quality ‘two &c.’ disappears when the
substance to which it applies, is conceived. [{%Śaṅkara:%} {#ape-#}
