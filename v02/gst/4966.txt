{#apas#}¦ I. 1. n. ({#-paH#}) <sup>1</sup> Action, act, esp. a religious or sacri-
ficial act. (ved.) <sup>2</sup> Water. [It is very doubtful whether
the word is correct in the latter sense, as a {%neuter sing.;%}
comp. I. 2., it occurs as such in the following Sūtra of
{%Kaṇāda%} (E. I. H. Ms. 232) where the reading {#apas#} however
may be a mistake for {#Apas,#} viz. {#pfTivyapastejo vAyurA-#}
{#kASaM kAlo digAtmA mana iti dravyARi ..#}.] Compare also
{#Apas#}. E. {#Ap,#} uṇ. aff. {#asun,#} the vowel of the radical
being shortened; but more probably of {#ap,#} comp. the E.
of {#apta#} and see the Preface.
<div n="P">2. f. plur. ({#-saH#}) (ved.) Water (comp. {#ap#}); e. g. {#bahvI-#}
{#nAM garBo'pasAm#} ‘(Agni) is the child of abundant waters’;
(according to {%Sāyaṇa,%} because he comes as lightning from the
waters collected in the clouds; comp. {#apAM garBaH#} s. v. {#ap#}).
E. {#Ap,#} uṇ. {#asi;#} and as before but see the Preface.
<div n="P">II. 1. m. f. plur. ({#-saH-saH#}) (ved.) <sup>1</sup> Active, engaged in pursuits
in general, more esp. in the performance of religious or
sacrificial acts; in the femin. also as an epithet of the fingers.
<sup>2</sup> Fulfilling an act or business; as an epithet of {#triDAtavaH#}
or ‘the three worlds upheld by the three divinities Fire,
Wind and Sun’, ‘cold, heat, wind, rain &c.’ being, as
{%Mahīdhara%} explains, ‘the doings of the world’. <sup>3</sup> Possessing
activity (or perhaps, referring to religious acts) as an epi-
thet of {#triDAtavaH,#} when, according to {%Mahīdhara,%} in the
sense of {#paSu#} or sacrificial animal. <sup>4</sup> Rapid, swift; as a
river; comp. {#apastama#}.
<div n="P">2. m. ({#-pAH#}) The name of one of the seven Prajāpatis
in the second or the Manwantara of Svārochiṣa, according
to the Mātsya Purāṇa. E. {#apas,#} with luk of the taddh.

<div n="P">III. ind. A further developement of the prefix {#apa#} in com-
bination with the inflected forms, and in composition with
some derivatives, of {#kF#} q. v.; comp. {#apaskara#}. The native
theory considers however {#apaskirate#} &c. as {#apa#} and {#kirate#}
&c. with āgama {#suw;#} see the Preface.
