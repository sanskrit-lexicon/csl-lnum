{#apahartf#}¦ Tatpur. 1. m. f. n. ({#-rtA-rtrI-rtf#}) <sup>1</sup> One who takes
away, carries off, removes. <sup>2</sup> One who steals. <sup>3</sup> One who
conceals or secretes; e. g. {#nikzepasyApahartAram#} (comm. = {#ni-#}
{#kzepasyApahnotAram#}).
<div n="P">2. m. ({#-rtA#}) The name of a brother of the serpent Śeṣa
(according to the {%Harivanśa%} in the translation of {%Langlois%}
vol. II. p. 481). E. {#hf#} with {#apa,#} kṛt aff. {#tfc#} or {#tfn#}. [N. B.
When derived with the kṛt {#tfc,#} the word merely expresses
the notion of the {%agens in general,%} as is the case with all
other derivatives of radicals by means of {#tfc;#} a noun de-
pending on it then stands in the genitive, e. g. {#nikzepasyApa-#}
{#hartA#} ‘a man who secretes a deposit’. But when derived
by means of the affix {#tfn#} it implies moreover {%habit%} and, a
noun depending on it in this sense stands in the accus., e. g.
{#annamapahartAra AhvarakA Bavanti SrAdDe sidDe sati#} ‘the in-
habitants of Ahwara are in the {%habit of carrying off%} the food
after the funeral oblation is performed’; it might seem doubt-
ful, therefore, whether e. g. the passage of the {%Dāyabhāga%}
p. 351, line 18: {#asuvarRaM suvarRabudDyApaharturna suvarRApahAraH#} is
correct and ought not to be {#asuvarRasya#} &c., the word {#apahartf#}
expressing there simply the agens without an additional
notion, as results from the comparison of these words with
p. 350. 1. 16. The word when derived by kṛt {#tfc#} is udātta
on the last syllable; but when derived by {#tfn#} udātta on the
first syllable.]
