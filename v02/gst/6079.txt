{#aBinirmukta#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-ktaH-ktA-ktam#}) <sup>1</sup> Left, quitted.
<sup>2</sup> One asleep at sunset. [The last meaning, given by the
{%Amarak.%} and {%Hemach.,%} owes its origin probably to {%Manu%}
2. 221. or a similar passage, where the word is to be joined
with the word {#sUryeRa,#} both words meaning literally ‘one
left by the sun’, scil. while asleep (this ellipsis resulting
from the preceding verse 2. 220.); the same remark applies
to the meaning {%‘one asleep at sunrise’,%} given by the Koshas
to {#aByudita,#} for in {%Manu%} 2. 221. the latter word is also to
be coupled with {#sUryeRa,#} when both these words mean liter-
ally: ‘one {%towards%} whom the sun has risen’ (scil. while
asleep), the meaning {%towards%} of {#aBi#} in {#aByudita#} resulting
from the beginning of verse 220., where {#aBi#} is {%karmaprav.%}
or the separable preposition, not the verbal prefix; {%Manu%}
2. 220. 221.: {#taM cedaByudiyAtsUryaH SayAnaM kAmacArataH#} ({%v. l.%} {#kA-#}

{#sUryAByudito brahmacArI tizWedaharaBuYjAno'ByastamitaSca rAtriM#}
{#japansAvitrIm#}. The comm. on the {%Amarak.,%} however, ap-
pear to have lost sight of this origin of the meanings ‘asleep
at sunset’ and ‘at sunrise’ of the named words, for {%Rā-%}
{%yamuk.%} e. g. gives the etymological meaning of {#aBi-#}
{#nirmukta#} ‘completely free from feeling, evening work or de-
sign, i. e. completely insensible or disengaged’: {#aBi sarva-#}
{#to BAvena sAyantanena karmaRA niScayena muktaH;#} and he explains
{#aByudita#} as a deriv. of {#aByudita#} with taddh. aff. {#ac,#} re-
ferring it to the {%Gaṇa%} to {%Pāṇ.%} V. 2. 127., when its literal
meaning would be ‘having a sunrise’: {#aByuditamaByudayaH sU-#}
