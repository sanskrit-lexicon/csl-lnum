{#anityasama#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. ({#-maH-mA#}) (In the Nyāya philosophy.)
Wrongly generalizing the predicament of perishableness i. e.
a sophism on perishableness; viz. arguing perishableness
from the reason that every thing is perishable because it
shares in some qualities with other things which are pe-
rishable. E. {#anitya#} and {#sama#} (in the sense of {#jAti,#} sophism);
the masc. form of this word is explained according to some,
by the ellipsis of {#pratizeDa#} or contradiction, as a Sūtra in
the Nyāya treating on a sophism is always followed by
another containing the refutation; or, according to others,
by the ellipsis of {#vikalpa#} (in the sense of {#viviDaH kalpaH#}
i. e. {#prakAraH#} or variousness), there being various sophisms,
viz. twenty-four; or according to others, by the ellipsis of
{#prayoga#} i. e. a (logical) proceeding which likens or produces
the plausibility of perishableness; or the word is taken as
a Bahuvr. with the ellipsis of {#prayoga#} i. e. a logical proceeding
in which perishableness is likened (viz. made plausible).--
As a feminine, {#°samA#} is taken in the sense of {#jAti,#} sophism.
