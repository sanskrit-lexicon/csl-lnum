the word is explained so by a commentator of Manu, where
it appears as an elliptical expression instead of {#anudantajAta,#}
the word {#dantajAta#} preceding immediately; this meaning is
therefore restricted to the passage alone alluded to (book 5
verse 58) and not generally applicable). <sup>2</sup> Born like or with
similar qualities as (another). E. {#anu#} and {#jAta#}.
