{#aDIna#}¦ Bahuvr. m. f. n. ({#-naH-nA-nam#}) <sup>1</sup> Dependant. <sup>2</sup> Docile. E.
{#aDi#} and {#ina#} ‘having a master over one's self’. This word
and the etymology as mentioned, are given by the native
lexicographers; but according to the best grammatical autho-
rities {#aDIna#} would not exist as a real word. Words as {#rA-#}
{#jADIna, brAhmaRADIna#} and the like, are explained by them as
coming from {#rAjADi#} ({#rAjan#} and {#aDi#}), {#brAhmaRADi#} ({#brAhmaRa#}
and {#aDi#}) with taddh. aff. {#Ka,#} or by others as derived from {#rA-#}
{#jan, brAhmaRa#} with taddh. aff. {#saDInan;#} it would seem therefore
that the use of {#aDIna#} as an independant word is grammatically
not correct. But see {#aDyaDIna#} and {#anaDInaka#}.
