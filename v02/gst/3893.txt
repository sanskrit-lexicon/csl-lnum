{#antaryAmin#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-mI#}) <sup>1</sup> (In the Upan. and the oldest
Vedānta phil.) The supreme Soul as the inward regulator
of all the phenomena of the material and intellectual world,
in this and in a future life: {#‘ya imaM ca lokaM paraM ca lokaM#}

{#vedamaDiyajYamaDiBUtamaDyAtmaM ca kaScidantaravasTito yamayitA-#}
{#ntaryAmI’;#} not merely ‘the individual Soul of a divinity, of
a living being &c.’, but the same as the {#paramAtman; ‘antaryAmya-#}
{#DidEvAdizu tadDarmavyapadeSAt’…‘tasmAtparamAtmEvAntaryAmI’#}.--
<sup>2</sup> (In the later Vedānta.) Brahman (m.) as creator of the
world when under the influence of the first Gunā or of the
cosmical quality of {#sattva#} ‘goodness’; as such however, he

is freed of all cosmical qualities. <sup>3</sup> (In the Vedānta applied to
the doctrine of the sects.) <sup>a.</sup> Viṣṇu or Purushottama when be-
coming human or individual Soul; e. g. {#antaH praviSya BUtAni#}
