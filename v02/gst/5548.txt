{#aprayAvam#}¦ Tatpur. ind. (ved.) Assiduously, attentively; ({%Mahīdh.%}
= {#apramattam#}). E. According to this comm. the word would
be the acc. neuter of a Bahuvr. {#a#} priv. and {#prayAva,#} but as
it is udātta on the first syllable it seems more correct to
derive it from {#a#} neg. and {#prayAvam#} ({#yu#} with {#pra,#} kṛt aff.
{#Ramul#}).
