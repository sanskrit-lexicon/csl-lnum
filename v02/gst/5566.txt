{#apravfdDa#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-dDaH-dDA-dDam#}) Not full grown, not
very large &c.; see the meanings of {#pravfdDa#}. [N. B. This
word is mentioned in the modern compilation of a comm.
to {%Pāṇini%} as an instance to the ākritigaṇa {#pravfdDAdi#} (VI. 2.
147.), when it would be udātta on the last syllable; but it
occurs neither in the {%Kāśikā,%} nor in the {%Siddhaṇtak.%} and
its comm., the {%Praudhamanor.,%} nor in {%Nṛsinha'%}s {%Swara-%}
{%mañjarī;%} and as {%Patanjali%} and his commentators {%Kaiyyata%}
and {%Nagojibhaṭṭa%} have no gloss on this Sūtra, it becomes
very doubtful whether the quoted Gaṇa extends to the word
{#pravfdDa#} in composition with the neg. {#a#}.] E. {#a#} neg. and {#pravfdDa#}.
