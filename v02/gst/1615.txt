{#adas#}Â¦ I. m. f. n. ({#asO-asO-adas#}). The pronoun (see {#sarva-#}
{#nAman#}) which generally points to what is absent, remote
or uncertain (differently from {#idam#} q. v.) and which cor-
responds with <sup>1</sup> That. <sup>2</sup> A certain (so and so). In correlative
phrases it stands therefore usually in the prior sentence,
imparting greater emphasis. Its declension is defective in
as far as most of its cases are supplied by the themes {#asu#}
or {#asa, amu (amU)#} and {#ami (amI)#}. The theme which ap-
[Page047-b+ 56]
pears in composition is {#adas#} (except in the forms {#ada-#}
{#dryaYc#} &c. q. v. See also {#adDA#}). In some derivations of rare
occurrence we meet also with the themes {#asu, asa#} and {#amu;#}
see {#asuka, asaka, amuka#}.
<div n="P">II. ind. (esp. in composition with radicals (see {#gati#}),
when employed reflectively). So, in such a manner, f. i.
{#adaHkftya#} having done so &c.--In conjunction with a re-
lative pronoun or particle it has the effect of giving em-
phasis or of generalising, e. g. {#yadadas#} whatever, {#yatrAdas#}
wherever, {#yaTAdas#} howsoever. E. unknown; but it is pro-
bably derived from the theme {#ad#} which occurs in {#ada-#}
{#dryaYc#} and {#adDA#}.
