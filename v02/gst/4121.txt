{#annaprASana#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-nam#}) Giving food to eat, scil. to a
[Page135-a+ 56]
child: the seventh of the ten essential rites enjoined to the
the three first castes (see {#saMskAra#}); it ought to take place
according to Āsvālāyana, Manu, Yājnavalkya &c. in the
sixth month after a child's birth; according to Kātyāyana
and his school in the sixth (or, according to some, in the
eighth month) if the child is a boy, in the fifth or seventh,
if it is a girl. According to Āsvālāyana a father, if he
desire plenty (for his child?) ought to give it a soup or
sauce made of goat's flesh ({#‘AjamannAdyakAmaH’#}); if he de-
sire holiness, a soup or sauce made of the flesh of a fran-
coline patridge, called tittiri ({#‘tEttiraM brahmavarcasakAmaH’#}); if
he desire strength, boiled rice sprinkled over with very
little clarified butter, but not fried in butter, as it would
then not be moist ({#‘GftOdanaM tejaskAmaH’#}) [The restriction
made by the comm. in his explanation of the word {#GftOdana#}
is not justified by himself, but countenanced by the gloss of
Patanjali on a Vārttika ({#‘saMpratyayAcca tadarTADyavasAnam’#}) to
Pāṇini II. 1. 34]; or if he have no particular desire, boiled
rice mixed with curdled milk, honey and clarified butter
({#‘daDimaDuGftamiSramannaM prASayet’#}). [The word {#anna#} supplied
at {#Aja#} and {#tEttira#} is, as the comm. observes, not to be
taken there in its usual sense ‘boiled rice’ but in that of
soup or sauce, {#vyaYjana#}.] When giving the food, whatever
be its substance, the father speaks the verse: {#annapate'nnasya#}
{#no dehyanamIvasya SuzmiRaH#} &c. (Vājas. Sanh. 11. 83.), if the
child is a boy; if it is a girl, the ceremony is performed
without the recital of the mantra ({#‘AvftEva kumAryE’#}).--
According to the school of Kātyāyana the food varies still
more according to the nature of the desires: that cor-
responding with the desire of eloquence is the flesh (pro-
bably the sauce made of the flesh of) a skylark ({#BaradvAjI#});
with the desire of plenty, that of a partridge, called {#ka-#}
{#piYjala;#} with the desire of quickness that of a fish; with
the desire of long life that of the partridge called {#kfkaRA;#}
with the desire of holiness that of the Śaralī bird ({#AwI#});
with the desire of all the advantages mentioned before that
of all these animals together; the dish must moreover in
general contain honey, clarified butter and bits of gold
(Reṇuka in his Gṛhyakārikā: {#‘maDvAjyakanakopetaM sarvaM tadyuga-#}
{#patpraBuH . mAMsaM tacca BaradvAjyA yadIcCedvAkprasAritAm . kA-#}
{#piYjalaM cedannAdyaM mAtsyaM ca javanaM yadi . AyuScetkfkaRAyASca#}
{#tadAwyAScedbrahmavarcasam . sarvaM cetsarvamAMsAni sahAnnaM prASayecCu-#}
{#Bam’#}); the ceremony is performed while a mantra is in-
audibly muttered and the child is sitting on the lap of its
mother before the divinity of the family; preparatory pro-
cedings are, according to Reṇuka, those connected with
the fixing of an auspicious day, the Ābhyudayika-śrāddha
(the same as the Vṛddhi-Śr.), austerities, as suspending
the breath, meditation on the divinity and oblations (āhutis)
with clarified butter while remembering the divine powers
of speech ({#vAc#}), the vital airs {#prARa#} and {#apAna,#} eye
({#cakzus#}) and ear ({#Srotra#}), lastly an oblation of {#caru#} (q. v.)
to Agni ({#agniH svizwakft#}).--According to Bhavadeva, as
quoted by Rādhākānta, the order of the procedings is:
fixing of an auspicious day, ablutions, performance of the
Vṛddhi-Śrāddha, collecting of the sacrificial fire, making
[Page135-b+ 56]
a heap of Kuśagrass(?) (acc. to Reṇuka: of fifty leaves of
this grass), then silently throwing into the fire a piece of
fuel smeared with clarified butter, of a span's length, then
the oblation (homa) which is accompanied with the three
sacred words bhūr, bhuvar and svar, then five oblations
(āhutis) with clarified butter, then the homa of the five vital
airs ({#prARa#}), or instead of the two latter(?) the ceremony
practised in the north which begins with the Śāṭyāyana-
homa and ends with the hymn called Vāmadevya; these
procedings are followed by the essential rite of giving the
food and by, what is essential too, the presents to the of-
ficiating priest. (Comp. also {#annaBukti#}.) E. {#anna#} and {#prASana#}.
