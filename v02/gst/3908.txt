Sāyaṇa explains {#antarvA#} as meaning liter. ‘going within,
[Page126-b+ 56]
being within, belonging to’ and thus assuming the sense of
treasure &c.; he makes it optional, however, to consider
in the latter instance {#antarvAvat#} as representing also {#anta-#}
{#rvAvad,#} when the word would come from {#antar#} and {#vAvad#}
‘speaking much’ the intens. of {#vad,#} kṛt aff. {#kvip,#} the
sense remaining the same, but the word being then a
Tatpurusha.
