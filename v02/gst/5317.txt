{#apoha#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-haH#}) Removing, taking off; e. g. in the
{%Jaiminīya-nyāyam.:%} {#viSizwasya yadAdAnamanyApohena vastunaH .#}
{#arTAntaranyAsavatI parivfttirasO yaTA#}. Comp. {#apohana#} and
{#vyapoha#}. <sup>2</sup> Reasoning away, i. e. a reasoning which {%removes%}
one object from another or {%disconnects%} two objects; the re-
verse of {#Uha,#} the reasoning which establishes a relation
between two objects, i. e. which {%connects%} them (for the de-
tailed explanation of the latter term see, however, s. v. {#Uha#});
e. g. on the words of the {%Bhāgav. Purāṇa%} which speak of
the difference between Soul and Body: {#‘dehastu sarvasaMGAto#}
{#jagattasTuriti dviDA . atrEva mfgyaH puruzo neti netItyatattya-#}
{#jan’#} {%Śrīdharasvāmin%} observes: {#neti netItyanyApohe kriya-#}
{#mARe#} &c.; or in the {%Siddhāntamuktāvalī:%} {#apoharUpo nIla-#}
{#tvAdirvijYAnaDarma iti cet . na . nIlatvAdInAM virudDAnAme-#}
{#kasminnasamAveSAt#} ‘are blue, yellow and similar qualities
such properties of knowledge as must be disconnected from
it by reasoning? no, for contrary notions as blue, yellow &c.
cannot take place (at the same time in the same thing)’;
the Dwandwa {#UhApoha#} ‘positive and negative reasoning,
reasoning which {%connects%} and reasoning which {%disconnects’%}
is therefore also used in the sense of ‘thorough or clever
reasoning, sharpness or cleverness of intellect’; e. g. in
{%Bharatasena%} on a verse of the {%Bhaṭṭik.:%} {#UhApohakzamErna SukA-#}
{#divadaDItavaktftvam;#} or {%Mādhava%} says of a work on car-
pentry: {#UhApohakuSalapuruzotprekzAmUlA takzasmftirna vedaM kalpa-#}
{#yituM praBavati#}.--{%Hemachandra%} calls {#apoha#} one of the eight
qualities of intellect ({#SuSrUzA SravaRaM cEva grahaRaM DAraRaM taTA#}
{#Uho'poho'rTavijYAnaM tattvajYAnaM ca DIguRAH#}), but this piece
of psychology seems to belong to him as exclusively as his
definition of {#apAna#}. E. {#Uh#} with {#apa,#} kṛt aff. {#GaY#}.
