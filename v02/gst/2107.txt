{#aDyuzwavalaya#}¦ Bahuvr. m. ({#-yaH#}) Having the ringlets coiled,
wound into rings. This word occurs in the poem Ānanda-
laharī as the epithet of a serpent, to indicate that it is in
profound sleep, forming, then, three ringlets and a half;
the god Śiva is likened to a serpent coiled up in this man-
ner, its half ringlet being compared to his Śakti or female
energy and the three others to the god as representing the
Trimūrti. E. {#aDyuzwa#} and {#valaya#}.
