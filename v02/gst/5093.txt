{#apAnat#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-n-tI-t#}) Inhaling, producing the
function of the vital air {#apAna#} q. v.--In the verse of the
{%Bhāgav. Pur.%} (2. 10. 16.) {#anu prARanti yaM prARAH prARantaM sarva-#}
{#jantuzu . apAnantamapAnanti naradevamivAnugAH,#} it deserves no-
tice that {%Srīdharasvāmin%} takes the word {#apAnat#} in the sense
‘ceasing to perform vital functions’, viz. ‘they (according to
the comm., the senses) cease to exercise their functions when
it (the vital air {#prARa#}) ceases to perform its function’: {#prARA#}
{#indriyARi yaM#} (scil. {#prARaM,#} the word of the preceding verse)
{#prARantaM cezwAM kurvantamanu paScAtprARanti cezwAM kurvanti . apAnantaM#}
{#cezwAM tyajantamanu apAnanti cezwAM tyajanti . rAjAnamanu BftyA iva;#}
but it seems very doubtful whether he is correct in this con-
struction of the verse, as {#prARAH#} might be taken in the
general sense ‘vital airs’, and the sense ‘they perform the
function of exhaling and inhaling according to the function
[Page186-b+ 56]
of life ({#prARa#})’ would be in conformity with the usual mean-
ing of the words in question. E. {#an#} with {#apa,#} kṛt aff. {#Satf#}.
