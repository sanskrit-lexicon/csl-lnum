{#aBIzwa#}¦ Tatpur. 1. m. f. n. ({#-zwaH-zwA-zwam#}) <sup>1</sup> Longed for, dear,
beloved; ({%Rāyam.%} on the {%Amarak.:%} {#aBi punaH . punarizwama-#}

{#stvayyupAgate;#} or {#utkArezu ca DAnyAnAmanaBIzwaparigrahAH#} (scil.
{#yUyaM yAta#}). <sup>3</sup> Optional, arbitrary, any one or any one
thing of several; e. g. {%Lilāvatī:%} {#[dviDA BavedrUpaviBAga evaM]#}

parately by the places of figures and add the products to-
gether. Or multiply by the multiplicator diminished or
increased by a quantity {%arbitrarily%} assumed; adding or
subtracting the product of the multiplicand taken into the

negative surd-root in the square, treating that irrational
quantity as an affirmative one, let the two surds in the

<div n="P">2. m. ({#-zwaH#}) A beloved person, a sweetheart; said

<div n="P">3. f. ({#-zwA#}) <sup>1</sup> A beloved woman, a mistress. <sup>2</sup> Betel
(Piper betel); see {#tAmbUlI#}. [{%Wilson'%}s {%first ed.%} and {%Rādhāk.'%}s
{%Śabdakalpadr.%} give the meaning {%‘perfume’%} and refer for
its being a synonyme of {#reRukA#} to the authority of the
{%Śabdachandrikā;%} but this reference contains an error, caused
perhaps by an omission of a copyist of the {%Śabdachandrikā.%}
The latter vocabulary has been composed by {%Chakrapāṇi-%}
{%datta%} with a view of being a supplement to the {%Amarak.;%}
it does not contain as much matter as this vocabulary nor
does it follow {%throughout%} its order; but in certain portions it
{%has%} the same order and it gives always literally the text of
the {%Amarak.,%} wherever additional synonymes have been
intended by the author, these synonymes being either im-
mediately annexed by him to the words of the {%Amarak.%}
in a subsequent verse or pointed out through the repetition
of the word to be enlarged upon, which then is put in the
locative. The end of the enumeration is marked by the
repetition of the word synonymized, between two full stops.
Thus the Śloka of the {%Amarak.%} II. 4. 4. 8. which contains,
up to {#nAgavallI,#} synonymes of ‘piper betel’, and afterwards
those of the perfume {#reRukA#} (viz. {#tAmbUlavallI tAmbUlI nAga-#}
{#vallyapyaTa dvijA . hareRU reRukA kOntI kapilA BasmaganDinI#})
runs thus in the {%Bodleian%} copy of the {%Śabdach.,%} of Professor
{%Wilson'%}s collection: {#tAmbUlavallI tAmbUlI nAgavallyapyaTA dvijA .#}
{#hareRU reRukA kOntI kapilA BasmaganDinI . tAmbUlyAM kawukABIzwA#}
{#devABIzwA gfhASayA#} (these four words mean therefore {%Betel%}) {#.#}
{#reRukAyAM BavejjyotsnI kftAntA KaranAdinI . varAvaramuKI#}
{#pucCArSoGnI SyAmA varatkarI#} (and these eight words the per-
fume {%Reṇukā%}) {#.. reRukAKye ganDadravye ..#}. The mentioned Ms.
omits, as may be observed, (contrary to its practice, and
merely from carelessness of the copyist,) the ending word,
{#.. tAmbUlI ..,#} before {#reRukAyAM,#} and as it has served both,
Professor {%Wilson%} and {%Rādhākaṇtadeva,%} the oversight be-
comes thus explainable.]
<div n="P">4. n. ({#-zwam#}) <sup>1</sup> A desired object, desire; e. g. {%Sāhityad.:%}

{#KyAto raGorvaMSaH kva tvaM paragfhozitA . anyasmE hfdayaM dehi#}
{#nAnaBIzwe GawAmahe#} ({%Jayam.:%} = {#anaBimate vizaye;#} {%Bharatas.:%}
= {#anucite vastuni#}). <sup>2</sup> The name of a plant; see {#tilaka;#}
(according to the {%Nigh. Prak.;%} but as the gender is not
given in this work, it is doubtful whether the word is in
this sense a {%m.%} or a {%n.%}). E. {#iz#} with {#aBi,#} kṛt aff. {#kta;#}
in the first meaning perhaps better {#aBi#} and {#izwa#}.
