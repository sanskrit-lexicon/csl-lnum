{#vfttaye yaH#} ({%comm.:%} {#indrasyerzyAnirAkaraRArTam#}). [The learned
Paṇḍits who partly complied and partly composed the
comm. on the present edition of {%Pāṇini%} seem to have
employed {#aByasUyA#} in the sense of ‘abuse, reproof’, or:
‘derision’, when they observe on {%Pāṇ.%} VIII. 2. 94.: {#adya#}
{#amAvasyA#} (the opinion of the person which, as the inter-
locutor has shown, is wrong) {#ityevaM vAdI yuktyA svamatAtpra-#}
{#cyAvya sAByasUyamanuyoktrEvamanuyujyate,#} for there is neither {%ca-%}
{%lumny%} nor {%envy%} in what the {%anuyoktṛ%} says, but only {%reproof%}
or perhaps {%derision;%} on what authority they have used the
word in this sense is unknown to me, for there is no com-
ment on the Sūtra by {%Kāty.%} and {%Patanj.%} &c., and the {%Kāś.%}
and {%Siddhk.%} write: {#adyAmAvAsyetyevaM vAdinaM yuktyA pracyAvya#}
{#svamatAdevamanuyujyate#}.]--The same as {#asUyA;#} {%Śabdārnava:%}
{#asUyA tvaByasUyA ca;#} as quoted also by {%Bhānud.,%} &c. on the
{%Amarak.;%} the latter work, however, and its comment., as
well as other {%old%} authorities do not allow {#asUyA#} to be a
synonyme of {#Irzya#} ‘envy’, but restrict its sense to the first
meaning. See s. v. {#asUyA#}.--E. {#asU (N)#} with {#aBi,#} kṛt
aff. {#a#}.
