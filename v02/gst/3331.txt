{#anuvAda#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-daH#}) <sup>1</sup> Reference or referring to what
has been previously said, not in the way of a mere repetition
or tautology, but in that of explanation, detailed comment
or emphasis; explanatory and corroborative reference, ex-
planation; e. g. {#BUpariDimAnAnuvAdaH#} ‘a detailed explanation
with reference to the measure of the earth's circumference
(mentioned before in the Golādhyāya)’; or, in Manu 2. 53.
the words {#KAni saMspfSet#} are an {#anuvAda#} to {#nivedya#} &c. 2. 51.,
because they give a detailed illustration of the general in-
junction contained in the latter verse. If a word is repeated
or an expression used which would seem superfluous, be-
cause not conveying a new notion, such repeated word or
[Page103-a+ 56]
such expression is {#anuvAda,#} provided a certain purpose be
connected with it, otherwise it would be simply {#punarukta#} or
a meaningless tautology, e. g. {#Gawo GawaH#} or {#GawaH kalasaH#} ‘a
jar is a jar’ would be a {#punarukta;#} but the repetition of {#paSyet#}
in Yājnav. 2. 1. from 1. 359. is an {#anuvAdaH#} because it points
to the connexion between both passages and to the detail
which is to follow as an illustration of 1. 359.; or in Manu
1. 72. {#parisaMKyayA#} might be taken as an {#anuvAda#} to {#sahasraM,#}
because it imparts greater emphasis to the bare numeral.
<sup>2</sup> In the ritual literature {#anuvAda#} designates those passages
of the Brāhmaṇa portion of the Vedas, which point to an
injunction given before ({#viDi#} q. v.) and illustrate it by the
way of comment, or by entering into greater detail, or by
adding supplementary rules, but without stating the purpose
of the injunction itself as the latter would be the object of
the {#arTavAda#} (q. v.); the {#anuvAda#} being accessory, therefore,
to the {#viDi#} portion of the Brāhmaṇa and precluded from
giving independent regulations, the supplementary rites they
contain are not considered of equal weight and as absolute
as those of the {#viDi;#} there exists however sometimes a
difficulty to decide whether a passage of the Brāhmaṇas is
{#viDi#} or {#anuvAda,#} or in other words whether its injunctions
are absolute or not, as appears from the discussion of the
Mīmānsists. (The Nyāya, supported by the commentaries
on the Mīmānsā, distribute the text of the Brāhmaṇa under
the three heads of {#viDi, anuvAda#} and {#arTavAda#} qq. vv.; a
later division makes {#anuvAda#} one of the three categories
of the {#arTavAda#}.) <sup>3</sup> Report, e. g. {#kutsitArTAnuvAdaH#}. <sup>4</sup> Abuse,
reviling (? this meaning is given by several dictionaries on
the authority of the Śabdaratnāvalī, but, to judge from
the Mss. at my disposal, it would seem to proceed from
another reading or from a misunderstanding of the passage
of this work which contains the synonymes of ‘rumour’:
{#yaTArTAniScitA vArttA BavetsarvajanAtmikA . kutsitArTAnuvAdo#}
{#vA kiMvadantI janaSrutiH ..;#} the same might be said of the
meanings ‘abusive reply’ and ‘divulging another's misdeeds’
which occur also in some dictionaries). E. {#vad#} with {#anu,#}
kṛt aff. {#GaY#} or {#anu#} and {#vAda#}.
