{#antarAgama#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-maH#}) (In Grammar.) An āgama or
additional letter which is inserted between two letters; e. g.
{#v#} when it is inserted between a final {#a#} or {#A#} and a fol-
[Page121-a+ 56]
lowing non-labial vowel, after {#a#} or {#A#} have become the
representatives of {#o#} or {#O#}--the native theory being that
these latter vowels do not become {#av#} and {#Av#} but {#a#} and
{#A#} before a vowel in general. E. {#antar#} and {#Agama#}.
