{#anuttamAmBasika#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-kam#}) A technical term in the
Sāṅkhya philosophy denoting one of the five sorts of ex-
ternal acquiescence or indifference (see {#tuzwi#}), viz. that con-
dition of mind in which a man abstains from sensual enjoy-
ments on the ground that it is sinful to injure created things,
enjoyment however being impossible without doing so. Some
call this indifference {#uttamAmBas#}. Compare the preceding and
the terms named there. E. {#anuttama#} and {#AmBasika(?)#}.
