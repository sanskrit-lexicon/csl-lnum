{#anarvan#}¦ Bahuvr. m. ({#-rvA#}) (ved.) <sup>1</sup> Not moving, fixed. <sup>2</sup> Not
passing away, permanent. <sup>3</sup> Without an impediment, not
thwarted, unobstructed. <sup>4</sup> Without an enemy or foe. See
the preceding. (The declension of this word differs from
that of {#arvan#} in so far, as it does not assume the ādeśa {#tf#}
(i. e. {#t#}) which is said to be the substitute of the {#n#} in
{#arvan#} q. v.; e. g. {#anarvARam, anarvARO, anarvARaH#}.) E. {#a#}
priv. and {#arvan#}.
