{#apehivARijA#}¦ Bahuvr. f. ({#-jA#}) A festival or ceremony
where tradespeople are denied admission. The {%Gaṇaratna-%}
{%mahodadhi%} explains this word and the word {#ehivARijA#}
as specimens of the similar formations (see the preceding
and the following articles) which occur in the {%Gaṇa%} {#mayU-#}
{#ravyaMsakAdi#} to {%Pāṇini%} II. 1. 72., in this manner: {#ehi-#}
{#vARijeti yasyAM tiTO kriyAyAM vA sA ehivARijA . keci-#}
{#dAyAnti gacCanti vARijA yasyAmiti vigfhya nipAtanAdehi-#}
{#BAvaH . apehi apasara vARijeti yasyAM#} (Ms. E. I. H. 949.
{#vARije asyAM#} sic) {#sA apehivARijA . evamehisvAgatA . ape-#}
{#hisvAgatA . ehidvitIyA .#} ({#apehidvitIyA#} is omitted, through
carelessness, by the copyist, not by the author) {#. ehivi-#}
{#GasA . apehiviGasA .#} ({#ehipraGasA#} and {#apehipraGasA#} are omit-
ted by the copyist, not by the author) {#. ehiprakasA . ape-#}
{#hiprakasA . apehi prakasaM dUramiti yasyAM#} ({#sA#} omitted) {#ape-#}
{#hiprakasA iti SAkawAyanaH#}. This explanation and the words
enumerated (except the two latter) are in conformity with
the {%Vārttika:%} {#apehi ca vARijasvAgatadvitIyaviGasapraGasAdi-#}
{#BiH kriyAyAm,#} which the {%Kāśikā%} comments upon: {#ape-#}
{#hyAKyAtaM vARijasvAgatadvitIyaviGasapraGasAdiBiH saha sama-#}
{#syate . cakArAdehIti ca . ehivARijeti yasyAM kriyAyAM sA#}
{#ehivARijA . apehivARijA#} &c. The word {#apehikawA#}
which occurs in the present edition of Pāṇini, and there-
fore in the reprint of that edition, is neither mentioned in
the {%Gaṇar.%} nor in the {%Kāśikā%} and becomes doubtful when
compared with such formations as {#AharakarawA, prohakarawA#}
(the latter being the reading of the {%Kāśikā%} instead of {#pre-#}
{#hikawA#}); the word {#apehivAta,#} although of an analogous
formation, belongs to a different category, the ellipsis being
probably {#ozaDi#} or {#latA,#} and does not occur in any of the
lists referring to the mentioned Gaṇa.--From the quoted
comment it results that all these compounds have to be
analyzed literally as meaning a {#kriyA#} or proceeding in which
an injunction is uttered or implied, the component parts
[Page204-a+ 56]
being originally a sentence, e. g. {#apehi vARija#} ‘be off
tradesman’, {#apehi prakasam#} ‘go far away’ &c. and hence
{#apehivARijA#} &c. festivals where such people are kept off
or kept at a distance.--E. {#apehi#} (imper. of {#i#} with {#apa#})
and {#vARija,#} scil. {#kriyA#}.
