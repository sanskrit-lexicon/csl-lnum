{#aTarvan#}¦ 1. m. ({#-rvA#}) <sup>1</sup> A Brāhmaṇa, a priest (probably one
connected with offerings to fire or the attendance on the
holy fire). <sup>2</sup> The proper name of a priest who is considered
to have obtained the fire from heaven and who in the course
of mythological personification appears as a Prajāpati or
father of all beings, as the inspired author of the fourth
or Atharvaveda, as the eldest son of Brahmā to whom
Brahmā revealed the Brahmavidyā (q. v.) or knowledge of
God (see also {#aTarva#}) and, at a later period, as the same
as Angiras (q. v.). Sons of his are Agni (see also {#aNgiras#}),
Dadhyanch, Bhishaj, Bṛhaddiva, Kabandha. <sup>3</sup> An epithet of
<sup>a.</sup> Vasiṣṭha q. v., <sup>b.</sup> Soma q. v., <sup>c.</sup> {#prARa#} q. v., <sup>d.</sup> Śiva (the god being
supposed to carry into effect the charms of the Atharvaveda).
<div n="P">2. m. n. ({#-rvA-rva#}) The fourth or Atharvaveda q. v. (see
also m. pl. {#aTarvARaH#}).
<div n="P">3. m. pl. ({#-rvARaH#}) <sup>1</sup> The descendants of Atharvan; they
appear sometimes coupled with the descendants of Bhṛgu
and of Angiras (see {#aTarvANgirasaH#}). <sup>2</sup> The hymns of the
fourth or Atharvaveda collectively (considered as the descen-
dants of Atharvan); the Atharvaveda (see also {#aTarvANgi-#}
{#rasaH#}). E. From an obsolete theme {#aTar,#} fire, with taddh.
aff. {#vanip#}. See the E. of {#aTarI#}. The oldest etym. which
derives {#aTarvan#} from {#a#} neg. and {#Tarvan#} (from {#Tarv#} ‘to go’),
is without any probability. A similar etym. is given of
{#aTarvI#} q. v.
