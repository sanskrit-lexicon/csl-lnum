{#apehisvAgatA#}¦ Bahuvr. f. ({#-sA#}) A festival or ceremony
where undesired or uninvited people are denied admission.
See the explanation s. v. {#apehivARijA#}. (This meaning is
hypothetical; but as all the similar formations mentioned
in the last named article imply the shutting out of un-
desired objects, it will seem that {#svAgata#} is either to be taken
in this compound as {#su-Agata#} ‘welcome’ in an ironical
sense--comp. e. g. {#satya, sADu--,#} or as {#sva-Agata#} ‘come
on one's own account, uninvited’.) E. {#apehi#} (imper. of {#i#}
with {#apa#}) and {#svAgata,#} scil. {#kriyA#}.
