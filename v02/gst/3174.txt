{#anuBAva#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-vaH#}) <sup>1</sup> Dignity, authority, power (such
as results from wealth, a magisterial position &c.). <sup>2</sup> Cer-
tainty, resolution (only in the positive sense of a good re-
solution, e. g. {#mahAnuBAva#} q. v.). <sup>3</sup> (In rhetorical terminology.)
‘A symptom which indicated the feeling ({#BAva#}) produced
by its appropriate causes’. These causes being naturally
various from the character ({#rasa#}) of a poetical composition,
the rhetorical works enumerate the anubhāvas which are
the concomitants of the different sorts of rasas; thus the
symptoms of the Erotic ({#SfNgAra#}) are according to them,
motion of the eye-brows, side-glances &c.; of the Comic
({#hAsya#}), blinking with the eye, smiles &c.; of the Pathetic
({#karuRa#}), cursing one's fate, falling to the ground, crying
&c.; of the Terrible ({#rOdra#}), abuse, fierce looks &c.; of the
Heroic ({#vIra#}), looking for a companion &c.; of the Fearful
({#BayAnaka#}), change of colour, stammering &c.; of the Dis-
gustful ({#bIBatsa#}), spitting, contracting the mouth, shutting
the eyes &c.; of the Wonderful ({#adButa#}), wide opening of
the eyes &c.; of the Quietistic ({#SAnta#}), horripilation (sic)
&c.; of the Affectionate ({#vatsala#}), horripilation, joy, tears
&c.--Compare {#BAva#} and {#viBAva#}. E. {#anu#} and {#BAva,#} lit.
‘following or connected with condition, feeling &c.’.
