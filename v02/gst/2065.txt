{#aDyavasAna#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-nam#}) <sup>1</sup> Determining, ascertaining. <sup>2</sup> Effort,
energy. <sup>3</sup> (In rhetoric.) The simple enunciation of elliptic
or figurative speech without qualifying it by epithets &c.,
as it were, leaving it on its own effort; such sentences as
{#Sveto DAvati#} ‘the white (horse) gallops’, {#kuntAH praviSanti#}
‘(men with) lances enter’ (see also under {#ajahatsvArTA#}), or
{#kaliNgaH sAhasikaH#} ‘the (inhabitant of) Kalinga is impetuous’
(see also under {#jahatsvArTA#}) would be lakṣaṇās or elliptic
expressions by {#aDyavasAna,#} while {#aSvaH Sveto DAvati#} the
white horse gallops, {#ete kuntAH praviSanti#} these (men with)
lances enter, {#kaliNgaH puruzo yuDyate#} the man (inhabitant of)
Kalinga fights would be qualified or lakṣaṇās by {#Aropa#}
q. v. (See also under {#lakzaRA#}.) Or {#muKaM dvitIyaScandraH,#} (her)
face is another moon, would be an {#atiSayokti#} (q. v.) or
hyperbole in virtue of {#aDyavasAna,#} the comparison as it
were resting on its own merit. E. {#so#} with {#ava#} and {#aDi,#}
kṛt aff. {#lyuw#}.
