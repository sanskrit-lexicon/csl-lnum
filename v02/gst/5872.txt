{#aBavanmatayoga#}¦ I. Karmadh. m. ({#-gaH#}) (In Rhetoric.) One of
the twenty one defects to be avoided in the composition of
a sentence (see {#doza#} and {#vAkyadoza#}); viz. not conveying ac-
curately by a sentence the intended sense, <sup>a.</sup> by connecting
syntactically words which have no logical relation to each
other, or <sup>b.</sup> by disconnecting syntactically words which are
logically connected, or <sup>c.</sup> by erring in the mode of con-
nexion; e. g. <sup>a.</sup> in the sentence {#yezAM tAstridaSeBadAnasaritaH#}
{#pItAH pratApozmaBirlIlApAnaBuvaSca candanatarucCAyAsu yEH ka-#}
{#lpitAH . yezAM huMkftayaH kftAmarapatikzoBAH kzapAcAriRAM kiM#}
{#tEstvatparitozakAri vihitaM kiMcitpravAdocitam#} there is no
logical relation between the words in the relative and those
in the correlative sentence; or in the sentence {#anena cCi-#}
{#ndatA mAtuH kaRWaM paraSunA tava . badDasparSaH kfpARo'yaM la-#}
{#jjate mama BArgava,#} the word {#paraSu,#} although intended to ex-
press the reason, has no logical connexion with the blame
[Page235-a+ 56]
uttered against Paraśurāma; (thus the old critics: the mo-
dern critics however find no fault with this sentence); or
<sup>b.</sup> in the verse {#yA jayaSrIrmanojasya yayA jagadalaMkftam . yAme-#}
{#RAkzIM vinA prARA viPalA me kuto'dya sA,#} the word {#eRA-#}
{#kzIm#} ought to stand in the correlative sentence so as to
become connected with the {%three%} preceding relative sen-
tences which it is not now; (the {%Sāhityad.%} proposes to mend
the latter part of this Śloka thus: {#yAM vinAmI vfTA prARA#}
{#eRAkzI sA kuto'dya me#}); or <sup>c.</sup> in the verse {#jyotsnA ca yaH#}
{#payaHpUrastArakAH kEravARi ca . rAjati vyomakAsArarAjahaMsaH#}
{#suDAkaraH,#} the word {#kAsAra#} standing in the same relation
to {#vyoma,#} as {#payaHpUra#} to {#jyotsnA#} &c., it ought not to be part
of a compound, as this kind of syntax would affect the
whole simile; or in the sentence {#Ikzase yatkawAkzeRa tadA DanvI#}
{#manoBavaH#} the connexion between the two sentences ought
not to have been effected by {#yad--tadA,#} but by {#cet--#}
{#tadA#}. See also {#aBavanmatasaMbanDa#}.
<div n="P">II. Bahuvr. n. ({#-gam#}) A sentence in which this defect
occurs. E. {#a-Bavat-mata#} and {#yoga;#} the Bahuvr. scil. {#vAkya;#}
(the word does not occur as a Karmadh., but only as a
Bahuvr., in the {%Kāvyaprakāśa;%} comp. the following).
