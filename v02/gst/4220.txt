{#anyatkAma#}¦ Bahuvr. m. f. n. ({#-maH-mA-mam#}) Having desire for
something else; comp. {#anyakAma#}. (The correctness of this
word is doubtful, as it is not mentioned by Pāṇini amongst
those compounds in which {#anya#} retains the {#d#} of its neuter;
see s. v. {#anya#}.) E. {#anya,#} āgama {#duk#} and {#kAma#}.
