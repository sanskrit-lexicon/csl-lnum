{#apalyUlanakfta#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-taH-tA-tam#}) Not cleaned with
alkaline substances (as the garment of a man who is initiated
for a sacrifice).--The present edition of the {%Śatapathabr.%}
where the word occurs (III. 1. 2. 19.), gives it in the shape
[Page175-b+ 56]
of {#apalpUlanakfta,#} but although it may be difficult sometimes
to distinguish a {#y#} from a {#p#} in Devanāg. Mss., the form
{#apalyU°#} is doubtless the correct one, since the reading of the
radical {#palyUl#} (wherefrom {#palyUlanaM = SoDanadravyam#} Mādhava)
is safe through its occurring also in Beṅgāli writing.--
E. {#a#} neg. and {#palyUlana-kfta#}.
