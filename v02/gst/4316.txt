{#anyA#}.¦ The feminine of {#anya#} ‘other, different’ &c. q. v. This
word deserves notice only from the circumstance that it oc-
curs in some vaidik passages with the udātta accent on the
first syllable, instead of having this accent on the last syllable.
[Sāyaṇa is not the author of the meaning ‘never drying-up’
and of an etym. ‘{#a#} and {#nyA,#} contracted of {#ni-yA#}’ which have
been lent to this word by a new kind of vaidik exegesis.]
