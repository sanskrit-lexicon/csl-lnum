{#aBinaya#}¦ Tatpur. 1. m. ({#-yaH#}) Action and postures expressive
of sentiment, especially when exhibited in a dramatic per-
formance; dramatic representation; it is fourfold: {#ANgika#}
or conveyed by bodily action, as by attitude, gesture &c.,
{#vAcika#} by speech, {#AhArya#} by dress, decorations &c. and
{#sAttvika#} by the spontaneous manifestation of feelings, as
by perspiration, horripilation, inarticulate speech &c.; e. g.
{%Vikramorv.:%} {#lalitABinayaM tamadya BartA marutAM drazwumanAH sa-#}
{#lokapAlaH;#} or a quotation by the {%Sāhityad.:%} {#yasmAdaBinayo#}
{#hyatra prATamyAdavatAryate . raNgadvAramato jYeyaM vAgaNgABinayA-#}
{#tmakam#}. The term {#aBinaya#} as applying merely to the {%means%}
of a dramatic representation is therefore distinct from the
term {#rUpaka#} (and its subdivisions) q. v. which belongs to the
{%contents%} of the representation or to the drama itself, both
being the categories which distinguish the ‘poem to be
seen’ from the ‘poem to be heard’; {%Sāhityad.:%} {#dfSyaSravya-#}

tinguishes the {#aBinaya#} only as {#ANgika#} and {#sAttvika;#} {%He-%}
{%mach.%} has the same definition as the {%Sāhityad.%}).
