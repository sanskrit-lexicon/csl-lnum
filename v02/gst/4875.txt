{#apalApin#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-pI-pinI-pi#}) I. Denying, con-
cealing. E. {#lap#} with {#apa,#} kṛt aff. {#Rini#}.
<div n="P">II. Deceiving, cheating; e. g. {#sADAraRasyApalApI#} ‘one
who cheats another out of their common property, viz. by
appropriating it to himself alone’; (in {%Yājnav.%} 2. 236.: {%Mi-%}
{%tākṣ.%} = {#sADAraRadravyasya vaYcakaH#}. {%Stenzler%} in his valuable
edition of Yājn. renders these words, {%‘one who conceals pu-%}
{%blic property’;%} but the meaning {#‘vaYcaka’#} of the comm. does not
permit the word to be derived {%in this sense%} from {#apalap-#}--
comp. {#apalApayamAna#} and the meanings of {#lI#} in the caus.,
{%Pāṇ.%} I. 3. 70.--; moreover the {%Vivādachint.%} which quotes
the passage from Yājn., p. 98, explains the foregoing words
p. 99: {#anyasADAraRaDanamasADAraRIkftya gfhlan,#} connecting
them logically with the offence named 2. 237., the latter part
of which verse the {%Vivādach.%} quotes: {#‘ezAmapatitAnAM ca#}
{#tyAgI ca SatadaRqaBAk’,#} introducing however in the expla-
nation the word {#anyonyatyAgI#} which does not seem justified
by this reading). E. {#lI,#} in the caus., with {#apa,#} kṛt aff. {#Rini#}.
