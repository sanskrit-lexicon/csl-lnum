{#aNguzWa#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-zWaH#}) <sup>1</sup> The thumb. <sup>2</sup> The great toe. <sup>3</sup> A
thumb's breadth, as a linear measure which is said to be
a measure of six barley corns. This seems, however, not
to be correct, because twelve aṅguṣṭhas are given by the
same authority as equal to a Vitasti or span. See {#aNgula#}.
E. {#aNgu#} here said to mean the hand, and {#sTa#}.
