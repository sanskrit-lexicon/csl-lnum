{#antadIpaka#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-kam#}) (In Rhetoric.) One of the
alaṅkāras or modes of writing or speaking elegantly, a
variety of the alaṅkāra {#dIpaka#} q. v.; viz. when a variegated
description reposes on, and is illustrated as it were by, a
verb which is placed at the end of the sentence. (It would
seem that the injunction of the principal rhetorical works
according to which there must be several verbs and but
one subject in a {#dIpaka#} has not been considered as absolute,
as results from this instance: {#sa giriM taruzaRqamaRqitaM#}
{#samavApya tvarayA latAmfgaH . smitadarSitakAryaniScayaH kapisE-#}
{#nyErmuditEramaRqayat#} where there is but one verb viz. {#amaRqa-#}
{#yat#} which has the properties required in this {#dIpaka#}. Com-
pare also {#AdidIpaka, maDyadIpaka, pratIpadIpaka#} and {#mAlAdI-#}
{#paka#}.) E. {#anta#} and {#dIpaka#}.
