{#anumAna#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-nam#}) <sup>1</sup> Inferring, as the cause of {#anumiti#}
or of a conclusion drawn from given premises. According to
the Sāṅkhya and Yoga-philosophies it is one of the {%three%}
means (see {#pramARa#}) by which true knowledge may be ob-
tained (see also {#pratyakza#} or {#dfzwa#} and {#Agama#} or {#Aptavacana#});
according to the Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika phil., one of the
{%four%} means for this end (see also {#pratyakza, upamAna#} and {#Sabda#}).
Inference may be, according to the definitions of Sāṅkhya
and Nyāya philosophers, either one by induction ({#pUrvavat#})
e. g. that it will rain because clouds have gathered, or one
by analogy ({#sAmAnyato dfzwam#}), e. g. that moon and stars are
locomotive because they change their place and that a person
therefore who changes his place is locomotive; or one by ne-
cessity ({#Sezavat#}), e. g. that the ocean will be salt, because a
drop taken from it, is salt. According to the Vaiśeṣika
philosophers, inference may be either purely consecutive or
positive ({#kevalAnvayin#}), i. e. when the major term is not
excluded by any other notion (comp. {#anupasaMhArin#}), e. g.
all that can be known can be named, because only positive
(not negative instances) can be alleged to prove the asser-
tion; or purely exclusive or negative ({#kevalavyatirekin#}), i. e.
when only negative proof can be adduced, e. g. in asserting
that earth is distinguished from all the other elements, be-
cause it is possessed of the quality of smell, for the ar-
gument would be that all that is not distinguished from
all the other elements, is not possessed of the quality of
[Page098-b+ 56]
smell; or positive and negative ({#anvayavyatirekin#}), i. e.
when there exist positive and negative instances of the major
term, e. g. where there is fire there is smoke, because the
positive argument would be ‘on the hearth’ and the negative
‘in the lake’. (The Mīmānsā and Vedānta philosophies do
not discuss these topics, as inference is not considered by
them to be a means of arriving at true knowledge.) <sup>2</sup> (In
rhetoric.) A logical anakolouthon by the way of inference,
an {#alaMkAra#} or mode of writing elegantly, e. g. ‘wherever
falls the look of woman, there fall sharpened arrows; I
think therefore that the God of Love runs before them while
shooting off his arrows’. E. {#mA#} with {#anu,#} kṛt aff. {#lyuw#}.
