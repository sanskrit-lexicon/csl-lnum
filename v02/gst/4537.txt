{#apacamAna#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-naH#}) A man whose mode of life does
not allow him to cook for himself; {%Kullūka%} names as such
the religious student, the religious mendicant, heretics and
such like people ({#‘apacamAnA brAhmacAriparivrAjakAH pAza-#}
{#RqAdayaH’#}); he observes however that the ‘heretics &c.’ are
included in the definition by {%Medhātithi%} and {%Govindarāja%} who
impart this bearing to {#apacamAna#} in Manu 4. 32, while ac-
cording to his own opinion the word would rather refer in
this passage to the {#snAtaka#} or initiated householder than to
the ‘heretic &c.’--Comp. {#apaca#}. E. {#a#} neg. and {#pacamAna#}.
