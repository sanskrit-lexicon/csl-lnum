{#aDara#}¦ I. m. f. n. ({#-raH-rA-ram#}) <sup>1</sup> Lower, inferior, in place.
(In this sense the word is declined like the sarvanāman {#yat#}
&c. (q. v.), but in the abl. and loc. sing. of the masc. and
neuter and in the nom. plur. of the masc. it forms optionally
{#aDarasmAt#} or {#aDarAt, aDarasmin#} or {#aDare, aDare#} or {#a-#}
{#DarAH;#} it may form Tatpur. compositions with nouns having
the sense of the singular and considered then as depending
upon {#aDara,#} which is the former part of the compound, in
the genitive; for instance {#aDarakAyaH#} is explained, {#aDaraM#}
{#kAyasya#}.) Adverbially used are {#aDarAt, aDarasmAt, aDareRa;#}
qq. vv. <sup>2</sup> Low, vile. <sup>3</sup> Speechless, refuted, overcome in abuse
or controversy. <sup>4</sup> Prior, preceding in time. See {#aDaredyus#}.
<div n="P">II. m. ({#-raH#}) The lower lip, the lip.
<div n="P">III. f. ({#-rA#}) <sup>1</sup> The lower region. <sup>2</sup> The nadir (?).
<div n="P">IV. m. n. ({#-raH-ram#}) Pudendum muliebre. E. Probably
from {#aD#} (see E. of {#aDama#}), aff. {#ara;#} the derivation given
by the native authorities, from {#a#} neg. and {#Dara#} is not correct.
