{#annAyu#}¦ m. ({#-yuH#}) I. Tatpur. Seizing food (see {#anna#} 2. 2.); or
<div n="P">II. Bahuvr. Living through food (see {#anna#} 2. 2.); an epithet
of the vital air {#apAna#} q. v., in the Aitareya Upanishad,
because it alone was capable to seize the primitive food,
created from the waters by the Supreme Soul, after speech,
the vital air {#prARa#} q. v., eye, ear, skin (i. e. touch), manas and
the generative organ were unable to take possession of, and
thus of preserving, life through it. In the passage alluded
to there is a quibble on the word {#Ayu,#} according to its
having the sense of ‘obtaining’ from the corresponding
meaning of the rad. {#I, vI,#} or the sense of {#Ayus#} ‘life’;
as the word occurs in the nomin. {#annAyuH,#} it may, as a
Bahuvr., represent also the form {#annAyus#}. The radical {#I#}
having the same meaning as {#vI#} and probably being identical
with it in origin, the words {#vayat#} and {#vAyu#} ‘air or taking’,
in the same passage, complete the double sense of the pun:
‘{#tad#} (i. e. {#annaM#}) {#apAnenAjiGfkzattadA vayat . sa ezo'nnasya#}
{#graho#} (comm. = {#annagrAhakaH#}) {#yadvAyurannAyurvA eza yadvAyuH;#}
comm.: {#yo vAyurannAyurannabanDano'nnajIvano vE prasidDaM sa eza#}
{#yo vAyuH#}. E. {#anna#} and {#Ayu#}.
