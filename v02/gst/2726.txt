{#anirudDa#}¦ Tatpur. 1. m. f. n. ({#-dDaH-dDA-dDam#}) <sup>1</sup> Unobstructed,
unrestrained. <sup>2</sup> Self-willed, ungovernable, headstrong. <sup>3</sup> Move-
able, unsteady(?).
<div n="P">2. m. ({#-dDaH#}) <sup>1</sup> The name of the son of Pradyumna or
Kāmadeva by Śubhāṅgī or, according to others, Kaku-
dvatī, the daughter of Rukmin; his wife is Uṣā, the
daughter of Vāna, or, according to others, Subhadrā, the
granddaughter of Rukmin, and his son Vajra.--The
Vaiṣṇava sect, called Pāñcharātra or Bhāgavatas, con-
sider him as an incarnation or part of Viṣṇu and identify
him with Ahaṅkāra, self-consciousness.--<sup>2</sup> A name of
Śiva. <sup>3</sup> The name of a celebrated Bauddha Arhat and con-
temporary of Śākyamuni. <sup>4</sup> The name of a member of the
Vṛṣṇi tribe, the descendants of Vṛṣṇi. See also {#AnirudDa#}
and {#AnirudDAyani#}. <sup>5</sup> A spy(?).
<div n="P">3. n. ({#-dDam#}) A rope for fastening cattle. E. {#a#} neg.
and {#nirudDa#}. (It is doubtful whether the meaning 1. 3. (move-
able) or the meaning 2. 4. (spy) is the correct one, the
translation being founded on the word {#cara,#} given as one
of the meanings of {#anirudDa,#} but without any further in-
dication as to the gender. From the place, however, {#cara#}
occupies in the explanation of some of the native dictio-
naries, the meaning ‘spy’ is likely to be preferable to the
meaning ‘moveable’.)
