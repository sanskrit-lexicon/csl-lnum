{#aprAptisama#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. ({#-maH-mA#}) (In the Nyāya philosophy.)
One of the two sophisms on the irrelevancy of the notion
‘cause’; viz. arguing that if a cause is stated the charac-
teristics of which cannot be proved--as by saying that
the Śyena sacrifice inflicts pain on enemies--, such charac-
teristics prevent a cause from proving the effect, i. e. from
being a valid cause; ({#‘yadi cAprAptaM liNgaM sADyabudDiM janayati#}
{#sADyABAvabudDimeva kiM tena na janayet’#}); the refutation is:
that such a cause is nevertheless valid, since it is an ideal
cause, mentioned in the Veda.--For the other sophism
on the irrelevancy of cause see {#prAptisama#}. E. {#aprApti#} and
{#sama#}. (For the gender of this word and the ellipsis required
to explain it, see the etym. of {#anityasama#}.)
