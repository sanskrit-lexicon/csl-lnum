{#apasKala#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-laH#}) (ved.) A place which is not a
threshing floor or outside of a threshing floor; a place which
is useless for the purpose of threshing or unchaffing rice
&c.; the word is used in the {%Śatapathabr.%} I. 7. 3. 26. as a
comparison to the Gārhapatya fire on which the clarified
butter is not to be fried, this fire being unfit for such a
purpose; for ‘like as grain heaped up outside of a threshing
floor is to no purpose, in the same manner clarified butter
fried in the Gārhapatya can produce no result’. E. {#apa#} and
{#sKala#}.
