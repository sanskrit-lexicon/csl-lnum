<L>5528<pc>214-b<k1>apramAdam<k2>apramAdam
{#apramAdam#}¦ Tatpur. ind. Attentively, watchfully, assiduously;
e. g. {%Vājas.:%} {#sapta fzayaH pratihitAH SarIre sapta rakzanti sada-#}
{#mapramAdam#}. [The meaning of this word would apparently
also result from the Bahuvr. {#apramAda#} taken as a neuter in
the accus., but as the latter is udātta on the last syllable,
and as {#apramAdam#} is in the Vedas udātta on the first, it
seems necessary to distinguish both forms etymologically.]
E. {#a#} neg. and {#pramAdam#} ({#mad#} with {#pra,#} kṛt aff. {#Ramul#}).
