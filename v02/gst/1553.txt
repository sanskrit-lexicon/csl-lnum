{#aTarI#}¦ f. (occurs only as a plural in the Vedas; {#-ryaH#}) The
finger. E. This word is given as an irregular derivation
from {#at#} ‘to go constantly’; but it is more probable that
it is derived, with aff. {#ari,#} from an obsolete rad. {#aT#}
which seems to have had the same meaning as {#at#} (cf.
{#aw#} and {#aW#}), but is found only in {#aTarI, aTarvan#} and their
derivatives, implying quickness or agility. The same etymo-
logical connexion between words meaning ‘finger’ and ‘fire’
may be perceived in other derivations from a radical in the
sense of ‘to go’ f. i. in {#aNguli#} or {#aNguri, agrU#} and {#agni, aNgiras,#}
from {#aNg#}. It reappears distinctly in the denom. {#aTary#} and
its derivatives {#aTarya, aTaryu#} qq. vv.
