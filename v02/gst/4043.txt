{#anDaka#}¦ 1. m. f. n. ({#-nDakaH-nDikA-nDakam#}) Blind. E. {#anDa,#} taddh. aff. {#ka#}.
<div n="P">2. m. ({#-kaH#}) A proper name of: <sup>1</sup> a demon, a son of
Kaśyapa and Diti ‘with thousand arms and heads, two
thousand eyes and feet and called Andhaka because he walked
like a blind man although he saw very well’; in his attempt
of taking a Pārijāta tree of the Swarga he was slain by
Śiva (see {#anDakaGAtin, anDakaripu#}); <sup>2</sup> a grandson of Kroṣṭṛ,
and son of Yuddhājita, who together with his brother Vṛṣṇi
is the ancestor of the celebrated family of the Andhaka-
Vṛṣṇis; <sup>3</sup> a grandson of Vṛṣṇi (the brother of Andhaka)
and son of Śvaphalka by Gāṇḍinī; <sup>4</sup> a son of Sattwat, be-
longing to the same family, by Kauśalyā; <sup>5</sup> a son of Bhīma
(of the same family) and father of Revata. [The forgoing
lineage, 2--5, is taken from the Harivanśa. In the Linga
Purāṇa an Andhaka is a son of Nahusha who, according
to other Purāṇas, is the ancestor of Kroṣṭṛ; in the Kūrma
Purāṇa an Andhaka is a son of Anśa and father of Sāttvata,
while in the Viṣṇu P. a prince of that name is mentioned
as the son of Sāttvata who is apparently the same as the
Sattwat of the Hariv.] <sup>6</sup> The name of a Muni (in the Padma-
purāṇa).
<div n="P">3. m. plur. ({#-kAH#}) The descendants of Andhaka (2. 2),
(usually mentioned together with the Vṛṣṇis; see {#anDaka-#}
{#vfzRi#}), apparently the ancient inhabitants of Berar.
<div n="P">4. f. ({#-nDikA#}) <sup>1</sup> Night. <sup>2</sup> A kind of play or gambling.
<sup>3</sup> A disease of the penis (? the same as {#sarzapI#} q. v.). <sup>4</sup> A
diseased eye. <sup>5</sup> A woman. [The two latter meanings from
the Śabdaratnāvalī, where the word is thus explained: {#anDikA#}
{#rajanI nArI dyUtaBede'kzRi dUzite#}.] E. {#anDa,#} taddh. aff. {#kan#}.
