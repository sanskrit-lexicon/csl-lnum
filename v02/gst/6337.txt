{#aBivAdana#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-nam#}) Respectful salutation of a superior
or elder, especially of a Guru, by a junior or inferior for the
sake of obtaining his blessing; ({%Vīramitr. Āchāraprak.:%} {#a-#}
{#BivAdananAma vaworAtmAnamaBi gurorASIrvacanAnukUlo vyApA-#}
{#raH#}). It consists of three acts, viz. 1. the {#pratyutTAna#} or rising
from the seat, 2. the {#upasaMgrahaRa#} or {#pAdopasaMgrahaRa,#} the peculiar
[Page264-b+ 56]
mode of Hindu obeisance, and 3. the {#aBivAda#} or the ut-
tering of the formula of salutation.
<div n="P"><sup>a.</sup> The first act is indispensable on the part of the person
whose duty it is to make the salutation, whatever be the
quality of the person saluted ({%Āpastamba:%} {#sarvatra tu pratyutTA-#}
{#yABivAdanam#}); but the two other acts undergo various
modifications according to the rank or quality of the person
saluted and the person saluting.
<div n="P"><sup>b.</sup> With regard to the {#upasaMgrahaRa#} or the obeisance, the
general rule is, according to {%Manu,%} that the saluter should
with crossed hands ({%comm.:%} the right hand being placed
over the left) clasp the feet of his {%Guru,%} touching the left
foot with his left, and the right foot with his right, hand;
({%Manu:%} {#vyastapARinA kAryamupasaMgrahaRaM guroH . savyena savyaH#}
{#sprazwavyo dakziRena ca dakziRaH#}); the same injunction is given
by {%Āśvalāyana%} and {%Baudhāyana%} with the addition that he
should first touch, with composure of mind, his own left
ear with his left and his right ear with his right, hand,
and then make his bow, in the indicated manner, by
touching his Guru from the knees to the feet; ({%Āśvalāy.:%}

{#Srotre saMspfSya manaH samADAyADastAjjAnvorA padByAmityupasaMgra-#}
{#haRam#}); according to some, his hands must be made
hollow, when he touches the feet of the Guru and he
is forbidden, under the threat of loosing the benefit of all
his pious actions, to perform this act only with one hand
({%Paīṭhīnasi:%} {#uttAnAByAM pARiByAM dakziRena dakziRaM savyena savyaM#}

{#ciccetasA DarmamAcaret . sarvaM tannizPalaM yAti ekahastABivA-#}
{#danAt#}); {%Āpastamba%} enjoins, on his part, that a Brāhmaṇa
when saluting should raise his right arm as far as his ears,
a Kshatriya as far as his breast (or according to a v. 1. as
far as his shoulder), a Vaiśya as far as his navel and that
a Sūdra making his obeisance should hold it down ({%Āpast.:%}
{#svaM dakziRaM bAhuM SrotrasamaM prasArya brAhmaRo'BivAdayetoraHsamaM#}
{#rAjanyo maDyasamaM vESyo nIcEH SUdraH prAYjaliH;#} {%Vīram.%} on the
latter: {#aMsasamaM rAjanya ityapi pAWaH . maDyaM nABiH;#} {%Atri,%} how-
ever, seems to reserve this mode of salutation for a learned
Brāhmaṇa in general, while he enjoins the touching of the
feet, if the person saluted is a Guru; {#dakziRaM pARimudDftya#}
{#prakAmamaBivAdayet . Srotriye tvaYjaliH kAryaH pAdopagrahaRaM gu-#}
{#roriti#}). If the person to be saluted is a woman, the
politeness of touching her from the knees to the feet is sub-
ject to some restrictions: if she is the wife of the {%Guru,%}
but not of the same class as her husband, {%Manu%} and other
legislators dispense with it altogether; if she is of the same
class and the student is young, he must pay her that re-
spect only when he returns from a journey, on other oc-
casions he prostrates himself before her at his daily salu-
tation, ({%Vīram.%} on {%Manu%} 2. 217. and {%Gautama:%} {#viprozyeti va-#}
{#canAnna pratyahamiti gamyate#}); but if she is young and the young
man knows already to distinguish right from wrong which
[Page265-a+ 56]
is the case when he has completed his twentieth year (ac-
cording to {%Manu;%} or his sixteenth year, according to the
{%Vīram.%} on {%Gautama%}) he must never touch her feet but al-
ways prostrate himself before her; {%Manu%} enjoins further
that the sister of his mother, the wife of his maternal
uncle, his own wife's mother and the sister of his father
must be treated by him like the wife of his Guru, equally
so the wife of his brother ({%comm.:%} the eldest wife, of the
same class), and that the sister of his father and of his
mother as well as his own elder sister must be saluted in
the same manner as his mother, but that his paternal and
maternal kinswomen are to be greeted by touching their
feet only on his return from a journey. {%Gautama'%}s rule
that the wives of a brother and one's own wife's mother
are never to be touched in this manner is restricted by the
{%Vīramitrodaya%} to the wives of the same class ({%Gaut.:%} {#nopa-#}
{#saMgrahaRaM BrAtfBAryARAM SvaSrvASca;#} {%Viram.:%} {#yannopa°° iti gOta-#}
{#mavAkyaM tadasavarRAvizayam#}), and when the same legislator
enjoins that with the exception of a mother, the wife of a
paternal uncle and a sister, no woman must be touched
by her feet in being greeted except on the return from a
journey, the same commentator infers that this ceremony
is obligatory on the latter occasion ({%Gautama:%} {#nAviprozya#}
{#strIRAmamAtfpitfvyaBAryABAginInAm;#} {%Vīram.:%} {#aviprozyeti#}
{#vacanAdviprozya tu pAdopasaMgrahaRaM kartavyameva#}).
<div n="P"><sup>c.</sup> The formula of salutation consists in general, if the
person greeted is a man, of the word {#aBivAdaye#} ‘I greet’,
followed by the declaration of the saluter's own name and
ending with the reverential word {#BoH#} ({%Manu:%} {#aBivAdAtparaM#}
{#vipro jyAyAMsamaBivAdayan . asO nAmAhamasmIti svaM nAma#}
{#parikIrtayet .…BoHSabdaM kIrtayedante svasya nAmno'Bi-#}
{#vAdane . nAmnAM svarUpaBAvo hi BoBAva fziBiH smftaH#}); e. g.
{#aBivAdaye devadatto'haM BoH,#} or {#aBivAdaya indravarmAhaM BoH,#}
or {#aBivAdaya indrapAlito'haM BoH,#} or (if a woman greets) e. g.
{#aBivAdaye gArgyahaM BoH;#} according to the {%Vīram.,%} some com-
bine with the declaration of the name also that of the family
and the descendants when the word {#aBivAdaye#} is placed
at the end of the salutation, e. g. {#amukapravaro'mukagotro'muka-#}
{#SarmAhaM Bo BivAdaye#} ‘father of such and such a son, descendant
of such and such a family, I, such and such a…sarman,
(e. g. {#kfzRaSarman#}) Sir, greet (thee)’; if husband and wife salute
there is no other restriction ({%Gaut.:%} {#strIpuMyoge'BivAdato#}
{#'niyamameke#}), but the formula becomes shortened in this way:
{#aBivAdaye gArgyahaM gArgaSarmAhaM BoH#}. If the person saluted is a
woman or a Śūdra or a man who either does not understand
the Sanskṛt meaning of the proper name or does not know
the proper manner of protracting the final vowel of the
name in the return of the salutation or is otherwise igno-
rant of the proper manner of returning it (see g.), the formula
of the saluter is simply thus: {#‘aBivAdaye'ham’#} ‘I greet’,
such an address being not considered an {#aBivAdana;#} ({%Vī-%}

ferring to the Śūtra and Vārttikas of {%Pāṇini%} VIII. 2. 83.).
[{%Medhātithi%} and {%Govindarāja%} take the word {#nAma#} in the
passage of Manu quoted above in its literal sense and give
the formula; e. g. {%Medhāt.:%} {#aBivAdaye devadattanAmAhaM BoH,#}
but this mode of salutation is not approved of by other
authorities; e. g. {%Kullūka%} in reference to this use of {#nAman:#}
{#meDAtiTigovindarAjayoraBiDAnamapramARam#}.]
<div n="P"><sup>d.</sup> The general rule that prevails at a salutation is that
the person who receives it must be an ‘elder’ or what is
technically termed a {%Guru%} and that the person who pays
it must be a ‘youth’ or an inferior; such a salutation
may be of course occasional, but it is a duty of a youth
to salute his ‘elders’ or ‘Gurus’ every morning after
he has managed the consecrated fire ({%Yājnav.:%} {#agnikAryaM#}
{#tataH kuryAtsaMDyayoruBayorapi .. tato'BivAdayedvfdDAnasAvahami-#}
{#ti bruvan;#} {%Yama:%} {#tato'BivAdayedvfdDAnagnikAryAdanantaram;#}
{%Gautama:%} {#guroH pAdopasaMgrahaRaM prAtaH#}).--For the persons
comprised under the name {#guru#} and their relative superiority
or inferiority see s. v., it may suffice here to give the de-
finition of {%Devala%} who enumerates as male Gurus: the
teacher (see {#upADyAya#}), the father, the eldest brother, the
king, the maternal and paternal uncle, the father-in-law,
an initiated householder, the maternal and paternal grand-
father, and the eldest of the same class; as female Gurus:
the mother, the maternal and paternal grandmother, the
sisters of father and mother, the mother-in-law, and the
old nurse; and to add from the definition of others the
priest (see {#ftvij#}) and the spiritual teacher (see {#AcArya#}).
If there are several persons present who have a claim to a
salutation, the teacher who has given instruction either on
worldly or ritual or spiritual matters, has precedence be-
fore all others, according to {%Manu%} ({#lOkikaM vEdikaM cApi#}
{#taTADyAtmikameva ca . AdadIta yato jYAnaM taM pUrvamaBivAdayet#}),
and, in general, every superior Guru has precedence before
the one next to him in degree. [In the passage of {%Gautama:%}
{#pAdopasaMgrahaRaM gurusamavAye'nvaham . aBigamya tu viprozya mA-#}
{#tfpitftadbanDUnAM#} (i. e. mother, father, maternal uncle and aunt,
paternal uncle and aunt &c.) {#pUrvajAnAM#} (i. e. elder brothers
&c.) {#vidyAgurURAM#} (i. e. the Upādhyāya, Āchārya &c.) {#tatta-#}
{#dgurURAM ca#} (i. e. their maternal or paternal grandfathers &c.)
{#saMnipAte parasya,#} the last word ({#parasya#}) does not imply that
each {%following%} precedes in rank each preceding, but means
each {%superior; Vīram.:%} {#mAtrAdInAM purA yatsaMnipAte samAgame#}
{#parasyotkfzwasya praTamamupasaMgrahaRaM kartavyam#}.] The term ‘youth’
mentioned above is not to be taken in its literal, but in its
metaphorical sense; for {%Manu%} rules that fellow citizens are
equal (as to age) for ten years, dancers and singers for five,
learned theologians for three, but persons related by blood
for a very short time; again, that one must consider a
Brāhmaṇa though but ten years old, as if he were the father
of a Kshatriya though aged a hundred years; therefore a
friend, e. g., is not to be addressed with the words {#BoH#} or
{#Bavat,#} unless he be older than ten years, and a Brāhmaṇa
must never salute first a Kshatriya or a man of a lower
class, however distinguished he be ({%Vīram.:%} {#daSavarzADikakaH#}

{#tAH#}); for if he does so, he incurs severe spiritual penalties.
<div n="P"><sup>e.</sup> Persons not to be saluted are, according to {%Manu, Gau-%}
{%tama, Baudhāyana:%} a priest ({%Ṛtvij%}), a wife's father, a maternal
and paternal uncle, learned and pious persons, {%if they are%}
{%younger;%} they are merely to be addressed with the words ‘I, so
and so, am here’ {#asAvaham,#} and to be honoured by rising from
the seat; this ceremony does not constitute, therefore, an
{#aBivAdana#}. [In {%Manu%} 2. 130. the word {#gurUn#} is to be taken
in the sense of ‘an elder by learning and piousness’; it
does not occur in the corresponding passages of {%Gautama%}
and {%Baudh.;%} the former: {#ftvikSvaSurapitfvyamAtulAnAM tu ya-#}
{#vIyasAM pratyutTAnamanaBivAdyAH;#} the latter with the same words
except for the last, {#pratyutTAyABiBAzaRam#}.] In law courts, in
houses of penance and palaces where Brāhmaṇas are assem-
bled, the latter are not to be saluted individually, but the words
{#sarveByo namaH#} ‘respect to all’ are to be addressed to the whole
assembly; this mode of address is called the {#namaskAra#} which
is different therefore from the {#aBivAdana;#} ({%Viṣṇu:%} {#saBAsu#}

{#zaH . kiM tu sarveByo nama ityeva vaktavyam;#} {%Vṛhadviṣṇu:%} {#saBAM#}
{#nABivAdayet#}); {%Āpastamba%} forbids to salute a man who
carries fuel, flowers, kuśa grass, fire, water and rice in
his hands and one who performs the Japahoma; {%Kātyāyana:%}
a wicked man, a cripple, a stranger, one who has enemies
after him, a diseased person, a Yogin, one bent upon do-
ing penance and a youngster (similarly {%Vṛhaspati%}); {%Śatā-%}
{%tapa:%} a heretic, an outcaste ({#patita#}), a Vrātya (q. v.), a
person while his head is oiled, while eating, yawning,
cleansing his teeth, performing his natural functions &c.;
the {%Vṛhadnāradīya:%} an atheist, a libertine ({#BinnamaryAda#}), an
impious man, a thief and a cheat, a man fond of litigation,
a drunken man, one who vomits or stands in water, one
who carries rice given to him as alms or one who is in a
lying position, one who performs a Śrāddha, a vow or a
sacrifice; amongst {%women Śātātapa%} forbids to greet: one in
her courses, one recently delivered, one who has killed her
husband and one who has miscarried.
<div n="P"><sup>f.</sup> A man must not salute, according to {%Āpastamba,%} while
he has his shoes on, while his head is covered ({#vezwitaSi-#}
{#rAH#}) and while his hands are stretched out; according to
{%Śaṅkha,%} while he carries water in his hands, while he is
unclean, performs funeral rites or is in a lying position
…, according to {%Baudhāyana,%} while he carries fuel, a
water-jug, flowers or rice.
<div n="P"><sup>g.</sup> The return of the salutation or the {#pratyaBivAdana#} con-
sists, generally, in uttering first the words {#AyuzmAnBava#}
{#sOmya#} ‘long mayst thou live, friend’ or similar words to
the same effect; ({%Manu:%} {#AyuzmAnBava sOmyeti vAcyo vipro#}
{#'BivAdane,#} where the word {#iti#} indicates, according to {%Me-%}
{%dhātithi%} and the {%Vīramitrodaya,%} that the preceding words are
merely an illustration of the phrase to be used; thus the
address may be worded also in this manner: {#AyuzmAneDi#} or
{#dIrGAyurBUyAH#} or {#ciraM jIva#} &c.); these words are followed
[Page266-b+ 56]
by the name of the person who has greeted first and, if
the latter is a Brāhmaṇa, the last vowel of his name, which
at the same time is the last vowel of the whole phrase, be-
comes protracted (according to the general rules on making
vowels {#pluta#} q. v.); some require moreover, that the name
should always receive the addition of the word {#Sarman,#} others,
however, consider this addition unnecessary ({%Manu:%} {#akA-#}
{#raScAsya nAmno'nte vAcyaH pUrvAkzaraH plutaH;#} {%Vīram.:%} {#tatra nAmE-#}
{#veti kecit . SarmAntamityapare#}); the return of the salute to
a Brāhmaṇa would therefore run on the following pattern:
{#AyuzmAnBava sOmya devadattA3,#} or {#AyuzmAnBava sOmya devada-#}
{#ttaSarmA 3 n,#} or {#AyuzmAnBava piRAkapARA 3 i (= piRAka-#}
{#pARe),#} or {#…vizRA 3 u (= vizRo),#} or {#AyuzmAneDi#}
{#…#} &c.; (the omission of the word {#Sarman#} when it originally
belongs to the name, or the omission of the name altogether
are rebuked by {%Kullūka%}). If the person thus addressed is
a Kshatriya or Vaiśya or if the word {#BoH#} is added after
the name (which seems permitted according to {%Kātyāyana%}
on {%Pāṇ.%} VIII. 2. 83., although {%Patanjali%} observes that other
authorities do not approve of the combination of the name
{%and%} {#BoH,#} but allow only the enunciation of the one or the
other), the protraction of the vowel is optional; e. g. in
returning the salute to a Kshatriya: {#AyuzmAneDIndravarmA 3 n#}
or {#…°varman,#} to a Vaiśya: {#AyuzmAneDIndrapAlitA 3#} or
{#…°pAlita;#} or with {#BoH, AyuzmAneDi devadatta BoH 3#} or
{#…BoH#} (but the latter phrase should be, according to the
above mentioned observation, either {#AyuzmAneDi BoH 3#} or
{#…devadattA 3#}); if the person addressed is a woman or a
Śūdra or spoken to in contempt or derision, no protraction
of the vowel takes place, e. g. a woman: {#AyuzmatI Bava#}
{#gArgi;#} a Śūdra: {#AyuzmAneDi tuzajaka;#} or in contempt: {#A-#}
{#yuzmAneDi sTAlin#} ({%Patanjali:%} {#asUyakastvamasi jAlma . na tvaM#}

{#rvacanaM hi pratyaBivAdo gfhyate . pratisaMBAzaRamAtraM tu pratyaBivAdaM#}
{#matvA vArttikakftAsUyake pratizeDa uktaH;#} in phrases such as
{#devadatta kuSalyasi, devadatta AyuzmAneDi#} which are not word-
ed in the proper manner in which the return of a salutation
should be made, since the name does not stand at the end
of the sentence, the protraction of the vowel is equally
prohibited).--If the person to whom the salutation is to
be returned, has performed the preparatory observances of
a sacrifice, his name should not be enounced but in its
place the reverential word {#BoH;#} and to the wife of another
or to any woman not related by blood the epithet of address
should be {#Bavati#} or {#suBage#} or {#Bagini#} (according to {%Manu%}).
After the person has returned the greeting, he may put
the usual polite questions, after the saluter's health &c.;
(it is not therefore the latter who asks after the health &c.
of the person who returns the salute, for {%Govindarāja%} who
expresses that opinion, is rebuked for it by {%Kullūka%}); the
model, however, laid down by {%Manu%} and {%Āpastamba,%} that
a Brāhmaṇa must be asked whether he prospers, a Ksha-
[Page267-a+ 56]
triya whether he is quite well, a Vaiśya whether he is
happy, and a Śūdra whether he is free from disease ({%Manu:%}
{#brAhmaRaM kuSalaM pfcCetkzatrabanDumanAmayam . vESyaM kzemaM samAgamya#}

{#vA vipraM pfcCet . anAmayaM kzatriyaM kzemaM vESyamArogyaM SUdram#})
is not to be taken in its literal sense, as the commentators
observe and as may be inferred from instances in the epic
and dramatic literature; thus in the {%Sabhāparvan%} of the {%Ma-%}
{%hābhārata, Nārada%} after having returned the salute of {%Yu-%}
{%dhishthira%} does not content himself with the question whether
the king is quite well, but overwhelms him with an inter-
rogatory of 110 Slokas (v. 151-260) which is perhaps the
completest of its kind, though probably an overdone illus-
tration of this part of a Hindu greeting.

{#SizyARAmASizaM dadyAtpAdopagrahaRo guruH#} and compare the
