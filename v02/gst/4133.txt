{#annamala#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-lam#}) <sup>1</sup> Offal, sweepings. <sup>2</sup> The worst
kind of spirituous liquor, viz. {#surA#}. [The latter meaning
requires an explanation: Manu 11. 93 says: {#surA vE mala-#}
{#mannAnAM#} &c. and forbids the drinking of the spirituous liquor
{#surA#} to a man of the three first castes; Kullūka in his com-
ment seems to take {#malamannAnAM#} or {#annamala#} in the general sense
of ‘extract of rice’, because {#surA#} is made from the flower of
rice ({#taRqulapizwasADyatvAtsurA annamalam#}); but Pulastya, as
quoted by Vijnāneśvara in the Mitākṣara names twelve
sorts of intoxicating drinks, stating that {#surA#} is the very
worst description amongst them: {#pAnasaM drAkzaM mADUkaM KArjUraM#}
{#tAlamEkzavam . maDUtTaM sEramArizwamEreyaM nArikelajam . samA-#}
{#nAni vijAnIyAnmadyAnyekAdaSEva tu . dvAdaSaM tu surAmadyaM sarve-#}
{#zAmaDamaM smftam;#} and Vijnāneśvara in commenting upon the
quoted passage of Manu and adducing Pāṇ. II. 1. 34. where
the word {#anna#} means a preparation of rice &c. observes
that it is intended to convey in this passage the sense of
spirituous liquor, the latter being also an {#annavikAra#} or
preparation of rice, and {#surA#} being used also in the Sautrā-
maṇī libations in the sense of spirituous liquor made of rice:
{#‘surA vE malamannAnAM pApmA ca malamucyata iti . annavikAra-#}

For this meaning of {#anna#} compare also {#annapeya#}.] E. {#anna#}
and {#mala#}.
