{#anaquh#}¦ Tatpur. m. (sing. {#-qvAn, -qvan, -qvAham, -quhA, -quhe,#}
{#-quhaH, -quhi;#} du. {#-qvAhO, -qudByAm, -quhoH;#} plur. {#-qvAhaH,#}
{#-quhaH, -qudBiH, -qudByaH, -qutsu#}) f. ({#-quhI#} or {#-qvAhI#}) <sup>1</sup> A bull
or ox, especially one fit to draw a cart or to bear a weight.
<sup>2</sup> The sign of the zodiac, Taurus. <sup>3</sup> (According to a vaidik
commentator also used in the adjective sense:) fit or able
to draw a cart, as an epithet of a goat; but this expla-
nation seems doubtful.--(The use of the femin. {#anaqvAhI#}
would be restricted, according to one authority, to the
Vedas, while others do not make any distinction between
this form and {#anaquhI#}. In Avyayībh. compounds, the com-
pound terminating with {#anaquh#} assumes the samāsānta aff.
{#wac#} (see {#anaquha#}) and in Bahuvr. compounds, the samā-
sānta aff. {#kap#} (see {#anaqutka#}); in the latter, however, it
[Page066-b+ 56]
may also retain its original form, with the following de-
clension in the neuter: sing. {#anaqut,#} du. {#anaquhI#} and plur.
{#anaqvAMhi#}.) E. {#anas,#} with {#s#} changed to {#q,#} and {#vah#} (from
{#vah,#} kṛt aff. {#kvip#}) with samprasāraṇa of {#v;#} in the fem.
with aff. {#NIz#}.
