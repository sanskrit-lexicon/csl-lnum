{#anyatA#}¦ f. ({#-tA#}) The being other, otherness, difference; also
{#anyatva#} q. v.; e. g. {#jAtilakzaRadeSEranyatAnavacCedAttulyayostataH#}
{#pratipattiH#} (Difference) is understood through it (viz. through
profound meditation), since it is impossible to remove the
otherness which exists between two (apparently) like objects
either with regard to species or characteristic properties or
space; (as in the case, for instance of various atoms, or
of Īśvara and the Yogin). E. {#anya,#} taddh. aff. {#tal#}.
