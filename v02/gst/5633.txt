{#aprAyu#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-yuH-yuH-yu#}) (ved.) Attentive, assiduous;
(according to {%Yāska:%} {#aprAyuvaH = apramAdyantaH,#} {%Mahīdhara:%}
= {#anAlasAH;#} but {%Sāyaṇa%} gives to this word in one verse
the meaning: not going forth, not leaving: = {#apragacCantaH;#}
while in another he admits also of the former meaning,
which seems more congenial with the context). E. {#a#} neg.
and {#prAyu#}.
