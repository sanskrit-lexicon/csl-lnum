{#aByastamita#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-taH-tA-tam#}) One towards whom
the sun has set (scil. while he is asleep), asleep at sunset;
e. g. {%Gotama:%} {#sUryAByudito brahmacArI tizWedaharaBuYjano'Bya-#}
{#stamitaSca rAtriM japansAvitrIm#} (where the ellipsis ‘when
asleep’ follows from the word {#svapna#} in the preceeding pas-
sage: {#retaskandane Baye roge svapne'gnInDanaBEkzacaraRAni sapta-#}
{#rAtraM kftvAjyahomaH sABisanDervA retasyAByAm#}).--This is the
reading acc. to both Calc. edd. of {%Kullūka%} to {%Manu%} 2. 220;
the Calc. ed. of {%Gotama'%}s {%Sanh.%} (made by {%Bhavanīcharana-%}
{%vandya,%} as he says, {#bahuprayatnataH#}) has, however, {#sUryAByudite#}
{#…(a)Byastamite ca…,#} when it would be necessary to
take {#sU°#} as equivalent to {#sUryAByudaya#} and {#aBya°#} as expressing
the sense of {#aByastamaya,#} both words being then locatives
of a neuter {#°tam#}. But {%Kullūka'%}s reading seems better as
being countenanced by analogous expressions in {%Manu%} 2. 221.
Comp. {#aBinirmukta#} and {#aByudita#}. E. {#aBi#} and {#astamita#} (not
{#aByastam#} and {#ita,#} for {#aBi#} refers to the person or act con-
cerned by the sunset; similarly in ved. passages which
contain the combination {#aByastamagAt#} or {#aByastamiyAt,#} the
rad. {#gA#} or {#i#} are combined first with {#astam#} and then with
{#aBi,#} not with {#aByastam#}); see also the preceding.
