{#apehikawA#}Â¦ Bahuvr. f. ({#-wA#}) ? The correctness of the word
seems doubtful; it ought to be perhaps {#apehikarawA,#} i. e. a
festival or ceremony where low people are denied admis-
sion. See the explanation s. v. {#apehivARijA#}. E. {#apehi#}
(imper. of {#i#} with {#apa#}) and {#kawa#} (or perhaps {#karawa#}), scil. {#kriyA#}.
