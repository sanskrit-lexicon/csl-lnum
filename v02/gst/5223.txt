{#aputrikA#}¦ I. Tatpur. f. ({#-kA#}) A daughter who is not {#putrikA#}
i. e. who is not appointed by her father, on failure of a
son, to raise up male issue for him, for the purpose of
performing his obsequies; e. g. {#putrikOrasayoH samo DanA-#}
{#DikAraH . aputrikAyAstUQAyAH putrAdinyUnopakArakasvaputradvA-#}
{#reRopakArakatvam#}. (Not to be confounded with the Bahuvr.
{#aputrikA,#} fem. of {#aputraka#} q. v.) E. {#a#} neg. and {#putrikA#}.
<div n="P">II. Bahuvr. m. ({#-kaH#}) A father who has left no daughter
appointed by him to be a {#putrikA#} q. v.--{%Jīmūtavāhana%} ex-
plains in a verse of {%Devala%} which treats of the succession
of daughters when the father leaves no widow: {#kanyAByaSca#}
{#piturdravyAddeyaM vEvAhikaM vasu . aputrikasya kanyA svA DarmajA#}
{#putravadBavet,#} the word {#putrikA#} as {%implying%} the meaning ‘son’:
{#putrikApadaM putropalakzaRam#} when the verse would have to be
rendered: ‘to unmarried daughters a nuptial portion must
be given out of the estate of the father; of a father who
has no {#putrikA#} in the place of a son, his own daughter (i. e.
one of the same caste) lawfully begotten must be considered
like a son (i. e. be entitled to the inheritance); the same
sense is conveyed by {%Parāśara'%}s words: {#aputrasya mftasya ku-#}
{#mArI rikTaM gfhlIyAt#} ({%Dāyabh.%} p. 271, {%Dāyakramas.%} p. 4,
{%Vīramitrod.%} p. 204 a. with the v. 1. {#aputramftasya#}), and by the
quotation of the {%Dāyakramas.%} p. 4: {#aputrasya ca svA kanyA#}
{#DarmajA putravadDaret#} (which seems to have been the reading
of {%Colebrooke%} when he translates in his Digest vol. III. p. 491.
CCCCXX: ‘and his own daughter…shall {%take%} &c.’. But
the more precise bearing of {%Devala'%}s clause is conveyed by
a verse of {%Vṛhaspati%} which is to the same effect, viz. {#sa-#}
{#dfSI sadfSenoQA sADvI SuSrUzaRe ratA . kftAkftA vAputrasya#}
{#piturDanaharI tu sA#} ({%Dāyabh.%} p. 273, {%Dāyakramas.%} p. 4, {%Vīra-%}
[Page196-b+ 56]
{%mitr.%} p. 204{%b, Colebr. Dig.%} III. p. 186. CCXXIV. 2.); for he in-
troduces there the terms {#kftA#} and {#akftA#} which apply only
to a {#putrikA#} either appointed by a plain declaration or by
an implied intention ({%Manu%} 9. 136., {%Dig.%} III. 164. CCVII) and
the author of the {%Smṛtichandrikā%} (accord. to the {%Vīramitrod.%}
p. 205 {%a%}) infers from this verse that the {#putrikA,#} whether
{#kftA#} or {#akftA,#} precedes in succession the wife of the de-
ceased, who herself precedes the daughter qualified by the four
epithets {#sadfSI…ratA,#} viz. {#sadfSI sadfSenoQeti prAkpaWitaM#}
{#vfhaspativacanaM smfticandrikAkAra itTaM vyAcaKyO . atrAdyAni#}
{#catvAri viSezaRAni patnyA UrDvamarTagrAhiRIduhitfvizayARi .#}
{#tataH prAgDanagrAhiRIduhitfviSezaRe dve avaSizwe . kftAkftA ve-#}
{#tyatra putriketi viSezyADyAhAraH . itaratra duhiteti viSezyA-#}
{#DyAhAraH . vASabdaSca vyavasTitavikalpArTaH . evaM cAyamarTaH .#}
{#OrasaputravihInasya piturDanaM dviviDApi putrikA patnyAH pUrvaM#}
{#gfhlIyAt . savarRAdiviSezaRopetA tu duhitA tata UrDvamiti#}.
Now as the regular line of succession is in the first rank
a son, then on failure of him the widow, and on failure
of her the daughter &c. (comp. {%Dig.%} III. p. 489. CCCCXVII)
and as a {#putrikA#} is equal in right to a son ({%Kullūka%} on
{%Manu%} 9. 130. and comp. 9. 127.), the word {#aputrikasya#} of {%De-%}
{%vala,%} it is true, coincides in legal value with the word {#a-#}
{#putrasya#} of {%Parāśara%} &c., but on the other hand it is clear
that the former is a more precise expression than the latter,
since an {#aputrika#} will always be an {#aputra,#} but an {#aputra#}
may not be an {#aputrika#}. (The Pandit who has supplied the
notes to Colebrooke's Digest denies the necessity of the
former part of this inference (vol. III. p. 188), for a father
may, in his opinion, appoint his daughter even if he has a
son, yet his argument is not founded on the law-authorities,
but on a precedent mentioned in the {%Bhāgav. Pur.%} (4. 1. 2.)
where Manu appoints his daughter Ākūti as {#putrikA,#} when
giving her in marriage to Ruchi, although she had brothers.)
{%Jīmūtavāhana'%}s gloss is therefore not to be rendered ‘{#putrikA#}
{%means%}’, but ‘{#putrikA#} {%implies%} the meaning son’, when the
concordance between the quoted authorities becomes com-
plete. As {%Colebrooke%} has probably translated the reading
{#aputrasya ca svA kanyA#} &c., mentioned before, he has no re-
mark on the difficulty conveyed by the reading {#aputrikasya#}
(but comp. vol. III. p. 493. 1. 38 ff.).--[A conjecture has
been proposed to read {#aputrakasya#} instead of the latter
word; but as it is advanced without any argument what-
ever, and is in the teeth of {%Jīmūtavāhana'%}s gloss which is
misunderstood in rendering {#aputrika#} ‘sonless’, it seems
merely to proceed from a gratuitous trifling with the text.]
E. {#a#} priv. and {#putrikA#}.
