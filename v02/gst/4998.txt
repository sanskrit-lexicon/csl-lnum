{#apaspfc#}¦ (?) Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-k-k-k#}) (ved.) (Perhaps.) Yield-
ing, giving; in the {%Ātharvav.%} 13. 1. 27: {#vi mimIzvava payasva-#}
{#tIM GftAcIM devAnAM DenuranapaspfgezA#} ‘make her to have milk
and to become possessed of butter for the gods: this cow
does not yield any’. E. {#spfc (= pfc)#} with {#apa,#} or {#pfc#}
with {#apa,#} āgāma {#suw,#} kṛt aff. {#kvip#}. [This interpretation
is hypothetical, in want of a comm. to the Atharv. The
same meaning might result in deriving {#apaspfk#} from {#apaspfS#}
‘sprinkling, shedding’, the radicals {#pfc#} and {#spfS#} being
connected in origin; but the former seems more natural.]
