{#apIvyadarSana#}¦ Bahuvr. m. f. n. ({#-naH-nA-nam#}) Of very beautiful
appearance. In the two verses of the {%Bhāgav. Purāna%} (1.
12. 8.): {#dadarSa puruzaM…. aNguzWamAtramamalaM sPuratpurawamOli-#}
{#nam . apIvyadarSanaM SyAmaM taqidvAsasamacyutam#} (comm. {#apI°#}
{#= atisundaraM dfSyata iti darSanaM rUpaM yasya tam#}), and (3.
28. 17.) {#apIvyadarSanaM SaSvatsarvalokanamaskftam#} &c. (epithets of
Viṣṇu; comm. {#apI° = atisundaraM BaktivizayaM darSanaM yasya#}),
the Bombay edition reads in the text as well as in the
[Page195-b+ 56]
comm. {#apIcyadarSanaM;#} but the scrupulous care which distin-
guishes {%Bournouf'%}s edition of this Purāṇa leaves no doubt
that his reading {#apIvya°#} has been adopted on account of
better evidence; it is supported, too, by the quotation of
the latter verse, in the valuable dictionary of {%Rādhākānta-%}
{%deva.%} E. {#apIvya#} and {#darSana#}.
