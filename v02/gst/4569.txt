eases of the vital air (see {#vAtavyADi#}), viz. a peculiar kind of
spasmodic contraction of the body (tetanus?); described in the
following manner: ‘if the vital air is deranged and rises from
its situation, it produces pain in the chest, head and temples,
convulses and bends the body; the patient is motionless,
his eyes shut and fixed, he moans, he does not breathe or
breathes with difficulty and has no consciousness; he feels
well when the chest becomes free, otherwise he faints away’.
