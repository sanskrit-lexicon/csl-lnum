{#aBicAra#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-raH#}) Incantation, employment of charms
or spells for a malevolent purpose.--The {%Shaḍvinśa-Brā-%}
{%hmaṇa%} names as such purposes: killing an enemy and de-
priving him of his cattle or property; it gives an account
of four sacrifices which are performed for the attainment
of these objects, (see {#Syena, trivfdagnizwoma, saMdaMSa#} and {#vajra#})
and describes the manner in which the mantras are to be
recited at these sacrifices; (see {#vizwuti#}).--The {%Tantrasāra%}
(as quoted by {%Rādhākāntad.%}) names six purposes of incan-
tation, viz. causing death ({#mAraRa#}), mental aberration ({#mo-#}
{#hana#}), stoppage of the bodily functions ({#stamBana#}), hatred ({#vi-#}
{#dvezaRa#}), ruin ({#uccAwana#}) and submission ({#vaSIkaraRa#}). [Comp.
e. g. also the following passage from the {%Skanda-Purāṇa:%}

speaks of a variety of fever caused by incantation (see {#a-#}
{#BicArajvara#} and comp. {#aBizaNgajvara#}), the symptoms of
which are, according to the {%Nighaṇṭa Prakāśa,%} thirst,
mental aberration, abscesses, delirium, fainting, anguish,
excessive heat &c.--{%Manu%} (likewise Viṣṇu &c.) when
speaking of incantations (9. 290.) makes a distinction between
{#aBicAra, mUlakarman#} and various {#kftyA;#} the former com-
prises, according to {%Medhātithi%} and {%Kullūka%} as well incan-
tations founded on vaidik writings ({#vEdika#} or {#SAstrIya,#}
such as the Śyena &c.), as those founded on vulgar super-
stition ({#lOkika,#} such as taking the dust of the feet, digging
in needles--{#sUcIniKanana#} in the E. I. H. Mss. of {%Medh.%} being
apparently a better reading than {#mUlaniKanana#} in the present edd.
of {%Kull.%}--&c.) for the purpose of {%causing death;%} {#mUlakarman#} is,
according to both comm., {%subduing%} a person by means of
mantras, drugs &c. ({%Kull.:%} {#mantrOzaDAdinA;#} {%Medh.:%} {#mantrA-#}
{#dikriyayA#}); the {#kftyA#} are, according to {%Kullūka,%} incantations
for the sake of {%causing ruin, making sick%} &c., according to
{%Medh.,%} for the sake of {%causing ruin, animosity between friends%}
{%or relatives, working wonders%} &c. ({#uccAwanasuhfdbanDukalahavici-#}
{#trIkaraRAdihetavaH#}).--{%Manu%} fines a person who employs
charms two hundred Paṇas (9. 290.), classes in another pas-
sage {#aBicAra#} and {#mUlakarman#} amongst the Upapātaka (11. 63.)
and makes the expiation of an {#aBicAra#} depend on the per-
formance, thrice repeated, of the penance called Kṛchchhra
(11. 197.). But as these clauses would jar apparently with
the vaidik texts which impliedly sanction the employment
of charms by regulating the sacrifices Śyena &c. performed
for incantatory purposes, {%Kullūka%} qualifies the definition of
Manu 11. 63. by commenting that {#aBicAra#} is an {#upapAtaka,#} if
it causes the death of an {%innocent%} or {%unoffending%} person ({#SyenA-#}
{#diyajYenAnaparADasya mAraRam#}), while {%Medhātithi%} seems merely
[Page240-b+ 56]
to lay stress on the fact of {%death%} itself (although the death
be that of an enemy) and perhaps too on the condition of
death being caused by a {%vaidik%} kind of incantation ({%Medh.%}
to 11. 63.: {#aBicAro vEdikena SApAdinA mantraprayogeRa Sye-#}
{#nAdiyAgena vA SatrumAraRam,#} or to 11. 197.: {#vEdikena japaho-#}
{#mAdinA SatrormAraRamaBicAraH#}); for the same reason, pro-
bably, both comm. agree in giving to the penalty clause
(9. 290) the additional sense: ‘if the incantation does {%not%}
{%cause death%}’, and qualify, in the clause 11. 197., the incan-
tation as one ‘directed against a person who ought not to have
been brought under the spell (i. e. an innocent or unoffending
person)’; some however, as results from {%Medh.'%}s discussion
on the latter verse, give it a different bearing, for they supply
the preceding word {#yAjana#} at {#aBicAra#} and subject thus to the
penance Kṛchchhra, not the {#yajamAna#} or the person who
institutes an incantatory sacrifice, but the {#ftvij#} or the
priest who performs for him such a sacrifice. But in spite
of these efforts of the commentators to establish a harmony
between Manu and the Veda, it will seem that another
possibility alluded to by {%Medhātithi%} is more plausible, viz.
that Manu did not attach any scriptural authority to such
voluntary rites, as the incantatory sacrifices, and, there-
fore, did not consider himself at variance with the Veda,
when he interdicted incantations in an unqualified manner;
({%Medhātithi:%} {#nanu ca kAmyAnyapi nizidDAni . kAmAtmatA na praSa-#}
{#steti . yattasya vizayaH . sa tatrEva vyAKyAtaH#}). E. {#car#} with
{#aBi,#} kṛt aff. {#GaY#}.
