{#agnihotra#}¦ I. Bahuvr. n. ({#-tram#}) <sup>1</sup> A sacrificial ceremony which
consists in making oblations to fire, of milk (payas), curds
(dadhi), sour gruel (yavāgū), clarified butter (ghṛta), boiled
rice (odana), grain (tanḍula), the juice of the Soma plant,
flesh, sesamum oil (taila) and kidney beans (māṣa), or as

sour gruel. There are two kinds, 1. the nitya, perpetual,
‘during the whole life’ or that Agnihotra which is addressed
to Agni every evening at sunset and to Sūrya every morning
at sunrise; and 2. the kāmya, voluntary or the Agnihotra
which occurs only occasionally and which is performed for
the attainment of some specific object, as the Mṛtāgnihotra
or the Māsāgnihotra in the beginning of the Sattra Kun-
ḍapāyināmayana. <sup>2</sup> The same as {#agnyADAna#} q. v. E. {#agni#}
and {#hotra,#} sc. {#karman#} ‘an act in which oblations are made
to Agni’.
