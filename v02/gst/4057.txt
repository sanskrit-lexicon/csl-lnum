{#anDakArita#}¦ m. f. n. ({#-taH-tA-tam#}) Become dark. E. {#anDakAra,#}
taddh. aff. {#itac#}. (This etym. is probably merely given to in-
dicate that the word is udātta on the last syllable; which it
would not be if {#anDakArita#} were analyzed (as it really ought
to be) as a past partic. of a denomin. {#anDakAri#} from {#anDakAra#}.)
