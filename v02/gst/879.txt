{#ajahatsvArTA#}¦ Tatpur. f. ({#-rTA#}) A figure of speech, the cha-
racteristic of the {#upAdAnalakzaRA#} q. v. It consists in using
a word in an elliptic meaning without depriving it of its
primary sense; in such phrases as {#Sveto DAvati#} or {#kuntAH#}
{#praviSanti,#} are to be supplied {#aSva#} &c. in the former, {#pu-#}
{#ruza#} &c. in the latter, so as to impart the sense of ‘a white
horse gallops’, ‘the men with lances enter’, while {#Sveta#}
and {#kunta#} retain their original sense. See, on the contrary,
{#jahatsvArTA#}.--E. {#a#} neg. and {#jahatsvArTA,#} scil. {#lakzaRA#}.
