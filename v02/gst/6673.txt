<sup>1</sup> Sick, diseased. <sup>2</sup> Arrived, come, taken place; e. g.

{#mitatrAsamAsvAntASezadigjagat#} ({%Jayam.:%} {#aBya° = aBigata-#}

{#kenacit#}--[The first meaning, for which no corroborative
passage in the literature has come under my observation,
rests on the authority of the {%Koshas%} of {%Amara, Hemach.,%}
the {%Rājanigh.%} and the comm.--{%Kāśikā%} to {%Pāṇ.%} VII. 2. 28.
gives the instances {#aByamita#} and {#aByAnta#} (while the {%Siddhk.%}
only has the simple forms {#amita#} and {#Anta,#} and {%Kātyāy.%}
and {%Patanjali%} offer no remark at all), but without stating
their meaning. {%Mādhava%} quotes in the {%Dhātuvṛ.%} the alleged
{%Sūtra%} and the simple forms {#amita#} and {#Anta,#} but under
{#am#} ‘to go, to honour, to sound’, not under {#am#} ‘to be
sick’; and, what is more remarkable, {%Hemach.,%} too, quotes
in the {%Dhātūparāyaṇa%} {#aByamita#} and {#aByAnta#} under {#am#} ‘to
sound, to honour’ to which he refers {#am#} ‘to go’, but
not under {#am#} ‘to be sick’. It will seem therefore, that
the meaning ‘diseased’ of these participles is a doubtful
one.--Unless {%Durga'%}s meaning ‘uninjured’ is merely con-
structive or explanatory of a (possible) meaning ‘attacking’
(viz. successfully attacking), the E. he has derived it from,
is unknown to me.] E. {#am#} with {#aBi,#} kṛt aff. {#kta#} and
