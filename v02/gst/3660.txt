{#anokaha#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-haH#}) A tree. The native E. is very im-
probable: {#anas-aka#} (going) and {#ha#} ‘because a tree impedes
the progress of carts’; probably from {#a#} neg. and {#oka#} (in-
stead of {#okas;#} compare the preceding) and {#ha#} (from {#hA#})
‘because it does not quit its house’.
