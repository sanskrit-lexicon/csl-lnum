{#apapAtra#}¦ Bahuvr. m. f. n. ({#-traH-trA-tram#}) Deprived of vessels.
According to {%Manu,%} Chāṇḍālas and Śvapachas--the lowest
tribes who are not permitted to reside within the precincts
of a Brāhmanic community--must be deprived also of
vessels, since no vessel used by them, as Kullūka observes,
is capable of purification. E. {#apa#} and {#pAtra#}.
