{#aptu#}¦ m. ({#-ptuH#}) (ved.) <sup>1</sup> Soma. <sup>2</sup> A sacrificial animal. <sup>3</sup> Body.
<sup>4</sup> A desired object, or object of desire (perhaps more cor-
rectly: attainment, scil. of a desired object). <sup>5</sup> Possessing,
comprising. [The two first meanings are two various inter-
pretations of the word in {%Vājas.%} 5. 35. or {%Śatap.%} III. 6. 3. 8.:
{#juzARo apturAjyasya vetu#} (quoted also by the {%Kāśikā%} on {%Pāṇ.%}
VI. 1. 118.), viz. {%Śayaṇa:%} {#aptuH sUkzmarUpaH somaH,#} or {%Mahīdh.:%}
{#aptuScAtra somaH . Apnoti pItaH saYCarIram#} i. e. ‘Soma, be-
cause it comes into the body’; and {%Nṛsinha%} in the {%Swara-%}
{%mañjarī:%} {#apturyajYiyaH paSuH#} (probably as connected with
{#aptas#}); the third meaning is that given by {%-Bhaṭṭojid.%} on
the {%Uṇ. Sūtra%} 1. 74. (perhaps because body is pervaded by
Soma); the fourth meaning results from {%Bhaṭṭoj.'%}s {%Prauḍham.%}
but belongs apparently to the word only in {#aptoryAma#} q. v.
where it would have also the fifth meaning, according to a
passage from the Śatap. quoted s. v. {#aptoryAma;#} in either
of the last two meanings {#aptoH#} represents probably the
{%abl.%} of the abstract noun in {#-tu#} which in the Vedas often
assumes the function of our infinitive, expressed in the
classical idiom by the accus. {#-tum, aptos#} being thus equal
in value to the classical {#Aptum#}.] E. {#Ap#} with shortened
{#A#} (accord. to the native etym., but more correctly {#ap,#}
comp. the etym. of {#apta#}), uṇ. aff. {#tu#}.
