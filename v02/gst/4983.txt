{#apasidDAnta#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-ntaH#}) <sup>1</sup> A false conclusion; e. g. {#mUrta-#}
{#tvAdGawAdivatsamAnaDarmApattAvapasidDAntaH#} ‘(to say that the
Soul is limited) is a false conclusion, for this would lead
to assert that, from its having shape, it shares in the
properties of material substances (as in those of perishable-
ness &c.)’; or {#AnandABivyaktirmuKyamokza iti navInavedAnti-#}
{#nAmapasidDAnta eveti Dik#} ‘to maintain that manifestation of
happiness is real liberation is a wrong conclusion of the
modern Vedāntists: shame (on such twaddle)’. <sup>2</sup> (In the
Nyāya philosophy.) Logical inconsistency in argumentation,
viz. arguing so as to come in contradiction with the tenets
of one's own school; one of the twenty two {#nigrahasTAna#}
or failures in discussion which lead to the defeat of the
disputant; more especially it is thus defined: {#sidDAntamaByu-#}
{#petyAniyamAtkaTAprasaNgo'pasidDAntaH#} ‘{%apasiddhānta%} is ar-
gumentation without regard to the definitions contained in
the tenets of a school which one has adopted as his own’.--
The commentator adds however that there is no {#apasidDAnta#}
or inconsistency of this kind, if one differs merely in a
special topic from the authority of his school: {#yastvekade-#}
{#Simatena kaTAmAraBate tasya SAstrakArAByupagamaviroDe nApasi-#}
{#dDAntaH;#} ‘the Saugatas’, he says, ‘do not consider logical
inconsistency as a defect, but that is another question’ ({#sO-#}
{#gatAstvapasidDAntaM dUzaRaM na manyanta ityanyadetat#}). E. {#apa#} and
{#sidDAnta#}.
