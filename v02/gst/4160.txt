{#annAda#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-daH-dI-dam#}) Eating food &c. (see
the meanings of {#anna#}); also eating the metaphysical or
mystical {#anna#} 2. 2.; said e. g. of the Supreme Soul {#‘aha-#}
{#mannamahamannAdaH’#} (comm. {#advEta AtmA niraYjano'pi sannaha-#}
{#mevAnnamannAdaSca#}); or {#‘sEzA virAqannAdI’#} (comm. {#sEzA vi-#}
{#rAqdaSasaMKyA satyannaM cAnnAdinI ca#}). E. {#anna#} and {#Ada#} ({#ad,#}
kṛt aff. {#aR#}). [NB. This etymol. is the regular one, but
according to the comm. of Pāṇ., restricted to the classical
dialect; in the Vedas the word is treated as if the latter
part were {#ada#} ({#ad,#} kṛt aff. {#ac#}) or, in other words: {#annAda,#}
[Page137-b+ 56]
fem. {#°dI#} is in the vaidik literature udātta on the last syl-
lable, while in the classical dialect it would be udātta on
the first. This is the bearing of the instance {#annAdAya#}
(dative of {#annAda#}) in the comm. on the Kārikā to Pāṇini
III. 1. 85., when the comm. observes {#‘aRvizaye'c’;#} comp.
Mahābhāṣya on Pāṇ. III. 2. 1.; {#‘annAdAyeti ca kftAM vyatya-#}
{#yaSCandasi’ . annAdAyeti ca kftAM vyatyayaSCandasi drazwavyaH .#}
{#annAdAyAnnapataye . AhutimannAdIM hutvA . karmaRyaR;#} where-
upon Kaiyyaṭa: {#annAdAyeti . annamattItyaRaH prasaNge'cpratyayaH#}
{#kriyate . tena anna'adAyetyevamavagraha upapadyate#}.--In the
present edition of Pāṇini there is a misprint {#annAdAyaH#} in-
stead of {#annAdAya#} (the latter being correctly given in the
corresponding place of the Siddh. Kaum. fol. 217 b. line 15);
in the mutilated reprint of that edition the error has been
repeated, as in similar cases, and somewhere else a new
vaidik word has been founded on it viz ‘{#annAdAya#} adj. ved.’
with a meaning ‘taking food’ and with an etymology ‘{#anna#}
and {#AdAya#}’; it needs not be observed that the quoted words
{#‘aRvizaye'c’#} would become quite meaningless with such a
formation ‘{#annAdAya#} adj.’, since the āgama {#yuk#} could not
occur in a derivative with kṛt aff. {#ac#}.]
