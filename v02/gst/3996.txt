{#antyapada#}¦ Karmadh. n. ({#-dam#}) (In Arithmetic.) The last or
greatest root in the affected square; also called {#antyamUla,#}
{#jyezWapada, jyezWamUla#} and opposed to the {#Adyapada#} or {#AdyamUla,#}
{#kanizWapada#} or {#kanizWamUla#} ‘the least or first root’. These terms
are thus explained after Brahmagupta by Colebrooke; ‘the
[Page130-a+ 56]
least or first root: that quantity of which the square multi-
plied by the given multiplicator and having the given ad-
dend added, or subtrahend subtracted, is capable of af-
fording an exact square root; the greatest or last root:
the square root which is extracted from the quantity so
operated upon’. E. {#antya#} and {#pada#}.
