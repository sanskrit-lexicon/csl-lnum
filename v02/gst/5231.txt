{#apuruzArTa#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-rTaH#}) <sup>1</sup> (In the Mīmānsā philosophy.)
A religious act which is not performed on account of the
gratification of the sacrificer, but because it is essential to
the sacrifice itself; see {#kratvarTa#}. <sup>2</sup> (In the Sāṅkhya philos.)
Not the chief object of the Soul; occurring in the Sūtras
in its abstract deriv. {#apuruzArTatva;#} e. g. {#apuruzArTatvamuBayaTA#}
‘in neither way is (nihilism) the chief end of the Soul’; or
{#nAnuSrAvikAdapi tatsidDiH sADyatvenAvfttiyogAdapuruzArTatvam#}
‘the accomplishment thereof (i. e. of liberation) does not
arise, moreover, from scriptural means, for since trans-
migration is connected with the result (of religious acts,
the performance of such acts) is not the chief object of the
Soul’; or {#suKalABABAvAdapuruzArTatvamiti cenna dvEviDyAt#} ‘if
you reason that, since there is no such a thing as obtain-
ing happiness, (final liberation as the absence of pain) is not
the chief object of the Soul, you are wrong, for its object
is twofold (viz. obtaining happiness and not having pain)’.
E. {#a#} neg. and {#puruzArTa#}.
