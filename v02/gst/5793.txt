{#abDija#}¦ Tatpur. 1. m. f. n. ({#-jaH-jA-jam#}) Born in or by the
ocean.
<div n="P">2. <sup>a.</sup> m. sing. ({#-jaH#}) <sup>1</sup> The moon; comp. {#abja#}. <sup>2</sup> (In
mathematical language sometimes used to denote) the nu-
meral {%1.%} <sup>3</sup> Cuttle fish bone; the same as {#abDikaPa#} or {#sa-#}
{#mudraPena#} (according to the {%Nigh. Prak.%}), comp. also {#arRavaja#}.
(The meaning ‘moon’ is not given in the Koshas; but as
the word occurs in the second meaning, in a mathematical
Index, similarly as {#amftadIDiti,#} and as the synonymes
of {#candra#} q. v. are used likewise so, it seemed to me neces-
sary to infer this mathematical application from the mean-
ing ‘moon’, which would arise from the etymon of the
word in the same way as {#abja#} 2. 1. q. v. Comp. also {#Sve-#}
{#taDAman#} ‘moon and cuttle fish bone’.)
<div n="P"><sup>b.</sup> m. du. ({#-jO#}) A name of the Aśvins q. v., these two
gods having sprung from the ocean when it was churned
for the amṛta.

ing come from the ocean when it was churned for the amṛta.
E. {#abDi#} and {#ja#}.
