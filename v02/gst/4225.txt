{#anyatva#}¦ n. ({#-tvam#}) The being other, otherness, difference
(the same as {#anyatA,#} but more frequently used as this
word); e. g. {#anyatve'pyaByAsasyopacArAt#} ‘even if there
were different (sounds, sound must be permanent) because
it is possible to repeat it (in teaching)’; also with a noun
in the ablative, e. g. {#vacanAttu tato'nyatvam#} ‘(if it is main-
tained that {#itikartavyatA#} refers to profane things, the answer
is:) but on account of a (distinct vaidik) passage its dif-
ference from that (is established), i. e. it refers only to sacred
or vaidik objects’; or {#tayoranyatve tucCatvam#} (comm. {#akA-#}
{#ryasya prakftipuruzaBinnatve tucCatvam#} &c.).--The word occurs
[Page142-a+ 56]
for the most part, however, as the latter part of a com-
pound--e. g. {#sPawikAnyatvABimAnavattadanyatvABimAnaH#}--
and especially in scientific writings, e. g. in the Vārttikas
of Pāṇini in compounds as {#aNgAnyatva, kartranyatva, kArakAnyatva,#}
{#kAlAnyatva,#} in the Vedānta Sūtras as in {#tadananyatva,#} in the
Mīmānsā S. as in {#prayojanAnyatva, vedAnyatva, rUpAnyatva#} &c.,
in the Nyāya S. as in {#sTAnAnyatva, karmAnyatva,#} in the Sāṅkhya
S. {#uBayAnyatva,#} in the Yoga S. as in {#kramAnyatva#} &c. &c. E.
