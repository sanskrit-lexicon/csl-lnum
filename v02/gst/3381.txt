{#anuSaya#}¦ Tatpur. I. m. ({#-yaH#}) <sup>1</sup> Connexion, attachment; comp.
{#anuSayin#}. <sup>2</sup> (In the Vedānta philos.) That consequence of
an act which compels the soul to descend again on earth,
after she has enjoyed in the other world those consequences
of her acts which allowed her to soar; that consequence,
as it were, that cleaves to the soul and does not permit
her to enjoy freedom from transmigration ({#‘AmuzmikaPale#}
{#karmajAte upaBukte'vaSizwamEhikaPalaM karmAntarajAtamanuSayaH’#});
the {#anuSaya#} varies according to its qualities; if it is ‘hand-
some’ ({#ramaRIya#}) the soul is reborn as a ‘Brāhmaṇa, Ksha-
triya or Vaiśya’; if it is ‘contemptible’ ({#kapUya#}) it animates
‘a dog, a hog or a Chānḍāla’. <sup>3</sup> Repentance, regret. <sup>4</sup> Hatred,
[Page105-a+ 56]
resentment. <sup>5</sup> Deep or intense enmity, enmity which goes
far in its consequences; e. g. {#SiSupAlo'nuSayaM paraM gataH#}
(comm.: {#paramanuSayaM kevalaM na saptavyaH kiM tu hantavyaSceti dIrGa-#}
{#dvezaM gataH#}). <sup>6</sup> A certain country or place (? the meaning thus
rendered in a comm. is {#deSaviSeza#}).
<div n="P">II. f. ({#-yI#}) (In Medicine.) <sup>1</sup> A disease of the feet, a small
abscess on the upper part, ‘deep, causing little pain, and of
the natural colour as the limb’. <sup>2</sup> (According to another)
An abscess on the head ({#mastakopari#}) of the same symptoms
as described before. E. {#SI#} with {#anu,#} kṛt aff. {#ac;#} the
femin. in {#I#} would be an anomaly accord. to this etym.
