{#aBivyAdAna#}¦ Bahuvr. n. ({#-nam#}) (In vaidik Grammar.) A sup-
pressed sound; viz. such a long vowel {#A,#} separated from
a preceding {#A#} by a hiatus, as becomes {%wrongly%} absorbed
by the protracting beyond the legitimate measure of such a
preceding {#A;#} as if in the pronunciation of {#tA ApaH, avasA#}
{#A, yA ApaH, tA A#} (in verses of the Ṛgveda), the
speaker commits the fault of allowing the final {#A#} of {#tA,#}
{#avasA, yA#} to absorb, by unduly protracting it, the be-
ginning {#A#} of {#ApaH#} and {#A#}. [In the {%Ṛk-Prātiś.-Sūtra%}
{#aBivyAdAnaM ca vivfttipUrve kaRWye tA Apo'vasA eti#}
{#dIrGe#} it would seem more natural to look upon {#aBivyAdAna#}
as a Tatpur. and render it ‘absorption’; but as {#vyAdAna#}
means ‘enouncing, pronouncing’ and as a negative value
of {#aBi#} is but seldom admissible in a {%Tatpur.,%} it appears
better to adopt {%Uvaṭa'%}s comment which represents the
word as a {%Bahuvr.%} and supplies {#akzara,#} viz.: {#AdAnamAramBaH .#}
{#viviDaM vipulaM viSAlaM vAdAnamaTavAdAnameva vyAdAnam . kena-#}
{#cidaBivyAptamaBiBUtaM vA vyAdAnaM tasya tadidamaBivyAdAnaM Bava-#}
{#tyakzaram;#} and since the condition of {%this%} defect of pronun-
ciation is the meeting of {%two%} {#A,#} there seems equally no
choice left but to adopt the elliptical interpretation of this
comm., as regards {#vivfttipUrve kaRWye dIrGe,#} which words he
renders as neuters in the dual accus., for in giving them
the apparently more natural value of a locat. sing. the rule
would not necessarily imply the meeting of {%two%} long vowels
{#A#}.] E. {#aBi#} and {#vyAdAna,#} scil. {#akzara#}.
