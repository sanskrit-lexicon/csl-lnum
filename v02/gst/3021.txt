{#anunAsika#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-kaH-kA-kam#}) (In Grammar.) Uttered
through the nose, nasal (see also {#rakta#}), viz. <sup>1</sup> A nasal sound
in general, it being pronounced through the nose and with
the appropriate organ of speech, as {#N#} through the nose
and the throat, {#Y#} through the nose and with the palate &c.
<sup>2</sup> (Conditionally) a vowel or {#y, v, l;#} in this case the nasal
nature of the sound is indicated by the sign {#M~#}. (N. B. {#yM~#} or
{#vM~#} represent the value of {#y#} or {#v#} preceded by {#m; lM~#} that
of {#l#} preceded by {#m#} or {#n#}. In the pause a final vowel may
be anunāsika. A {%short%} anunāsika vowel, when not occurr-
ing in a pause, represents apparently always the value of
the same vowel and {#m#} or {#n;#} it must be, in general, the
last vowel sound of the former part of a compound or of
the word itself, followed by a final sibilant, e. g. {#saM~skartA#}
instead of {#sams-kartA, puM~ScalI = pums-calI, tasmiM~stvA =#}
{#tasmins-tvA#}. Only a few exceptions of this rule are mentioned
by the vaidik grammarians, e. g. {#aminantaM~ evEH,#} when {#a#} of {#nta#}
is anunāsika, although it does neither stand in a pause nor
represent more than its own sound.--A {%long%} anunāsika
vowel, when not occurring in a pause, may be generally
considered as representing the value of its short vowel and
an original {#nts#} or of its short vowel and {#nt,#} provided {#s#} or
its substitute has been preserved; e. g. {#mahAM~ indraH = mahants#}
{#indraH, daDanvAM~ yaH = daDanvants yaH, sargAM~ iva = sargants iva#}
or {#mahAM~Scarati = mahants carati, dasyUM~rekaH = dasyunts ekaH#}.
The material difference that prevails between the anunāsika
({#M~#}) and the anusvāra ({#M#}) sound, does not appear to have
been kept alive beyond the period of the vaidik literature,
when an interchange between both was not deemed legiti-
mate; according to the grammarians of the classical period,
in the latter the anunāsika may be replaced by the anu-
svāra. The sign of the anunāsika ({#M~#}), however, is but
seldom met with in the ordinary Mss. referring to the post-
vaidik literature; and from the reasons stated, its use in
vaidik Mss. is objectionable, when it occurs in words like
{#yaSAM~si, DanUM~zi, viSvezAM~ hitaH#} or in {#maM~hizWa, vAjaM~ sanizat, indraM~#}
{#stavAma#} and similar instances in which the long nasal vowel
does not represent more than the value of a short vowel
and a nasal, or in which the short nasal vowel is not fol-
lowed by a final sibilant.) E. {#anu#} and {#nAsikA#}.
