{#atri#}¦ m. ({#-triH#}) <sup>1</sup> Eater, devourer (in the Vedas especially as
an epithet of Agni, the divinity of fire). <sup>2</sup> The name of a
Maharshi or a great Saint, who in the Vedas occurs especi-
ally in hymns composed for the praise of Agni, Indra, the
Aśvins and the Viśvadevas; and who in the epic period
is considered as one of the ten Prajāpatis or lords of crea-
tion engendered by Manu for the purpose of creating the
universe; at a later period he appears as a mindborn son
of Brahmā and as one of the seven Ṛṣis who preside
over the reign of Svāyambhuva, the first, or according to
others of Svārochiṣa, the second, or of Vaivaswata, the
seventh Manu; he is married to Anasūyā, the daughter of
Daksha and their son is Durvāsas. Produced by a flash of
light from his eye which was received by Space, the via
lactea personified, or according to a more recent legend,
by his penitence, is Soma or the moon. See {#atrijAta,#}
{#atridfgja, atrinetraja#} &c. As sons of his are also named
the Manes Barhishads and Udamaya; a daughter of his is
Apālā. The name of Atri occurs also as that of the author
of several vaidik hymns, as that of an inspired legislator,
of the author of an astronomical and medical work and,
in astronomy, as one of the seven Ṛṣis in the constel-
lation of the great bear.--An Atri, son of Sāṅkhya, but
probably a different personage, is the author of a hymn in
the Ṛgveda.--Amongst the authors of vaidik hymns we
find as sons or descendants of Atri the following: Archa-
nāna, Avasyu, Bāhuvṛkta, Bhauma, Budha, Dvita, Ga-
viṣṭhira, Gaya, Gopavana, Isha, Paura, Pratibhānu, Pra-
tiprabha, the Prayaswats, Purīṣa, Ratahavya, Sadāpṛṇa,
Saptavadhri, Śaśa, Satyaśravas, Śrutavid, Sutambhara,
Śyāvāśva, Vasuśruta, the Vasūyus, Viśvasāman, Yajata;
and as daughters of Atri, Apālā, Gātu, Viśvavārā. <sup>3</sup> m.
pl. ({#atrayaH#}) The descendants (see {#gotra#}) of Atri collectively.
(The masc. plur. {#atrayaH#} is considered as the plur. of the
patronymic {#Atreya#} (q. v.) with luk of the taddh. aff. {#Qak;#}
the plural of the fem., however, remaining regular, viz.
{#AtreyyaH;#} but there is no necessity to adopt this artificial
etymology which is given to connect the sense of the pa-
tronymic with that of the plur. of the original form.) E.
