{#aBihvAra#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-raH#}) (ved. Probably.) Evil, misfor-
tune, sin; e. g. {%Atharv.:%} {#yo asya samiDaM veda kzatriyeRa samA-#}
{#hitAm . nABihvAre padaM ni daDAti sa mftyave#} ‘he does
not put his foot into misfortune (or into sin which leads)
to death’. ({%Roth%} and {%Whitney%} in their edition of the
{%Atharv.%} write {#aBihvAra;#} but the former gives in a quotation
of this passage in his Dictionary the form {#aBihvara#} which
seems less correct.) E. {#hvf#} with {#aBi,#} kṛt aff. {#GaY#}.
