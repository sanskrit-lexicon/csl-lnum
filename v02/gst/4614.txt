{#apadiSam#}¦ Avyayībh. Between two regions of the compass
(as south-east &c.). [The {%Siddhāntakaum.%} appears to assume
also a neuter {#apadiSa (-Sam)#} ‘intermediate space of the
compass’, since it explains {#apadiSam#} as representing the
value of the instrum. or locative of {#apadiSa#} viz. {#‘apadiSam .#}
{#apadiSena . apadiSam . apadiSe’;#} but the comm. on the
{%Amarak.%} I. 1. 2. 7. take the words {#‘klIvAvyayam’#} mentioned
there, expressly as meaning ‘Avyayībh.’ and as imparting
moreover to {#apa#} in {#apadiSam#} the meaning ‘in the middle of’.
{%Svāmin%} explains {#apadiSam#} as representing the value of a
case of {#diS#} (comp. Pāṇ. II. 1. 6), but {%Bhanūjid.%} refutes
him in contending that the word could not imply then the
notion of ‘in the middle of’: {#‘diSoridamapadiSaM viBaktyarTe#}
{#'vyayIBAva iti svAmI . tanna . saMbanDamAtrasya viBaktyarTatve'pi#}
{#maDyasya tadarTatvABAvAt’#}.--It seems unnecessary, however,
[Page163-a+ 56]
to create a new meaning of {#apa#} on account of this com-
pound, as {#apadiSam#} could well signify literally ‘away from
one region and another’ i. e. between both. For a similar
interpretation of {#apa#} comp. {#apasalavi#}.] E. {#apa#} and {#diS,#}
samās. aff. {#wac,#} or {#apa#} and {#diSA#}.
