{#anantavAta#}¦ Karmadh. m. ({#-taH#}) (In medicine.) One of the
diseases of the head (see {#Siroroga#}). It is described in the
following manner: ‘when the three humours (air, bile and
phlegm) are deranged in the vessels of the back of the
neck they make it very feverish and painful and it sup-
presses the humours particularly in the region of the eyes,
eyebrows and temples; it then produces shaking in the
sides of the cheeks, cramp of the jaws and morbid affec-
tions of the eyes’. E. {#ananta#} and {#vAta#}.
