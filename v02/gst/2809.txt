{#anIcidarSin#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-rSI#}) The name of a Bauddha
saint. E. {#anIci(?)#} and {#darSin#}. (The reading of this word
is doubtful, and the correct form is probably {#avIcidarSin;#}
from {#avIci#} the last of the eight fiery hells of the Bud-
dhists and {#darSin,#} ‘seeing’; as an Arhat, who has made
himself conversant with the whole doctrine of Sākyamuni,
is promised to penetrate with his sight all the worlds,
‘from the highest summit of existence, down to the great
hell Avīchi’.)
