{#apyayadIkzita#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-taH#}) The name of a celebrated
Dravida Brahmaṇa, the son of {%Nārāyaṇadīkṣita;%} he lived
at Agrahara and flourished in the 16<sup>th</sup> century of Śālivā-
hana; his contemporaries considered him as an emanation
of Śiva on account of his devotion for this god and his
great learning, for ‘at the age of twelve years he perfectly
studied the Vedas and was besides master of several ab-
struse sciences’. In his crusade for establishing the supe-
riority of Śivaism he was once waylayed in a forest by
ruffians, hired by one of his unvictorious opponents at the
court of Vankatapati, but rescued by timely aid. He
died at Chillumbrum, as it appears, at the age of ninety.
He is said to be the author of 84 books on theology, rhe-
toric and philosophy. {%Colebrooke%} names (essays I. 333. 337)

cabulary of his is mentioned in {%Weber'%}s Catalogue of the

the {%Ātmārpaṇa.%}--His name occurs also in the shape of

{#dIkzita, apyayya;#} but he is not the same as {#appa#} q. v. E.
