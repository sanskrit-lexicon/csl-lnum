{#apad#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-t-t-t#}) (ved.) Going on a road
which does not exist or which is unknown. [In the passage
in which this word occurs, {%Śatap.%} XIV. 8. 15. 10., it is an
epithet of {#gAyatrI,#} which for mystical reasons has been
called previously {#ekapadI#} ‘one-footed’, {#dvipadI#} ‘two-footed’,
{#tripadI#} ‘three-footed’ and {#catuzpadI#} ‘four-footed’; {%Dwiveda-%}
{%ganga%} on the {%Śatapathabr.%} explains {#apad#} ‘because a {#pada#} i. e.
by what she may be known does not exist’--{#padyase jYA-#}
{#yase yena tatpadaM na vidyate yasyAH sA tvamapadasi#}--; but ac-
cording to this gloss {#apad#} would be a Bahuvr., while its
accent--the udātta on the first syllable--assigns it to
the class of Tatpur. compounds. The interpretation of {%Śan-%}
{%kara%} on the same passage in the {%Bṛhadār.%} seems therefore
preferable: {#avidyamAnaM padaM yena padyase sA tvamapadasi#} ‘thou
art {#apad#} because thou goest on a road which does not
exist or which is unknown’.--In no case can the word
[Page162-b+ 56]
mean ‘footless’, for its form would then be {#apadI#} and its
accent the udātta on the penultima.--Bahuvr. forms
like {#apade, apadI#} &c. belong to the base {#apAd#} q. v., not
to a base {#apad#}.] E. {#a#} neg. and {#pad#} (with an ellipsis of {#pada#}).
