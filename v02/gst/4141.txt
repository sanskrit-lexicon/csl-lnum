{#annavikAra#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-raH#}) <sup>1</sup> Transformation of food; used
in general of any preparation of an article of food, e. g. of
{#saktu, puroqASa, surA, yavasurA, pizwasurA#} (comp. s. v. {#anna-#}
{#mala#}); according to an observation of Vardhamāna, however,
only of an artificial preparation, of made dishes, e. g. of
sweetmeats, {#SazkulImodaka#} &c. (which would include, too,
the given instances {#saktu#} &c. occurring in the Mahābhāṣya,
Kāśikā, Bhaṭṭikāvya &c.), not of preparations which re-
present, as it were, the original substance only in a different
shape, as of {#pfTuka,#} rice or grain flattened, {#apUpa,#} cake of
flour &c. (This observation is in accordance, also, with
the author of the gaṇa {#apUpAdi#} to Pāṇ. V. 1. 4. where the
words {#apUpa#} and {#pfTuka#} occur besides {#annavikAra#}). <sup>2</sup> The
seminal secretion. <sup>3</sup> Transformation of the metaphysical
or mystical food; see {#anna#} 2. 2. and compare {#annavikAratva#}.
E. {#anna#} and {#vikAra#}.
