{#apUrvya#}¦ I. (ved.) Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-vyaH-vyA-vyam#}) Not referring
to, not being in, not visible in, what is prior or has
existed before; e. g. {#uzas,#} dawn, ‘since it is not seen in the
night-time which precedes it’; hence also: new, not made
or existed before, as hymns (‘which have never been com-
posed before’), or as Agni (as he is ever new through his
splendour’) &c. E. {#a#} neg. and {#pUrvya#} (referring &c. to what
precedes or is prior).
<div n="P">II. m. f. n. ({#-rvyaH-rvyA-rvyam#}) Worth of what has not existed
before, deserving what is extraordinary or excellent (viz.
the Soma-drink), an epithet of Vāyu (according to {%Sāyaṇa,%}
who explains the word in the {%Ṛgv.%} verse: {#tvaM no vAyave-#}
{#zAmapUrvyaH somAnAM praTamaH pItimarhasi,#} in this way: {#na vi-#}
{#dyate pUrvaM yasmAttatpAnamapUrvam . tadarhatItyapUrvyaH#}--comp. {%Pāṇ.%}
V. 1. 67.--; but as the word is udātta on the first syllable
the correctness of his interpretation, seems doubtful; the
word might well be, and have the meaning of, the Tatpur.
also in the quoted verse. E. {#apUrva,#} taddh. aff. {#yat#}.
