{#aTarvI#}¦ Tatpur. f. ({#-vI#}). This word occurs only in the Veda
and is explained ‘not going, unable to move’, from {#a#}
neg. and {#TarvI#} (from {#Tarv,#} to go). It would seem, how-
ever, that it is a Tatpur. composed of the obsolete word
{#aTar,#} fire, and {#vI,#} ‘surrounded by fire’(?). See the E.
of {#aTarvan#} and {#aTarI#}.
