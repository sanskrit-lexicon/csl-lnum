{#aputra#}¦ I. Tatpur. m. ({#-traH#}) One who is not a son. E. {#a#}
neg. and {#putra#}.
<div n="P">II. Bahuvr. m. f. ({#-traH-trA#}) Sonless; one who has either
had no son or lost his (her) son or sons ({#aputro'jAtaputro mfta-#}
{#putro vA#}) and is legally held to adopt one ({%Atri:%} {#aputreREva#}
{#kartavyaH putrapratiniDiH sadA . piRqodakakriyAhetoryasmAttasmA-#}
{#tprayatnataH#}). {%Manu%} uses the term also impliedly of a man
who has no son by a woman of the three first classes,
although he may have a son by a Śūdrā woman, as re-
sults from this verse: {#yadyapi syAttu satputro yadyaputro'pi vA#}
{#Bavet . nADikaM daSamAddadyAcCUdrAputrAya DarmataH#} (and {%Vṛ-%}
{%haspati%} employs in a similar manner the term {#anapatya,#} viz.
{#anapatyasya SuSrUzurguRavAYCUdrayonijaH . laBetAjIvanaM SezaM sapi-#}
{#RqAH samavApnuyuH#}); when {%Jīmūtavāhana%} moreover observes
that the son of a Śūdrā in this verse applies to the legiti-
mate son, the Pāraśava (q. v.) being the son of a Brāhmana
by a Śūdrā not wedded to him ({#yaccAha manuH . yaM brAhmaRastu#}
{#SUdrAyAM#} &c. {%Manu%} 9. 178. {#. tadapariRItaSUdrAsutABiprAyam;#}
contrary to {%Kullūka%} who defines him as {#pariRItAyAmeva#}
{#SUdrAyAM brAhmaRaH kAmAdyaM putraM janayet#} &c.).--A wife who
has no son must be approached for the sake of getting one
by her brother-in-law or by one of her relatives of the
Sapiṇḍa class.--Although {%Likhita%} places a man who has
no son in the same category with an impious man, a usurer
[Page196-a+ 56]
and a Śūdra, when he inflicts a fast of three days on any
one who eats the food of such a person ({#BuktvA vArDuzika-#}
{#syAnnamavratasyAsutasya ca . SUdrasya ca taTA BuktvA trirAtraM syAda-#}
{#Bojanam#}), the present edition of {%Pāṇini%} gives {#aputra#} in a
{%Gaṇa%} (to VIII. 1. 67.) as a {%honorific%} term when it is the first
part of a {%Karmadh.%} (the latter part of such a compound
being anudātta); but on the other hand, as {#aputra#} is one of
the thirty-four nativities from the knowledge of which
{%Śākyamuni%} derives a special name (comp. {#catustriMSajjAta-#}
{#kajYa#}), it would seem that the word in this sense belongs
rather to the Buddhistic than to the Brāhmanic literature;
compare e. g. the Pāli word aputtakaseṭṭhī, in {%Fansböll'%}s
{%Dhammapadam%} p. 415. The {%Kāśikā%} does not mention {#aputra#}
in the {%Gaṇa%} alluded to. E. {#a#} priv. and {#putra#}.
