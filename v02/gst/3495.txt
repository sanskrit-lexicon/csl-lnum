{#anusvAra#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-raH#}) (In Grammar.) Literally, an after-
sound; the name of a nasal sound which always belongs to
the preceding vowel and according to some is weaker, ac-
cording to others stronger than the {#anunAsika#} q. v. In
writing it is marked by a dot over the vowel after which
it sounds. It shares in the nature as well of consonants as
of vowels: of consonants, in as much as it has but half a
measure of time (or {#mAtrA#}) and with another consonant
makes position: of vowels, by having their properties of
shortness, length, {#pluti#} q. v., and of being capable of ac-
centuation. (The vaidik grammarians call the consonants
and the Anusvāra the ‘body of a syllable’--{#akzarANga#}--.)
On account of the organ of speech with which it is pro-
nounced it belongs to the {#nAsikya#} q. v., and on account of
the mode in which it is uttered to the {#Uzman#} q. v. (see also
{#mahAprARa#}). If a combined consonant follows an Anusvāra
the vaidik grammarians want the first consonant of the group
to be repeated; e. g. {#somAnaM ssvaraRaM#} &c. instead of {#somAnaM#}
{#svaraRaM#} &c.; this rule, however, is neglected in most of our
vaidik Mss. and in all referring to the post-vaidik literature,
although the injunction of the grammarians is doubtless
founded on correct physiological observation and the system
of Sanskrit orthography on a correct imitation in writing
the spoken sound.--At the end of a {#pada#} (q. v.) Anu-
svāra is a substitute for {#m,#} in the middle of a {#pada#} that of
{#m#} or {#n;#} at the end of a {#pada#} it is only allowed to occur
when the {#pada#} does not stand in a pause, and in the middle
not before any other sound than {#S, z, sa#} and {#h,#} before
which it is the compulsory substitute. (These rules, too,
are frequently neglected in spite of the grammatical author-
ities.) It is compulsory, too, at the end of the {#pada,#} before
the same letters and {#r#} save a few exceptions as {#samrAj#} or
when {#h#} is followed by {#m, n#} &c., e. g. {#kiM hmalayati#} or
{#kimhmalayati, kiM hnute#} or {#kinhnute#} &c. For the interchange
and the confusion, that prevails in the classical literature,
between the use of Anusvāra and Anunāsika before {#y,#}
{#l, v#} see s. v. {#anunAsika#}.--A short syllable followed
by Anusvāra (which itself as results from the preceding
statement must always be followed by a consonant) becomes
of the nature of a long syllable, i. e. it becomes {#guru#} or
heavy; but though this is the constant case in the Vedas
[Page109-a+ 56]
and generally in the later literature, it will seem that this rule
may be departed from at the end of a Pāda, as in the instance
of the following first Pāda of the Āryā verse: {#aTa lulitapa-#}
{#tatrimAlaM rugnAsanavARakeSaratamAlam#} &c. where {#trimAlaM#} counts
for ˘¯˘ |. ({#‘yadyapi CandaHSAstre sAnusvArasya gurutvamanuSizwaM#}
{#taTApi taTA pAdAntago'pi veti vacanAttasya laGutvAtpraTama-#}
{#pAde dvAdaSa mAtrA Bavanti’#}.) E. {#svf#} with {#anu,#} kṛt aff. {#GaY#}.
