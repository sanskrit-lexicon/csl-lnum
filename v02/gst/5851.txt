{#aBayagirivihAra#}¦ Karmadh. m. ({#-raH#}) The Buddhist mona-
stery Abhayagiri in Anurādhapura which is said to have
been founded by the king {%Vartagāmani,%} in commemoration
of a taunt held out to him by a Nighaṇṭa Brāhmaṇa of the
name of {%Giri,%} when he fled after an unsuccessful encounter
with the Damila, the king making a vow to build a mona-
stery if he should be victorious; he called it Abhayagiri
from the name of the Brāhmaṇa ({%Giri%}) and the surname
{%Abhaya%} he had assumed himself. (Comp. {%Turnour'%}s {%Mahāv.%}
p. 206 and {%Lassen'%}s {%Ind. Alt.%} II. p. 433.) The monastery is
famed for the sect which inhabited it (see {#aBayagirivAsin#})
and a tope erected in it. (Comp. {%Wilson'%}s {%Ariana Antiqua%}
p. 39 and {%Lassen'%}s {%Ind. Alt.%} II. p. 1008.) E. {#aBaya-giri#}
and {#vihAra#}.
