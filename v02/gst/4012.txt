{#antyAvasTiti#}¦ Tatpur. f. ({#-tiH#}) The size of the Soul when,
according to the Jaina doctrine, it has become liberated
and thus arrived at a final i. e. atomistic state or one of
indivisibility and eternity; or the established condition of
the atomistic and consequently eternal size of the Soul,
when it has attained its final state. (Compare {#antya#} 1. 1.) Śan-
kara gives both interpretations of this word in the Vedānta
Sūtra which alludes to the Jaina theory of the atomistic
nature of the Soul: {#‘antyAvasTiteScoBayanityatvAdaviSezaH’#}.
E. {#antya#} (in the sense of the genitive, scil. {#jIva#}) and {#ava-#}
{#sTiti#}.
