{#anyo'nya#}¦ (usually written {#anyonya#}) Tatpur. (see {#sarvanAman#})
1. m. f. n. ({#-nyaH-nyA-nyam,#} not. {#anyonyad;#} in the other cases
it follows the declension of {#anya#} q. v.) One-another, mutual.--
<sup>a.</sup> The verb in connexion with {#anyonya#} stands (acc. to Pāṇ.) in
the Parasmaipada, not in the Ātmanepada; e. g. {#anyonyasya#}
{#vyatipunanti, anyonyasya vyatilunanti#}.--<sup>b.</sup> If {#anyonya#} refers
to the subject of the sentence and the subject is a mascu-
line, it is possible to consider it as consisting of two dis-
tinct not compound words {#anya,#} the former being a nomi-
native as attribute to the subject, while the latter assumes
the case required by the sentence (see the Etym.); e. g.
{#anyo'nyamAhvayantO tu mattAviva mahAgajO;#} or {#te'nyonyamaBi-#}
{#saMsftya kzipanto nAmaBirmiTaH;#} or {#…kapirAkzasAH . anyo'nyenA-#}
{#ByasUyanta vimardamasahanta ca;#} or in sentences in which the gerond
is used elliptically; e. g. {#tAByAmanyo'nyamAsAdya samavApyata saM-#}
{#SamaH#}.--<sup>c.</sup> There are however many instances in which
{#anyonya#} does not refer to the subject, or in which it is the
attribute of a subject which is not a masculine and there-
fore cannot be looked upon otherwise than as a compound;
e. g. {#anyonyena kftam;#} or {#anyonyasmE dattam;#} or {#anyonyezAM pu-#}
{#zkarErAmfSanto dAnodBedAduccakErBugnavAlAH;#} or as an attribute
of a neuter {#prItyaprItivizAdAdyErguRAnAmanyonyaM vEDarmyam;#} and
the same must be observed of all the words in which {#anyonya#}
is the first part of a compound; comp. e. g. the following
articles and {#anyonyatas#}. <sup>d.</sup> {#anyonyam#} is frequently used ad-
verbially, e. g. {#yadyapyAtmanAmanyonyaM BedavAkyavadaBedavAkyAnyapi#}
{#santi taTApi nAdvEtaM nAtyantamaBedaH.--anyonyam#} or {#anyonyAm#}
are used optionally in the sense of an accusative, if the
subject to which they refer is either a feminine or a neuter;
e. g. {#anyonyamime brAhmaRyO BojayataH#} or--{#anyonyAM BojayataH;#}
{#anyonyamime brAhmaRakule BojayataH#} or--{#anyonyAM BojayataH;#}
these are the instances given by Patanjali on the Vārttika
12 to Pāṇ. VIII. 1. 12, and because they show either word
as representing in meaning the accus. of {#anyonya,#} some
grammarians (‘of the East’, according to the Prauḍhama-
noramā on the same rule) contend that the option is re-
stricted to the meaning of this case, but that {#anyonyam#} alone
is admissible when expressing adverbially the sense of the
other cases. Others, on the contrary, maintain that the quoted
words are intended by Patanjali merely as an instance and
that the option extends also to sentences in which {#anyonyam#}
would imply the sense of an instrumental &c. Bhaṭṭoji, re-
ferring in the Siddh. Kaum. on the quoted rule to Patanjali's
gloss on the 5th Bhāṣyakārikā to Pāṇ. IV. 1. 3, sides with
the former opinion. (Prauḍham. {#yadapi tftIyAdizu puMvaditi#}
{#prAco granTaM vyAcakzARA AhuH . tftIyAdizu puMvadBAvaviSezaH .#}
{#tena wAp na . atra tftIyAdizvavivakzitam . dvitIyAyAmapi puM-#}
[Page148-b+ 56]
{#vattvasyezwatvAditi . taccintyam . puMvattvaM viSeza iti viSezABiDA-#}
{#namavivakzitamiti ca svokteH . parasparavyADAt . mUlakftA puMva-#}
{#dBAvasyAspfzwatvAt . tadgranTasyAYjasyenEva vyAKyAtatvAcceti dik ..#});
Jayamangala, however (in the printed ed. of the Bhaṭṭikāvya)
differs materially from either of the quoted authorities; for in
his comment on Bhaṭṭik. 8. 6. he not merely quotes apparently
a Vārttika which varies in important points from that of Pa-
tanjali, but justifies {#anyonyam#} of the text by adding: {#strInapuM-#}
{#sakayorAmaBAva iti vaktavyam#} ‘if the subject is a feminine or a
neuter, the form {#anyonyAm#} is not admissible’ (the subject of
the commented sentence being {#udanvAn#} and the femin. {#rA-#}
{#kzasI#}); yet the correctness of the printed text alluded to is
very doubtful; for the E. I. H. Ms. 544 reads this comm. thus:
{#anyonyamityAdi . anyonyamityasyetyarTaH . karmavyatIhAre sarvanA-#}
{#mnI dvirBavataH . samAsavacca bahulam . yadA samAsavattadA pUrvapa-#}
{#dasya praTamEkavacanam . uttarapadasyAmBAva iti vAcyam . anyo-#}
{#nyasaMbanDiBiH SabdEH#} &c. &c. (Comp. also the comm. on Bhaṭṭ.
1. 21.)--As regards the classical literature there can be no
doubt that the adverbial use of {#anyonyam#} prevails almost ex-
clusively over that of {#anyonyAm#}. <sup>e.</sup> The Gaṇaratnamaho-
dadhi (which mentions {#anyonya#} among the {#sarvanAman#} q. v.) gives
{#anyonyasya#} in the Gaṇa {#cAdi,#} imparting to the genitive the
value of an adverb or that of {#anyonyam;#} but the instance,
Vardhamāna gives in his comm. on this work, {#‘anyonyasya#}
{#smaranti’#} is not happy, as the genitive could be the legitimate
government of {#smaranti; ‘anyonyasya Bojayanti’,#} the instance
of the Kāśikā to Pāṇ. VIII. 1. 12. Vārtt. 11; {#‘anyonyasya vya-#}
{#tipunanti’#} of Patanjali to Pāṇ. III. 1. 16. and {#‘anyonyasya#}
{#vyatilunanti’#} of the Kāś. to the same rule, seem more to the
purpose; but the occurence of the genitive in the sense of
other cases is, in general, rare.--Comp. {#itaretara#} and {#paraspara#}.
<div n="P">2. n. ({#-nyam#}) (In Rhetoric.) An {#alaMkAra#} q. v. or mode
of elegant expression; viz. conveying the mutual relation
or intimacy of two objects by representing them as the
mutual cause of the same action ({#‘arTayorekakriyAmuKena#}
{#parasparaM kAraRatve satyanyonyaM nAmAlaMkAraH’#}), e. g. ‘she shineth
through thee and thou shinest through her, like as the
moon shineth through the night and the night shineth through
the moon’. E. {#anyas#} and {#anya#}. [The oldest grammatical
authorities do not consider {#anyonya#} as a compound, but
take {#anyonyena#} and other cases as consisting of the two dis-
tinct words: the nomin. of {#anya#} and the instrum. of {#anya#}
&c.; see Vārtt. 11 to Pāṇ. VIII. 1. 12. and the remark of
Kaiyyaṭa: {#tatra bahulagrahaRAdanyonyaSabde samAsavadBAvABAvA-#}
{#tsubluNga Bavati . nApi samAsAntodAttatvamityAmreqitAnudA-#}
{#ttatvaM Bavati#} (comp. Pāṇ. VIII. 1. 3); but it results from the
foregoing statement that this etym. cannot be entertained.
Jayamangala on the Bhaṭṭikāvya 17. 8. appears to consider
{#anyonya#} not as a Tatpur., but as Karmadh. (in explaining
{#anyonyam#} by {#‘anyasya anyasya’#}), probably in thinking of Pāṇ.
VIII. 1. 11. which applies to VIII. 1. 12; but the possibility
of this application is removed by the quoted words of
Kaiyyaṭa and by the general remark he appends to the
Vārttikas of VIII. 1. 12, viz. {#vArtikezu karmaDArayavaditi na#}
{#saMbaDyata iti sublopAdi na Bavati#}. A modern theory takes
{#anyonya#} for a compound (it does not say which), but calls
[Page149-a+ 56]
the former part of this word a ‘benumbed’ nominative. It
seems, however, that the sense and accent of the word (it is
udātta on the second syllable) decide in the first place for
its being a Tatpur., and secondly its form, that it belongs
to that class of compounds in which the former part has
received a further developement by means of an affix {#s,#}
the function of which {#s#} apparently consists in producing a
stronger relation between the two parts of the compound and
consequently a more intense unity of notion, than would be
expressed without this {#s;#} comp. e. g. the derivatives of
{#sam-kf#} and {#saMs-kf, pari-kf#} and {#pariz-kf, apa-kF#} and {#apas-#}
{#kF; A-carya#} and {#AS-carya, apa-kara#} and {#apas-kara#} &c. and
such words as {#hariS-candra, ajas-tunda, bfhas-pati, prAyaS-#}
{#citti#} &c. &c. (comp. Pāṇ. VI. 1. 135-157.) which resemble closely
in formation {#anyo'nya#} (and the synon. {#paraspara#}); the accent of
this word would then fall under the category of Pāṇ. VI. 2. 2.]
