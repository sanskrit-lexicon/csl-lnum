{#anvac#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-nvaN-nUcI-nvak; nvaYcam-nUcIm-nvak;#}
{#nUcA-nUcyA-nUcA#} &c.; du. {#nvaYcO-nUcyO-nUcI;#} plur. {#-nvaYcaH-nUcyaH#}
{#-nvaYci; nUcaH-nUcIH-nvaYci#} &c.) <sup>1</sup> Following; {#anUci#} (loc. sing.),
behind, from behind; e. g. {#AgacCato'nUci gajasya GaRwayoH#}
{#svanaM samAkarRya samAkulANganAH#} &c. (comm. {#anUci pfzWadeSe#}).
<sup>2</sup> (ved.) Going along or lengthwise; as opposed to {#udac#} and
{#tiryac#} qq. vv.--The neuter {#anvak#} is used as adv. and as-
sumes in conjunction with {#BUtvA#} or in composition with {#BUya#}
and {#BAvam#} (see {#anvagBAvam#}) the meaning of ‘friendly or
favourably disposed’. [Pāṇini, in the rule III. 4. 64. makes
uses of the form {#anvaci#} which has the value there of a
locat. of {#anvac;#} Patanjali blames him for this liberty: {#a-#}
{#yukto'yaM nirdeSaH . anUcIti Bavitavyam . sOtro'yaM nirdeSaH .#}.
But as Pāṇini expresses himself in a similar manner when
speaking of {#tiryac#} III. 4. 60. {#‘tiryacyapavarge’#}--when he in-
curs a like remark from Patanjali--, it is perhaps more
just to say that he did not intend to speak in these rules
of the declinable {#anvac#} and {#tiryac,#} but of their neuters
become indeclinable; and that, his method requiring in these
rules the locative of the mentioned words, {#anvaci#} and {#ti-#}
{#ryaci#} were less objectionable than {#anvaki#} and {#tiryaki,#} while
{#anUci#} and {#tiraSci,#} as suggested by Patanjali, would not
have necessarily conveyed the notion of indeclinable words.]
E. {#ac#} with {#anu,#} kṛt aff. {#kvin#}.
