{#atityad#}Â¦ Tatpur. Beyond that. E. {#ati#} (sc. {#krAnta#}) and {#tyad#}
(in the sense of the accusative). This word seems to be
only one of grammatical coinage, to show that the declen-
sion of {#tyad#} in compositions like these is like that of other
nouns ending in {#d#} and not that of the pronominal theme
{#tyad;#} i. e. {#atityad, atityadO#} &c. (instead of {#atisyaH,#}
{#atityO#} &c.).
