{#antaHkaraRa#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-Ram#}) (In Philosophy.) <sup>1</sup> The interior
sense (also called {#AByantarakaraRa#}) opposed to the {#vAhyakaraRa#}
(q. v.) or exterior sense; this notion which in general may
be termed {%‘the faculty of thinking’%} is thus modified in the
Vedānta and in the Sāṅkhya: <sup>a</sup> (In the Vedānta it implies)
the notion of what is the general substratum of {#Atman#} or
Soul (Śaṅkara: {#taccAtmana upADiBUtamantaHkaraRam#}); its activity
becomes manifest in two of the seventeen {#sUkzmaSarIra#} (q. v.)
or subtle bodies of creation, viz. in the {#budDi#} (q. v.) or that
mental activity which forms positive conclusions, and in
the {#manas,#} or that mental activity which ‘discerns and doubts’;
[Page115-a+ 56]
and as {#citta#} or ‘logical combination’ is involved by the
activity of {#budDi,#} and {#ahaNkAra#} or ‘self-consciousness’ is in-
volved by {#manas,#} the activity of the {#antaHkaraRa#} is fourfold,
viz. as that of {#budDi, manas, citta#} and {#ahaNkAra#}. Śaṅkara in
his commentary on the Vedānta Sūtras varies slightly in this
respect by substituting {#vijYAna#} for {#ahaNkAra;#} the difference
however is merely apparent, {#vijYAna,#} worldly knowledge,
being also one of the attributes of {#manas#} (Śaṅkara: {#‘antaH-#}
{#karaRaM mano budDirvijYAnaM cittamiti cAnekaDA tatra tatrABi-#}
{#lapyate’#}). <sup>b.</sup> (In the Sāṅkhya it is not the substratum of {#puruza#}
or Soul but) the generic name and characteristic of three
successive productions of {#prakfti#} or Matter, viz. of {#budDi#} ‘as-
certainment or positive conclusion’, of its product {#ahaNkAra#}
self-consciousness’ and of the product of Ahaṅkāra, viz.
{#manas#} which in this philosophy means ‘an organ both of sen-
sation and of action’ (see {#budDIndriya#} and {#karmendriya#}), ‘the
organ of volition’ (see {#saNkalpa#}). ‘The ten external organs
(viz the five organs of sensation and the five of action)
supply the objects for the ‘interior sense’, their time is the
present time, while the interior sense embraces the past,
present and future time’. <sup>2</sup> (In the non-philosophical lite-
rature where philosophical terms are usually employed in
a vague manner, this word means) Mind, heart, feeling,
a synonyme of {#manas#} in its vague, unphilosophical sense;
e. g. (in a verse of the Mālatīmādhava where an apparent
show is made of philosophical accuracy) {#premArdrAH praRayaspf-#}
{#SaH…cezwA Baveyurmayi . yAsvantaHkaraRasya vAhyakaraRavyApA-#}
{#raroDIkzaRAdASaMsAparikalpitAsvapi BavatyAnandasAndrodayaH#}
(var. lect. {#°sAndro layaH#})--E. {#antar#} and {#karaRa#}.
