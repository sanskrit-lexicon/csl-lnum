{#BUdBavAn#}). E. According to the quoted commentators it
would seem as if they looked upon {#aByavadAnya#} not as a
compound but as representing two distinct words {#aBi#} and
[Page310-b+ 56]
{#a#} (neg.)--{#vadAnya,#} since the negative {#a#} could otherwise
not have been recognized by them, in conformity with
grammar, between {#aBi#} and {#vadAnya#}. Whether this division
of the word has taken place in the {%Bṛhadār.,%} it is pro-
bably not possible to say; in the {%Śatap.,%} however, the ac-
cent shows that {#aByavadAnya#} is {%one%} compound base. But as
{#aBi#} imparts sometimes a negative sense (‘away’) to the
latter part of a compound of which it is a former part
(comp. {#aByaya, aBiharaRa#} &c.), it is more plausible per-
haps to take {#avadAnya#} as another form of, and equivalent
in meaning to the shorter and probably older {#vadAnya#} (from
{#vadAna = avadAna#}), and to analyze therefore: {#aBi#} and
{#avadAnya#}.
