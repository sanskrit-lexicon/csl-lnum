{#apAra#}¦ I. Tatpur. n. ({#-ram#}) 1. The opposite bank of a river;
the same as {#pAra;#} comp. also {#avAra#}. E. See s. v. {#pAra#}.
<div n="P">2. (In the Sāṅkhya philosophy.) <sup>1</sup> A technical term to
denote that kind of mental acquiescence or indifference which
arises from the reflection that sensual objects perish in con-
sequence of enjoyment and that there is a feeling of pain
or trouble when they perish; some call this kind of ac-
quiescence {#sunetra,#} and others {#pArapAra#} (the latter word writ-
ten thus in the Calc. ed. of the comm. of the {%Sāṅkhya-%}
{%pravachana%} and in the E. I. H. Ms. 2668; in {%Wilson'%}s ed.
of the {%Sāṅkhya-Kārikā%} {#pArApAra#}); it is among the nine
kinds of acquiescence or {#tuzwi#} (q. v.) one of the five called
{#vAhya#} or acquiescences relating to exterior objects. [{%Wilson%}
in his comment on the Kārikā (page 155) renders the literal
meaning of this word ‘shoreless’, taking it therefore as a
Bahuvr.; but it seems to me that the compound terms of
this category, enumerated s. v. {#anuttamAmBas,#} are all Tat-
pur., the simile inhering to these terms being taken from
the notion of ‘water’ or ‘opposite shore’, and the dif-
ferent mode in which the former is expressed ({#amBas, sa-#}
{#lila, oGa, vfzwi#}) as well as the qualification conveyed by
the former part of the compound terms ({#supAra, uttamAmBas#}
&c.) being intended to express the higher or lower degree
of the various acquiescences, none of which is conducive
to final emancipation; the literal meaning of {#apAra#} would
therefore be, in my opinion, ‘a bad or undesirable opposite
shore’. In the list of {%Gaurapāda%} which differs from that of
the other comm., the correctness of the term {#sunetra#} seems
to me, for the reasons given, doubtful, unless {#netra#} is to be
connected there with the sense of {#netrI#} ‘river’.] <sup>2</sup> The re-
verse of the technical Sāṅkhya term {#pAra,#} i. e. <sup>a.</sup> non-ac-
quiescence or not being indifferent through not reflecting
that pain or trouble arises from the {%preservation%} of sensual
objects when they have been acquired; or <sup>b.</sup> non-acquiescence
[Page188-b+ 56]
through not reflecting that {%acquiring%} sensual objects causes
trouble or pain; (the term {#pAra#} being used by {%Gaurapāda%}
in the former, by {%Vāchaspati, Vijnānāchārya%} &c. in the
latter sense); it is amongst the seventeen {#budDibaDa#} or ob-
structions of intellect one of the nine which are the converse
of the {#tuzwi#} or acquiescences. E. {#a#} 1. deter., 2. neg. and {#pAra#}.
<div n="P">II. Bahuvr. m. f. n. ({#-raH-rA-ram#}) Shoreless, unbounded,
boundless, illimitable. E. {#a#} priv. and {#pAra#}.
