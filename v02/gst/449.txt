taining Swarga or heaven. It is nitya or obligatory for
the complete performance of the Jyotiṣṭoma and so far
considered sometimes identical with it, while the other
six parts or Somasansthās of this sacrifice are considered
as kāmya and anitya, voluntary and supererogatory. (See
{#atyagnizwoma, ukTya, zoqaSin, atirAtra, aptoryAma#} and
{#vAjapeya#}.) The Agniṣṭoma consists of three distinct parts
or savanas, the prātaḥsavana with five, the mādhyandina-
savana with five and the tṛtīya-savana with two stotras.
<sup>2</sup> The name of the Sāman or Sāmaveda verse called Yajnā-
yajnīya (which begins with the words {#yajYAyajYA vo agnaye#} &c.
see Sāmaveda I. 1. 4. 1.), because it closes the ceremonies
of the Agniṣṭoma in the tṛtīya-savana. <sup>3</sup> The name of the
first day in the Sattra Pañchadaśarātra. <sup>5</sup> A proper name,
the son of the sixth Manu, Chākṣuṣa, by Naḍvalā, also
Agniṣṭubh. <sup>6</sup> A species of the Soma plant. E. {#agni#} and
