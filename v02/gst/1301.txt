{#atirAtra#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-traH#}) <sup>1</sup> The name of the fifth part or Soma-
sansthā of the Jyotiṣṭoma sacrifice, for the complete per-
formance of which, however, it is not considered nitya, es-
sential or obligatory but kāmya, voluntary, viz. if the sacri-
ficer institutes it for the sake of progeny, and therefore anitya,
not always taking place, supererogatory. (See {#agnizwoma#}.)
<sup>2</sup> The usual beginning and concluding part of those Ahargaṇa
sacrifices which are called Sattra (q. v.) and the beginning or
the concluding part of those which are called Ahīna (q. v.).
There are, however, exceptions to this rule, see f. i. {#paYcadaSa-#}
{#rAtra, kuRqapAyinAmayana#}. <sup>3</sup> The name of the Sāmaveda verse
which closes the ceremonies of the sacrifices mentioned before.
<sup>4</sup> A proper name, the son of Chākṣuṣa or the sixth Manu by
Nadvalā. E. {#ati#} (sc. {#krAntaH#}) and {#rAtri#} (in the sense of
the accusative), samāsānta aff. {#ac;#} properly meaning ‘last-
ing beyond a night’.
