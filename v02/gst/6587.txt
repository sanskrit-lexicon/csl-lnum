{#aBIra#}¦ Tatpur. 1. m. ({#-raH#}) A cowherd. ‘According to
Manu (X. 15.) the {%Abhīra%} is of mixed origin, the offspring
of a Brāhmaṇa father and a mother of the Ambashtha or
medical caste; but the {%Abhīras%} were a people, a pastoral
tribe, settled about the beginning of the Christian era, on
or near the lower course of the Indus on a tract known to
classical geographers, as the {%Abiria%} of Ptolemy, lying north
of the Sahyadri mountain and of Syrastrene. The {%Abhīras%}
of Saurāṣtra are mentioned in the Mahābhārata. From
their pastoral habits the name came to be generally applied
to the cowherds of Hindustan. In the spoken dialects of
upper India the word is corrupted to Ahīr, Uheer; in Ben-
gālī and Marāṭhī it is unchanged, occurring as Abhīr.’

547. 553. 592. 792. 855. 953. 956. &c.--The word as a
name of a people occurs in the Purāṇas ‘always conjoined
with the {%Śūdras,%} as if conterminous’ ({%Wilson'%}s {%Viṣṇu-P.%}
p. 195 n. 154).--The {%Sāhityadarpaṇa%} mentions the {%Abhīras%}
as assistants appointed in, or belonging to, the harem
(together with dwarfs, eunuchs, Kirātas or mountaineers,
Mlechchhas or barbarians, the mock-brother-in-law of a
king, i. e. the brother of his concubine, hump-backs, mutes
&c.: {#vAmanazaRqakirAtamlecCABIrAH SakArakubjAdyAH#}). The
same work, in defining the purposes for which Sanskṛt
and the Prākṛt-dialects are used in the dramatic dialogue,
appropriates the dialect of the Abhīras (which therefore is
not considered by the {%Sāh.%} as an Apabhranśa-dialect) to
cowherds and woodcutters; comp. {#ABIrI#} s. v. {#ABIra;#}
{#(ABIrezu taTABIrI…. ABIrI SAvarI cApi kAzWa-#}
{#pattropajIvizu);#} others hold the Abhīra-dialect as belonging
to the Apabhranśa, when it would be excluded from dra-
matic use. See {#apaBraMSa#} and {%Lassen'%}s {%Institutiones Linguae%}
{%Pracriticae.%}--(The word occurs usually in the form
{#ABIra;#} the dialect spoken by the Abhīras is {%always%} called
{#ABIrI,#} not {#aBIrI#}.)
<div n="P">2. n. (? {#-ram#}) The name of a {%Mātrāvṛtta%} or Prākṛt
[Page300-a+ 56]
metre, regulated by quantity; it consists of a stanza of
four lines with eleven {%mātrās%} in each line (the value of a
mātrā being a short syllable, and a long syllable equal to
two short), viz. each line being composed either of seven
mātrās and a Scolius (˘¯˘), or of a Dactylus (¯˘˘),
a Iambus (˘¯) and a Scolius, or of a Scolius, a Tri-
brachys (˘˘˘) and a Scolius. E. {#Ir#} with {#aBi,#} kṛt aff.
{#ac#} (according to several comm. of the {%Amarak.%}); but the
word is probably not of Sanskṛ4tic origin.
