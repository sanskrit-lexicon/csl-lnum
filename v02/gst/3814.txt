{#yantI Sabdasya SaktyantarAnantaritA SaktiraBiDA nAma#} ‘Abhi-
dhā is called that power of a word which conveys the
conventional meaning without being prevented (to do so)
by any other power which the word may have (viz. the {#lakzaRA#}
or {#vyaYjanA#})’. <sup>4</sup> Made to disappear, rendered invisible by
interposition, e. g. {#meGErantaritaH sUryaH;#} or {#parvAntarito raviH;#} or
{#kuqyAntaritAnupalabDerapratizeDaH#} ‘there is no contradiction (to
our theory of vision) because we do not perceive what is
made invisible by the interposition of a wall’. [Of com-

II. 1. 8., a denom. may be formed the past partic. of which
will have the appearance of being a compound with a
latter part {#antarita;#} such words however are not com-
pounds, since the affix {#ta#} belongs to the whole denomin.;
e. g. in {#suvarRajYAnaM prakArAntaritam#} ‘the rule of alligation
illustrated by another method’ or in {#KilatvajYAnaprakArAnta-#}
{#ritapadAnayanayoH karaRasUtram#} ‘a rule to discriminate impos-
sible cases and to solve the problem by another method (in
those cases which are possible)’, {#prakArAntarita#} is derived
from {#prakArAntari,#} denom. of {#prakAra-antara,#} kṛt aff. {#kta#}.]
<div n="P">2. n.(?) ({#-tam#}) (In Arithmetic.) The same as {#antara(?)#}.

{#antari#} (denom.), kṛt aff. {#kta#}.
<div n="P">II. Tatpur. 1. m. f. n. ({#-taH-tA-tam#}) Gone within, into,
e. g. {#nidrAntarita#} ‘gone into sleep’.
<div n="P">2. n.(?) ({#-tam#}) (In Architecture.) ‘One of the nine
kinds of mouldings, of a quadrangular form, which enter
into the composition of pedestals and bases; it has general-
ly the same altitude with the fillet but as much recession
as the {#AliNga,#} another kind of moulding, has projection
over it; both these mouldings are placed alternately to-
gether and when used, are always thus inseparably con-
nected (accord. to Rām Rāz). E. {#antar#} and {#ita#}.
