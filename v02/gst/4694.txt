{#apara#}¦ I. 1. m. f. n. (is {#sarvanAman#} q. v.--except as the latter part
of Dwandwa and Bahuvr. compounds in general, as the latter
part of Tatpur. the former part of which has the sense of an
instrum., optionally as the latter part of Bahuvr. which have
the sense of a region of the compass and as the latter part of
a Dwandwa in the nom. plur. m., optionally too in general in the
abl. and loc. sing. m. and n., and in the nom. plur. m.--sing.
nom. {#-raH-rA-ram,#} abl. {#-rasmAt#} or {#-rAt-rasyAH-rasmAt#} or
{#-rAt,#} dat. {#-rasmE-rasyE-rasmE,#} gen. {#-rasya-rasyAH-rasya,#} loc.
{#-rasmin#} or {#-re-rasyAm-rasmin#} or {#-re;#} plur. nom. {#-re#} or {#-rAH#}
{#-rAH-rARi,#} gen. {#-rezAm-rAsAm-rezAm#}). The converse of
{#pUrva#}. <sup>1</sup> Distant, remote; e. g. {#sa viSvAcIraBicazwe GftAcIra-#}
{#ntarA pUrvamaparaM ca ketum#} (comm.: {#pUrvamimaM lokamaparamamuM lokaM#}
{#ca#}); {#aparaM kUlam,#} the opposite shore (opposed to {#pUrvaM kUlam#}
the nearer i. e. this side of the shore). <sup>2</sup> Posterior, follow-
ing, later; e. g. {#prANmuhUrtAtpraBAte'haM BavizyAmi DruvaM suKI .#}
{#AgAmini tataH kAle yo dvitIyaH kzaRo'paraH . tatra jetuM#}
{#gamizyAmi tridaSendraM sahAmaram .; aparA saMDyA,#} the evening-
twilight (opposed to {#pUrvA saMDyA,#} the morning-twilight). In
this sense the word may be the first part of Karmadh. com-
pounds, e. g. {#aparapakza#} q. v.--{#aparam#} is used adv. in the sense
‘further, moreover’ to connect different sentences; for its
sense ‘in future’ see I. 3. 2. and compare {#aparI#}. Comp.
also {#pUrvApara#}. <sup>3</sup> Last, behind, in space and time; e. g.
{#kIrtitastriviDastveza#} (viz. {#saMyogaH#}) {#Adyo'nyatarakarmajaH . ta-#}
{#ToBayakriyAjanyo BavetsaMyogajo'paraH ..#}. In this sense it
[Page166-a+ 56]
may form with a noun depending on it in the genitive a
Tatpur. (not a Karmadh.) compound of which it is the
former part; e. g. {#aparakAya,#} the hind part of the body {#(=#}
{#aparaM kAyasya); apararAtra,#} the last part of the night; {#apa-#}
{#rAhla,#} the last part of the day qq. vv.; if the latter part of such
a compound is a name of a season and a derivative is formed
of it by means of a taddh. aff. which has a {#Y, R#} or {#k#}
as anubandha, the first syllable of this latter part receives
Vṛddhi, not that of {#apara;#} thus from {#aparavarzA,#} the last
part of the rainy season, comes {#aparavArzika#} (taddh. aff.
{#Wak#}); from {#aparahemanta#} comes {#aparahEmana#} (taddh. aff. {#aR#});
from {#aparanidAGa, aparanEdAGa#} (taddh. aff. {#aR#}) &c. qq. vv.
<sup>4</sup> Western (opp. to {#pUrva#} eastern); in this sense it may be
the first part of Karmadh. compounds, <sup>a.</sup> if the com-
pound expresses a conventional term (e. g. a proper name);
e. g. {#aparezukAmaSamI, aparapARinIya#} qq. vv.; such compounds
have the udātta accent on the third syllable, if the latter part
is the name of a village, a country, a legend, or the word
{#cAnarAwa,#} or if it implies the meaning pupil, being itself a
derivative of the name of a teacher; if the latter part of such
a compound is the name of a country--except {#madra#}--or that
of a village or town of an eastern country and a derivative
is formed of it by means of a taddh. aff. which has a {#Y, R#}
or {#k#} as anubandha, the first syllable of this latter part re-
ceives Vṛddhi, not that of {#apara,#} e. g. {#aparapAYcAlaka#} (from
{#aparapaYcAla,#} taddh. aff. {#vuY#})--but {#Aparamadra#} (from {#apara-#}
{#madra,#} taddh. aff. {#aY#})--, {#aparEzukAmaSama#} (from {#aparezukA-#}
{#maSamI,#} taddh. aff. {#aR#}), {#aparakArzRamfttika#} (from {#aparakf-#}
{#zRamfttikA,#} taddh. aff. {#aR#}) qq. vv. &c.; such derivatives
have the udātta accent on the third syllable; <sup>b.</sup> if a de-
rivative is to be made of such a compound by means of a
taddh. aff.; e. g. {#apara#} and {#SAlA#} become {#aparaSAlA,#} the
western hall, for the sake of deriving {#AparaSAla;#} or <sup>c.</sup> if
such a compound is to become the former part of a com-
pound; e. g. if {#apara#} and {#SAlA#} are to form a Bahuvr. with
{#priya (aparaSAlApriya);#} otherwise {#apara#} (western) is not al-
lowed to form a Karmadh. with another noun.--The in-
strum. {#apareRa#} q. v. (which however is considered by {%Pāṇ.%} as
a deriv. of {#apara#} by means of a taddh. aff. {#enap#}) governs in
the sense ‘western of’ and with the implied sense ‘not far,
near’ the accus. or genit., e. g. {#apareRa grAmam#} or {#grAmasya;#} it is
used then in the sense of the nom., viz. ‘the western region
which is near’, or in that of the locat., viz. ‘in the near west’.
[The notion ‘western’--as has been observed already by
{%Wilson%}--is derived from the meaning ‘behind’, as that of
{#pUrva#} ‘eastern’ from its meaning ‘before’; comp. Viṣṇup.
p. 219, note 7.] Comp. {#avara#}. <sup>5</sup> Other (in general), different,
opposed; used in this sense in the same manner as {#anya;#} e. g.
{#mAtaraM BrAtaraM jyezWaM kanizWamaparAnapi . parityajeta ko nvadya#} &c.;
also with a noun in the abl. (like other synonymes of {#anya#}),
‘different from’; e. g. {#yallABAnnAparo lABo yatsuKAnnAparaM su-#}
{#Kam . yajjYAnAnnAparaM jYAnaM tadbrahmetyavaDArayet;#} comp. also III.
When it occurs as opposed to ‘the one’ (the one…the
other) the correlative term is {#apara#} or {#eka, anya, kiMcit,#}
{#kiMcana;#} e. g. of two: {#cAturBOtikamityeke . ekaBOtikamityapare;#}
or {#SAKinaH kecidaDyazWurnyamANkzurapare'mbuDO;#} of three: {#saMceruH#}
[Page166-b+ 56]
{#sahasAH kecidasvanAH kecidAwizuH . saMyAmavanto yativanni-#}
{#gadAnapare'mucan;#} of four: {#kecinninindurnfpamapraSAntaM vicu-#}
{#kruSuH kecana sAsramuccEH . UcustaTAnye Baratasya mAyAM Dikkeka-#}
{#yImityaparo jagAda ..;#} of five: {#anye tvalaNGizuH SElAnguhA-#}
{#svanye nyalezata . kecidAsizata stabDA BayAtkecidaGUrRizuH . u-#}
{#datArizuramBoDiM vAnarAH setunApare ..#} &c.; (these combina-
tions of the correlative terms vary according to the authors,
but the last term is usually {#apara#}). Sometimes {#apara#} is also
opposed to {#sva#} ‘own’, when it assumes the sense of {%‘foreign,%}
{%not belonging to one's self’,%} e. g. {#samIhitaM tasya nAcetansve#}
{#na cApare#} (comm.: {#sve AtmIyAH…apare parakIyAH#}).--
In this sense (5.) the word may form Karmadh. compounds
of which it is the first part; e. g. {#aparapuruza, aparADyApaka#} q. v.
[In the Vedas the feminine occurs also in the form {#aparI#}
with the udātta on the last syllable, although {#apara#} is other-
wise udātta on the first syllable; e. g. {#utAparIByo maGavA#}
{#vi jigye;#} the present edition of Pāṇ. IV. 1. 30. notices this
fact, but represents {#aparI#} as udātta on the first syllable;
a Ms. of the Kāśikā (E. I. H. 2440) reads in this Sūtra in-
stead of {#aparI#} the word {#avarI,#} but the instance alleged in
this Ms. is rather of doubtful correctness: {#‘avarI kanyA ma-#}
{#GavA vi jigye . avareti BAzAyAm’#}. Comp. {%Ṛgv.%} I. 32. 13.
Patanjali gives no comment on this word, nor his com-
mentators.
<div n="P">2. m. ({#-raH#}) The hind foot of an elephant (scil. {#pAdaH#}).
<div n="P">3. n. f. <sup>1</sup> ({#-ram-rA#}) The hind quarter of an elephant.
<sup>2</sup> ({#-ram-rI#}) (ved.) Future time. [It may be doubtful
whether the word is not a masc. instead of a neuter in this
sense, since it occurs only in an oblique case, when the
dative {#aparAya#} is explained by {%Sāyaṇa%} with the ellipsis of
{#kAlaH = aparasminkAle#} ‘in future’, and the accus., which
is also used adverbially: ‘in future’, with the same ellipsis
(= {#aparasminkAle#}) or with that of {#dina#} (= {#aparasmindine#}).
In the femin. the ellipsis is a word meaning night, as {#rAtri#}.
In either gender the word is udātta on the last syllable; see
the remark under I. 1. 5.] Comp. {#aparaja#}.
<div n="P">4. f. ({#-rA#}) <sup>1</sup> The hind quarter of an elephant. <sup>2</sup> The
womb. <sup>3</sup> Suppressed menstruation in pregnancy. <sup>4</sup> The west;

<div n="P">II. Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-raH-rA-ram#}) The reverse of {#para#} ({%superior,%}
in its literal and figur. acceptations) and always contrasted
with it: <sup>1</sup> Inferior, subordinate; e. g. {#dve vidye veditavye iti ha#}

{#jurvedo sAmavedo'TarvavedaH SikzA kalpo vyAkaraRaM niruktaM Cando#}
{#jyotizamiti . aTa parA yayA tadakzaramaDigamyate#} ({%Śaṅkara:%}
{#parA ca paramAtmavidyA . aparA ca DarmADarmasADanatatPalavi-#}
{#zayA#}); comp. with this definition of the ‘superior and in-
ferior wisdom’ in the {%Muṇḍaka Upan.,%} the definition given
in the Viṣṇup. p. 494, where {%Wilson%} observes (note 9):
‘the first ({#parA#}) is knowledge of Parabrahman, of spirit
abstractly considered, perfect knowledge derived from ab-
straction, the second ({#aparA#}) is knowledge of Śābda-
brahman, of spirit as described and taught in the Vedas or
their supplementary branches’. In the same manner {#paraM#}
and {#aparaM brahma#} (of the {%Praśnopan.%}) are the ‘superior and
inferior’ i. e. the transcendental and the mundane Brahman,
[Page167-a+ 56]
the one indefinable and incomprehensible, the other the re-
verse.--In a passage of the {%Śvetāśv. Upan.%} {#brahma…#}
{#yasmAtparaM nAparamasti kiMcit,#} {%Śaṅkara%} explains {#aparam#}
{#= anyat,#} but it is more probable that the words mean:
‘than which there is nothing superior nor inferior’ and
merely express the incomparability of Brahman. <sup>2</sup> In the
{%Vaiśeṣika%} philosophy the two correlative terms {#para#} and {#apara#}
(superior and subordinate) express the notion of <sup>a.</sup> {%absolute%}
({#para#}) and {%relative%} ({#apara#}), when applied to the notion of
{#sAmAnya#} or {%generality%} ({%Bhāṣāp.%} {#sAmAnyaM dviviDaM proktaM paraM#}
{#cAparameva ca#}), {%absolute%} generality belonging to the notion ‘to
be’ or ‘existence’ in general as including the notion of sub-
stance, quality and action ({#dravyAditrikavfttistu sattA parata-#}
{#yocyate#}), and {%relative%} generality to the notion ‘genus’ ({#para-#}
{#BinnA ca yA jAtiH sEvAparatayocyate#}); the notion ‘genus’
again as including substances, qualities and actions being
{%absolute%} or {%relative%} (see the meaning b.) ({#dravyatvAdikajAtistu#}
{#parAparatayocyate#}); <sup>b.</sup> {%more comprehensive%} ({#para#}) and {%less com-%}
{%prehensive%} ({#apara#}), when applied to a substance (see {#dravya#});
thus earth, water, fire, wind and the organ of thinking
have amongst other qualities also that of {%comprehending%}
{%more%} or {%less%} matter ({#kzitirjalaM taTA tejaH pavano mana eva ca .#}
{#parAparatvamUrtatvakriyAvegASrayA amI;#} or {#parAparatvasaMKyAdyAH#}
{#paYca vegaSca mAnase#}); the eye seizes objects which amongst
others have the quality of being {%more%} or {%less comprehensive%}
({#viBAgasaMyogaparAparatvasnehadravatvaparimARayuktam…gfhlAti#}
{#cakzuH#}); {#parAparatva#} is therefore one of the {%material%} qualities
({#rUpaM rasaM sparSaganDO paratvamaparatvakam . dravo gurutvaM snehaSca vego#}
{#mUrtaguRA amI#}); <sup>c.</sup> {%more remote%} and {%less remote,%} when applied
<sup>aa.</sup> to the notion of {%space:%} i. e. {%far%} and {%near%} ({#dUratvamantikatvaM#}

{#mapekzya prayAgaH paraH . pAwaliputrAtkurukzetramapekzya prayAgo'para#}
{#iti#}), farness implying the idea of a more, and nearness
that of a less extended area in contact with the sun ({#paratvaM#}
--scil. {#dESikaM--sUryasaMyogaBUyastvajYAnato Bavet . aparatvaM#}
{#tadalpatvabudDitaH syAditIritam#}); <sup>bb.</sup> to the notion of {%time:%}

{#ni saMnikfzwabudDirutpadyate tatastAmapekzyApareRa kAlapradeSena saMyo-#}
{#gAdaparatvasyotpattiriti#}), old age implying the notion of
prior, young age that of posterior existence with regard to
the revolutions of the sun, i. e. the former implying the no-
tion of more and the latter of fewer such revolutions ({%Bhāṣāp.%}
