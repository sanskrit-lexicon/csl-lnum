{#anna#}¦ I. 1. m. f. n. ({#-nnaH-nnA-nnam#}) Eaten. [The use of this word,
as a past participle of {#ad,#} is restricted, according to He-
machandra's Dhātupārāyaṇa, to such passive constructions
[Page133-b+ 56]
as correspond with our use of a past partic.; but while
{#jagDa#} may be substituted for {#anna#} also in these cases,
{#jagDa#} alone is admissible when ‘eaten’ is used either sub-
stantively with a genitive depending on it or impersonally;
‘{#adyarTAcceti vADAre#} ({#ADAra#} is here equivalent to {#aDi-#}
{#karaRa#} of Pāṇ. III. 4. 76.) {#kte . idamezAM jagDam .. pakze karmaRi#}
{#kte . jagDamannam .. BAve . jagDamanena ..#}’.]
<div n="P">2. n. ({#-nnam#}) <sup>1</sup> Food in general, eatable or drinkable;
e. g. {#annaM pitfmanuzyeByo deyamapyanvahaM jalam#} (comm.: {#annagrahaRaM#}
{#sakalAdanIyapradarSanArTam#}); or {#annamizwaM havizyaM ca dadyAdakro-#}
{#Dano'tvaraH#} (comm.: {#annaM BakzyaBojyalehyacozyapeyAtmakaM paYca-#}
{#viDaM dfzwam#}); also elliptically, the eating of food, e. g. {#sarvA-#}
{#nnAnumatiSca prARAtyaye taddarSanAt;#} comp. also {#annakAla, anna-#}
{#pAnarakzA#} &c. In the post-vaidik literature, an exalted eulo-
gium of food as the supporter of creation is given e. g. in the
Anuśāsanaparvan of the Mahābhārata v. 3204--3251 and 5541
--5562; comp. also {#annada#}. <sup>2</sup> (In the Upanishads and the Vedānta
philos.) Food in a metaphysical or mystical sense, the essence
of the elementary creation, that of which the coarsest sheath
or the coarse body of the Supreme Soul (see {#annamayakoSa#}
and {#sTUlaSarIra#}) is framed: the lowest and therefore not
truest form in which Brahman (n.) or the Supreme Soul
(comp. {#annabrahman#}) manifests itself in its worldly and con-
scious existence ({#‘ye'nnaM brahmopAsate’; ‘annaM brahmetyeka Ahu-#}
{#stanna’;#} see also {#annaja#}). Compare besides {#prARa, manas, vi-#}
{#jYAna, Ananda#}. In this form the Supreme Soul is also called
{#vESvAnara, virAj, viSva#} and {#jAgrat#} qq. vv., e. g. {#annaM vE virAw;#}
or {#sEzA virAqdaSasaMKyA satyannaM cAnnAdinI ca#}. The process of
this manifestation is thus imagined in the Taittirīya Upanishad:
in the Supreme Soul originates æther, in æther air and so
on in each preceding element successively fire, water, earth,
herbs, food, from which comes semen and man; in food
originate, too, all other creatures living on this earth ({#‘a-#}
{#nnAdvE prajAH prajAyante yAH kASca pfTivIM SritAH . aTo'nnenEva#}
{#jIvanti . aTEnadapi yantyantataH . annaM hi BUtAnAM jyezWaM tasmA-#}
{#tsarvOzaDamucyate’#}). In the Vedānta the theory of this primi-
tive developement is more intricate; comp. s. v. {#annamayakoSa#}.
(In the Aitareya Upan. food is represented as a being of
organised form sprung forth from the heated waters, the
process of creation differing materially from that imagined
by the Taittirīya and the Vedānta.) <sup>3</sup> (The latter meaning
applied in the doctrine of the Viṣṇuites to) Viṣṇu. <sup>4</sup> (ved.)
Water. <sup>5</sup> Corn in general (comp. {#sarvOzaDa#} under meaning 2.).
<sup>6</sup> Boiled rice. [In the two last meanings {#anna#} is used also
as a term of contempt; when combined with {#man#} cl. 4. in
this sense, it depends on the latter in the accusative (not
in the dative as similar terms, e. g. {#tfRa, busa, Svan#} &c. also
may); e. g. {#na tvAnnaM manye yAvadBuktaM na SrAdDam#} ‘not so much
as a grain or a grain of boiled rice &c.’ (but {#na tvA tfRaM,#}
{#busaM, SvAnaM#} or {#tfRAya, busAya, Sune manye#}); for similar terms
comp. also {#nO, kAka, Suka, SfgAla#}.] <sup>7</sup> A soup or sauce made
of flesh; see {#annaprASana#}. <sup>8</sup> A soup or sauce made of rice; see
s. v. {#annamala#}. <sup>9</sup> Spirituous liquor made of rice; see s. v. {#annapeya#}
and {#annamala#}. E. {#ad,#} uṇ. aff. {#kta;#} the native gramm. assign
to {#anna#} in the meaning ‘boiled rice’, and probably also in
the other meanings, the uṇ. aff. {#na#} which is {#nit#}. The Tait-
[Page134-a+ 56]
tirīya-Upan. explains {#anna#} 2. 2. thus: {#adyate'tti ca BUtAni#}
{#tasmAdannaM taducyata iti .#} ‘because it is eaten and because it
eats what exists i. e. because what exists becomes again {#anna#}’.
<div n="P">II. m. ({#-nnaH#}) The sun. E. According to an Uṇṇādisūtra
as quoted in the Siddh. Kaum. and in Nṛsinha's Swara-
mañjarī {#at,#} uṇ. aff. {#na;#} acc. to Hemach.'s Dhātupārāyaṇa,
{#am (uRRAdO damyamIti ne . annaH),#} uṇ. aff. {#na#}.
