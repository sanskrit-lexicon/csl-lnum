{#antika#}¦ I. 1. m. f. n. ({#-kaH-kA-kam#}) Near, proximate. Comp.
{#anta, antara, antama, anti, antikatama, antitama, antiya,#}
{#antya#}.--The words {#nedIyas#} and {#nedizWa#} are considered
as the comparative and superl. of {#antika#}.--In the dramas
{#janAntikam#} ‘what is spoken apart to a person so that none else
may hear’ is opposed to {#svagatam#} ‘what is spoken to one's self’.
<div n="P">2. n. ({#-kam#}) Vicinity, neighbourhood. [{#antikAt#} forms
Tatpur. compounds with a following kṛt formation in {#kta#}
(i. e. with a past participle), e. g. {#antikAdAgata;#}--such
a word being a compound, because it has but one accent--;
{#antikam, antikena, antikAt#} and {#antike#} are, besides in
their literal acceptations, used like prepositions with a noun
following or preceding in the genit. or ablat.; e. g. {#antikaM#}
{#grAmasya#} or {#grAmAt#} ‘near a village’. The correctness of
the restriction enjoined by some grammarians, not to com-
bine the ablat. {#antikAt#} with a noun in the ablat., is de-
nied by Patanjali and his comm.; comp. the instance s. v.
{#dUra.--antikAt#} (lit. from the vicinity of) occurs also
in the sense of ‘from’, much in the same manner as the
ablat. {#sakASAt;#} e. g. {#krIRIyAdyastvapatyArTaM mAtApitroryama-#}
{#ntikAt . sa krItakaH#} &c.; or {#nAparADnIdiyaM kiMcidaBraSyatpatyu-#}
{#rantikAt#}. NB. Words like {#keSAntika, nAsAntika, grahaRA-#}
{#ntika, AmaraRAntika, prARAntika#} are not compounds of
{#keSa, nAsA#} &c. and {#antika,#} but deriv. with taddh. aff. {#Wan#}
of {#keSAnta, nAsAnta#} &c.] E. {#anta#} or {#anti,#} taddh. aff. {#Wan#}.
<div n="P">II. f. ({#-kA#}) A fire place, a furnace. Also {#antI#} and
{#andikA#}. E. The native comm. derive it from {#ant,#} kṛt
aff. {#Rvul#} ‘because it connects with itself the cooking uten-
sils’; but though a similar ellipsis is implied by its synon.
{#aDiSrayaRI,#} the same notion might be obtained by con-
necting its etym. with that of {#antika#}.
<div n="P">III. f. ({#-kA#}) The name of a plant (Echites scholaris),
a decoction of which is used for one of the urinary dis-
eases. E. Perhaps from {#anti#} II., denom. of {#anta,#} kṛt aff.

{#Rvul,#} the fem. of {#antaka;#} compare its synonyme {#SAtalA#}
(probably from the caus. of {#Sad#}).
<div n="P">IV. f. ({#-kA#}) (In theatrical language.) An elder sister,
the same as {#attikA#} of which it seems to be, like {#artikA,#}
a degenerated form.
