{#apsas#}¦ n. ({#-psaH#}) (ved.) The same as {#rUpa;#} esp. form, beauty.
E. {%Śākapūṇi,%} as quoted by {%Yāska,%} derives this word as a
Tatpur. from {#a#} neg. and {#psas#} ({#psA,#} probably uṇ. aff.
{#asun#}) and interprets it as meaning liter. ‘what ought to
be looked upon ({#AdarSanIya#})’ or ‘what ought to be diffused’
i. e. manifest to sight {#‘vyApanIyaM vA spazwaM darSanAya’;#} but in
the latter acceptation probably from {#ap#} (comp. the E. of
{#apta#}) and implying perhaps the meaning of {#Ipsita#}.
