{#atIva#}Â¦ Tatpur. ind. Much, very much, much indeed. (Some-
times {#atIva#} may be explained as representing the two
distinct words {#ati#} (the preposition) and {#iva#} which through
Sandhi form {#atIva#} but which are not then to be considered
as an inseparable Tatpur. compound.) E. {#ati#} and {#iva#}.
