{#aByavahArya#}¦ Tatpur. 1. m. f. n. ({#-ryaH-ryA-ryam#}) Fit to be taken
as food (solid or liquid); e. g. {%Vārtt.%} 1. to {%Pāṇ.%} VII. 3. 69.:
{#BojyamaByavahAryamiti vaktavyam,#} with which words {%Kātyāyana%}
criticizes {%Pāṇini%} for having either restricted the sense of
{#Bojya#} to that of {#Bakzya#} (‘fit to serve as solid food’) or used
{#Bakzya#} in the general acceptation of {#aByavahArya#}. {%Patanjali,%} it
[Page311-a+ 56]
is true, defends {%Pāṇini%} (as he frequently sides with {%Pāṇini%}
against the hypercriticisms of {%Kātyāyana%}) also on this oc-
casion by alleging {#abBakza#} and {#vAyuBakza#} in evidence that {#Bakz#}
(and, impliedly, that {#Bakzya#}) are used in a general sense;
but on another occasion when he shows that there are
words the bearing of which in the classical language can
merely be established from the context in which they occur
in the vaidik literature, and not be made out otherwise (see
{#ekapada#}), he gives these very instances as a proof of his
latter assertion, and admitting therefore that they belong to
this exceptional category, corroborates thus involuntarily
the view of {%Kātyāy.%} that {#Bakz#} cannot be applied to the word
{#ap#} in a {%general sense,%} and much less to any other word
having the sense of a liquid substance ({%Patanj. Introd.:%}

applied to {#ap,#} in the vaidik language, and as it seems
strange that {%Pāṇini%} should have erred in the use of so
common words as {#Bojya#} or {#Bakzya,#} it is possible also to ob-
tain another result from this discussion of {%Patanjali,%} which
would reconcile the observations he makes in his Introd.,
with those he has appended to the quoted Sūtra, a result
supported by many {%Sūtras%} of {%Pāṇini,%} viz. that {%Kātyāyana,%}
far from being a contemporary of {%Pāṇini,%} as is stated in
one of the ghost stories of the {%Kathāsaritsāgara,%} has lived,
on the contrary, at another period, and that many {%Vārttikas%}
of his must not be looked upon {%by us%} as impugning the ac-
curacy of {%Pāṇini'%}s rules at the time when this grammarian
wrote, but as commenting upon, extending and restricting
the validity of these rules at a probably much later period
of the Sanskṛt literature. See my Preface to the {%Mānava-%}
