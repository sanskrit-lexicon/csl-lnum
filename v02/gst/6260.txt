{#aBiyAtin#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-tI#}) The same as the preceding;
(according to {%Rāyamuk., Bharata%} &c. on the {%Amarak.%}). E.
(according to {%Rāyam.%}) {#yat#} with {#aBi,#} kṛt aff. {#Rini;#} but
it seems plausible to connect the E. of this word with that
of {#aBiyAti#} and to derive it from {#yA#} with {#aBi#} by an
aff. {#tin;#} comp. {#aBimAtin#}.
