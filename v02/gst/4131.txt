{#annamayakoSa#}¦ Karmadh. m. ({#-SaH#}) The sheath made of {#anna#} 2. 2.,
of the essence of the elementary creation, i. e. the material
creation: the lowest form in which Brahman (n.) or the
Supreme Soul is considered as manifesting itself in its world-
ly and conscious existence.--In the Taittirīya-Upan. {#anna#}
of which the material creation is made, is the product of
herbs, these of earth and so on in retrogression, of the
elements water, fire and æther, the latter being the first
product of the Supreme Soul; it would appear therefore
that Brahman (n.) as {#annamayakoSa,#} in this Upanishad,
[Page136-a+ 56]
is the totality of the {%animal kingdom%} only, since the vegetable
kingdom precedes the creation of {#anna#} which is called also
{#sarvOzaDa#} (see {#anna#} 2. 2.) and the beings ({#prajAH#} or {#BUtAni#})
originating in {#anna,#} are represented as {%living%} through it
({#‘aTo'nenEva jIvanti’#}); but as {#anna#} on the other hand,
is the essence of the elements preceding it, this form of
Brahman would become in the Upanishad, constructively,
the same that it is in the Vedānta explicitly, viz. the to-
tality of the whole material creation. Yet while the Upa-
nishad uses the terms æther, air, fire, water and earth to
denote the elements in a general sense, the Vedānta dis-
tinguishes between ideal ({#sUkzma#}) and real ({#sTUla#}) elements
and makes the {#annamayakoSa#} proceed from the latter which
are an artificial mutual combination of portions of the former
(see {#BUta, sUkzmaBUta#} and {#sTUlaBUta#}); and while the Upanishad
contents itself with the general idea of totality, as expressed
above, the Vedānta distinguishes between the conception
that may be formed of the Supreme Soul as unity in this
totality of the material creation (comp. {#samazwi#}) and the con-
ception that may be formed of it as multiplicity in it (comp.
{#vyazwi#}); as unity it is called {#vESvAnara#} or {#virAj,#} as multi-
plicity {#viSva,#} in either case it is {#jAgrat#}.--The forms superior
to the {#annamayakoSa#} are in successive gradation {#prARamayakoSa,#}
{#manomayakoSa, vijYAnamayakoSa#} and {#AnandamayakoSa#} qq. vv.
(the word {#koSa#} being supplied, in the Upanishad, by the
comm. to {#annamaya#} &c.). Compare also {#sUkzmaSarIra#} and {#sTU-#}
{#laSarIra#}. E. {#annamaya#} and {#koSa#}. Also written {#annamayakoza#}.
