according to {%Harisvāmin,%} on the first day of the second
or dark fortnight; acc. to the {%Sāmaveda-school,%} on the first
day of the first or light fortnight of the month Phālguna
(February-March); it consists of several ceremonies which
last five days, the first or {#dIkzA#} occupying one day, the
{#upasad#} offerings three days and the {#sutyA#} one day. The
officiating priest who performs the initiatory rites and
chants the Sāmav.-hymns specified in {%Maśaka'%}s {%Kalpasūtras,%}
must be a Brāhmaṇa of the family of {%Bhṛgu.%} The principal
ceremonies of this sacrifice (in which seem to have originated
those of the {#aBizeka#} q. v.) are the following: after the
initiatory rites have been performed and the {%Adhwaryu%}
priest has summoned the king who performs the Rājasūya
sacrifice, in proclaiming his name, the name of his father
and mother and that of his kingdom, he takes seventeen
kinds of liquid with vessels made of {%Udumbara%} (Ficus glo-
merata) wood, viz. he takes 1. water of the river Sarasvatī,
which he places in a well screened place; 2. having pro-
vided himself with as much clarified butter as is sufficient
for a full libation and gone into a pond, and having sent
there a man or a beast, he pours into the first wave which
is roused by either of them in an eastern direction, the
clarified butter and then takes the water of that wave; 3. he
repeats the same process with the second wave which is
roused in a western direction; 4. he then takes river-water
[Page288-a+ 56]
in the direction with the stream and 5. against the stream,
6. river-water which has broke out and formed a separate
stream, 7. sea-water, 8. water from a whirlpool, 9. water from
a deep lake, 10. water proceding from rain during sunshine,
before it has fallen down, 11. water from small tanks, 12. well-
water, 13. ice- or dew-water; ({%Śrīdeva%} observes that it must
be collected in places where there is much dry grass,
by throwing a clean garment over it and afterwards by
wringing it out in a cup); 14. honey, 15. water proceeding
from the membranes investing the fœtus of a cow which
has calved, 16. milk, 17. clarified butter; ({%Śrīdeva%} observes
that the water of the Sarasvatī and all water which is not
at hand as well as the water which can only be had con-
ditionally, e. g. that of 10. 13 15., must be first procured and
then the other kinds). He then catches, at it were, sun beams
with the hollow of his hand and joins them with each of the
seventeen liquids while repeating severally the hymns he
has recited before, when collecting each water. Then, he
pours these liquids into one vase made of {%Udumbara-%}
wood, arranges four vases made severally of {%Palāśa%}-(Butea
frondosa), {%Udumbara-,%} the pendant branch of the {%Ficus%}
{%Indica-,%} and {%Aśvattha-%} (Ficus religiosa) wood, spreads
out before them a tiger-skin and distributes the water col-
lected in the one vase, into the four sacrificial vases. Next
follows the toilet of the king who takes off the garments
he wore at the preparation for the sacrifice, and now is
clad by the Adhwaryu in a silk under garment and over
it in a red and white cloak; on his head the priest places
the royal turban ({%uṣṇīṣa%}), fastening both its ends to his
waist; and in his hands the bow, which he strings, and
three arrows. Then he throws copper into the face of a
long-haired eunuch who sits in the midst of the assembly and
represents the various kinds of death. These rites having been
performed, the Adhwaryu invites the king to step on the
tiger-skin, placing under his feet a golden circle and another
golden circle perforated with nine or a hundred holes on his
head; then he lifts up the arms of the king, and while the
latter is thus standing with his face towards the east, either he
or the royal family priest drops the contents of the Palāśa
vase over him; then the king's brother drops over him the
water contained in the Udumbara vase; then a Kshatriya
friend the water in the third vase, and lastly a Vaiśya
the water in the Aśvattha vase. The Hotṛ then having
recited the legend of Śunaḥśepa, the king gives to the
Adhwaryu and to him severally a hundred or a thousand
cows as well as gold, food and cloth; he then rubs the
consecrated water which remains on his body, over himself
with a black-horn-brush, makes three steps on the tiger-
skin at the hand of the Adhwaryu, and having poured the
remainder of the consecrated liquid into the Palāśa vase
hands it to his favourite son. After a libation of clarified
butter the Adhwaryu then proclaims the name of the king
coupling with it, however, this time the name of the son
(by saying e. g. ‘here is Daśaratha, the father of Rāma’).
The subsequent ceremonies refer to the preparation of a
carriage, the putting to it of a team of horses &c., the
[Page288-b+ 56]
giving of cows to the king's brother, the king's mounting
the car, tying on his feet a pair of shoes made of boar's
skin, giving to his bow-bearer the bow with the three ar-
rows and after various other rites, playing a game of shells,
five shells having been handed to him by the Adhwaryu,
with his brother, his charioteer ({%sūta%}) or his architect ({%stha-%}
{%pati%}) and his military chief, the shells being either made
of gold, or the fruits of Beleric myrobalan serving as such
({%Sāyaṇa%} on the {%Śatap.:%} {#akzA nAma kapardakAH suvarRanirmitAH .#}
{#viBItakaPalAni sOvarRA vetyeke#}) and the game representing
the victory of the Kali age over the other ages; the cere-
mony closes with libations in the fire. (The Mīmānsists
do not consider the recital of the legend of Śunaḥśepa and
the game of shells as special parts of the Abhiṣechanīya,
but as rites belonging in general to the whole Rājasūya
sacrifice. For the full detail of the ceremony and the
hymns to be recited at the various rites see {%Śatapathabr.%}
V. 3. 3. 1.--4. 4. 25. and {%Kātyāyana'%}s {%Śrautas.%} book 15,
4-7.). E. {#aBizecana,#} taddh. aff. {#Ca#} (II. 2. scil. {#somayAga#});
({%Mādhava,%} however, who uses also the term {#aBizecya#} as
the name of the ceremony, seems to consider the word as
a Tatpur. like {#aBizecanIya#} I.).
