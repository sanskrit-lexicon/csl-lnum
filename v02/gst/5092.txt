{#apAna#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-naH#}) <sup>1</sup> The air which goes downwards; in
the Vedas, in the doctrine of the Upanishads as well as in
the philosophical and medical systems, the air (comp. {#vAta,#}
{#vAyu#}) which is {%inhaled%} and {%descends%} the body, one of the
[Page186-a+ 56]
five vital airs which are supposed to pervade the latter; (op-
posed to {#prARa,#} the air which is {%exhaled%} or {%proceeds%} from the
body; comp. besides {#udAna, samAna, vyAna#} and see {#ana#}); in
the legend of the {%Aitareya Upan.%} it is therefore this vital air
which is able to seize food, (for it introduces it into the body),
and to give support to life; comp. {#annAyu#}. In the {%Śatapath.%}
and {%Bṛhadār. Upan.%} it is called, from the same reason, the
function of {%smelling%} (and the odour {%inhaled%}): {#prARo vE grahaH#}
{#so'pAnenAtigrAheRa gfhIto'pAnena hi ganDaM jiGrati#}. In the
{%Vedānta-Sāra%} it is defined: {#apAno nAmAvAggamanavAnpAyvA-#}
{#disTAnavartI#} (comm. {#aDo nABeraDastAdgamanavAnmalAdyAnayana-#}
{#vyApAreRa . pAyurgudam . tatsTAnavartItyarTaH . AdiSabdAdupasTagra-#}
{#haH . tatrApi mUtraretovisargasyApAnakarmatvAt#}); in the {%Sāṅkhya%} it
is like the other four vital airs the function which is common
to {#budDi, ahaNkAra#} and {#manas#} qq. vv. ({%Sāṅkhya prav.%} {#sAmAnyaka-#}
{#raRavfttiH prARAdyA vAyavaH paYca#}) and explained by the comm.
{#apanayanAdapAnastatra yatsyandanaM tadapi sAmAnyavfttirindriyasya#}.
In the {%Kaṇāda-Sūtra%} {#prARApAnanimezonmeza°°#} it is explained
as having the property of {#aDogamanaM PutkArAdO vA tiryagga-#}
{#manam#}. This theory is then more fully developed in {%Su-%}
{%śruta's Nidānasthāna%} where the {%inhaled vital air%} ‘resides in
the rectum and in time {%draws down%} the excrements, urine,
semen, fœtus and menses’ ({#pakvADAnAlayo'pAnaH kAle#}
{#karzati cApyayam . samIraRaH SakfnmUtraSukragarBArtavAnyaDaH#}), and
‘when obstructed by bile produces burning, heat and a little
blood, when obstructed by phlegm, heaviness in the lower
part of the body’ ({#apAne pittasaMyukte dAhOzRye syAdasfgda-#}
{#ram . aDaHkAye gurutvaM ca tasminneva kaPAvfte#}). Comp. also the
following from the musical work {%Saṅgītadarpaṇa:%} {#prARApA-#}
