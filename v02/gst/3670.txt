{#anta#}¦ I. m. ({#-ntaH#}) <sup>1</sup> End. <sup>2</sup> Term, termination; e. g. {#kUpAntaH#}
‘the bottom of a well’. <sup>3</sup> Limit, boundary, border. <sup>4</sup> A
place in general (comp. {#antara#}); e. g. {#vanAntaH#} (explained
as {#vanaBUmi#}) ‘a place in the forest, or the forest-ground’.
<sup>5</sup> Part, portion; e. g. {#ekAntA anubanDAH (‘ekAnta ityekadeSo#}
{#'vayava ityarTaH’)#} ‘anubandhas are essential portions of a word’
[Page114-b+ 56]
(comp. {#anekAnta#}); or {#aTavAyamantaSabdo'styevAvayavavAcI .#}
{#tadyaTA . vastrAnto vasanAnta iti,#} as Patanjali comments on
Pāṇini VIII. 4. 20. <sup>6</sup> End, completion; e. g. {#paSubanDAntamaDIte#}
‘he reads (the work) as far as and inclusive of the chapter
on the tying of the victim’; or {#svapnAnta#} Tatpur. ‘profound
sleep’, Bahuvr. ‘in profound sleep’. <sup>7</sup> End of life, death.
<sup>8</sup> End, separation (comp. {#antara#}); e. g. {#mEtreyIti hovAca#}
{#yAjYavalkya udyAsyanvA are'hamasmAtsTAnAdasmi . hanta te#}
{#'nayA kAtyAyanyAntaM karavARIti#} ‘o Maitreyī, quoth Yājna-
valkya, I am about to leave this place; hence with thy con-
sent I shall make a separation between (thee and my other
wife) the daughter of Kātyāyana’. <sup>9</sup> (In Grammar.) The
final letter of a word. <sup>10</sup> (In Grammar.) The last part of
a compound. <sup>11</sup> (In Grammar.) A pause. <sup>12</sup> Proximity,
vicinity; e. g. {#udakAntaM gataH;#} or {#AcAryasya vasedante#}. <sup>13</sup> Pre-
sence; e. g. {#jAyAyA ante nASnIyAt (= na BAryAdarSane'SnI-#}
{#yAt)#}. <sup>14</sup> Positive conclusion, ascertainment.
<div n="P">II. n. ({#-ntam#}) Nature, disposition, essence.
<div n="P">III. m. n. ({#-ntaH-ntam#}) <sup>1</sup> The last portion, the remainder;
compare {#antara#}. <sup>2</sup> Last; e. g. {#ante vayasi#} ‘in the last stage
of life’. [According to a comm. on the Amarak. {#anta#} ‘last’
remains masc. or neuter even when it is the attribute of a
feminine ({#‘strIviSezaRatve'pi strIliNgatAnizeDaH . tatra puMna-#}
{#puMsakaliNgatEva’#}).]
<div n="P">IV. m. f. n. ({#-ntaH-ntA-ntam#}) <sup>1</sup> Lowest, worst. <sup>2</sup> Last born,
youngest. <sup>3</sup> Near (compare {#antama#} and {#antika#}). <sup>4</sup> Handsome,
beautiful. (For this last meaning, given on the authority of
Viśva, the only instance--quoted also by the Śabda-
muktāmahārṇava--which has occurred to me, is that of
Māgha's Śiśupālabadha 4. 40. where the last part of the
compound {#vimalopalameKalAntAH#} is explained by the comm.
on the authority of the Śabdārṇava {#antAH = ramyAH;#} yet
as this meaning admits of no connexion with any of the
other meanings of {#anta,#} it seems preferable to analyze the
compound in {#°meKalA-AntAH,#} when {#Anta#} could be taken
as the participle (comp. Pāṇini VII. 2. 28.) of {#am ‘saMBaktO’#} in
the sense of {#Bakta#} ‘attached, served’; and this interpretation
is the more probable, as the verse in question exhibits a
permanent punning on words which either may be applied
to women or to objects of nature, and as {#Anta#} would then
correspond with {#Bajanti#} in the next line. E. {#am,#} uṇ. aff.
{#tan#} or according to others, from {#ant,#} kṛt aff. {#ac#} or {#GaY#}.
Both etym. are not satisfactory; perhaps the origin of {#anta#}
is in the elements of which the accus. plural is composed;
see the Preface.
