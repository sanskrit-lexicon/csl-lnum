{#apUraRI#}¦ Tatpur. f. ({#-RI#}) The silk cotton tree (Bombax
heptaphyllum). E. {#a#} compar. or explet. and {#pUraRI#}. (A
ludicrous and ungrammatical explanation which is given
of this word, viz. ‘not fit for the woof’, is simply refuted
by the circumstance that {#pUraRI#} means the same as {#apU-#}
{#raRI;#} the first part of the comp. is the explet. or compar.
{#a#} which occurs in {#apawI, anikzu, aneqamUka, akupya#} and
several other compounds.)
