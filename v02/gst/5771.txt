{#abjA#}¦ Tatpur. 1. m. ({#-bjAH#}) <sup>1</sup> Born or produced, in, or by,
water; a vaidik epithet of Fire (see {#ahi#} and comp. {#ap#}),
and of Āditya or the Sun in the type Dadhikrā, when he
is identified with Parabrahman or the universal deity, ac-
cording to {%Sāyaṇa,%} because the Sun is born in the midst
of the water; according to {%Mahīdhara,%} because he has
horses which are born from the waters, or as the Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa intimates, on account of the Sun's apparent ris-
ing from the ocean and setting in the same (see {%Wilson'%}s
{%Ṛgveda%} vol. 3, p. 200 note). <sup>2</sup> A lotus. <sup>3</sup> The moon.
<div n="P">2. f. ({#-bjAH#}) Lakṣmī or Śrī. [The last three meanings
are given by the {%Śabdaratnāvalī%} where the two E. I. H.
Mss., 1512 and 1585, refer the name of Śrī to the {%masc.;%}

both words {#abja#} and {#abjA#} are thus explained: {#abjaH SaNKe#}

{#trizu . klIvaM padme taTAbjAstu padmenduSrIzvasO pumAn;#} there
seems to be no incorrectness in the text of the Mss., for
{%Mathureśa%} takes now and then the liberties of a verse-
maker, but a male Śrī appears nevertheless to be a stronger
license even than a curtailed {#Danvantf#} (loc. {#Danvantari#}) instead
of {#Danvantari#} (loc. {#DanvantarO#}).] E. {#ap#} and {#jA#} ({#jan,#} kṛt aff. {#viw#}).
