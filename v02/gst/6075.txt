{#aBiniDAna#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-nam#}) <sup>1</sup> Placing over, putting over;
e. g. {%Kātyāy. Śrautas.:%} {#AyurasItyuttarayAjyasTAlIM saMspfSya pu-#}
{#rUravA ityaBiniDAnaM tayA;#} ({%comm.%} {#uttarAraRyA aDarAraRe-#}
{#rupari niDAnaM karoti#}). <sup>2</sup> (In the {%Prātiśakhyas%}) Suppression
or weakening of a sound with regard to, or on account
of, scil. the influence of a preceding or following sound
[the qualification {%‘with regard to’%} or {%‘on account of’%} seems
to be implied by the prefix {#aBi#}], viz. <sup>a.</sup> the suppression
of the vowel {#a#} through the influence of a {%preceding%} {#o#} or
{#e#} (comp. {#aBinihita#}); e. g. in {#gAhamAno'dayaH#} of the word
{#adayaH,#} or in {#vAle'vata#} of the word {#avata;#} <sup>b.</sup> the sup-
pression or weakening of the sound or of the vibration of
the voice which naturally follows the pronunciation of a
consonant, if such a consonant is {%followed%} by, and has made
{%sandhi%} with, another consonant; according to the {%Ṛgv.%}
{%Prātiś.,%} such a sound or the vibration of the voice is {%sup-%}
{%pressed,%} if the consonant is surd ({#ka, ca#} &c.); it is {%weakened,%}
if the consonant is sonant ({#ga, ja#} &c.) and the sound which
{%remains,%} after such weakening is called {#Druva#} (q. v.). This
suppression or weakening of the vibration of the voice,
however, takes place only under the following restrictions:
1. in the pronunciation of a {#sparSa#} or {#antaHsTA#} (except {#r#}),
[Page248-a+ 56]
if it is followed by a {#sparSa;#} e. g. in {#arvAgdevaH#} or in {#ulkAm;#}
2. of a {#sparSa,#} if it stands in a pause; e. g. in {#vAk;#} 3. of an
{#antaHsTA,#} if it is followed by another similar {#antaHsTA;#}
e. g. in {#tavvaM~H;#} 4 of {#l,#} if it is followed by an {#Uzman;#} e. g.
in {#SatavalSaH;#} 5. of {#k#} in {#akKyat;#} 6. of {#p#} in {#virapsI;#} 7. of
a {#sparSa#} except {#m#} (i. e. {#k#} till {#B#}), if it is followed by {#y,#}
{#r, v#} or an {#Uzman;#} e. g. in {#yadyat, tadrAsaBaH, yAnvaH, arvA-#}
{#kSaPO;#} (the latter cases 4-7. only in the theory of the {%Śā-%}
{%kalas%}). These general rules are subject to exceptions and
restrictions, and even as such they are not universally re-
cognized; {%Śaunaka,%} for instance, says, that {%Vyāĺi%} does not
recognize the {#aBiniDAna,#} {%in general,%} and admits of it only
when the following consonant is doubled or if a vowel or
{#r#} precede.--The {%Vājas. Prātiś.%} uses instead of the term
{#aBiniDAna#} the explanation {#sTAnakaraRavimokzaH#} ‘giving up
the characteristics of a consonant, viz. the organic dis-
tinction and the distinction with regard to the effort of pro-
nunciation’; (comp. the list in {%Pāṇ.%} I. 1. 9. where {#karaRa#}
answers the {#prayatna;#} and see {%Weber'%}s ed. of this {%Prātiś. Ind.%}
{%Stud.%} IV. p. 127), but applies it merely to the {#sparSa#} at the
end of a word, if it is followed by another word, and in
a pause.--The {%Atharvav. Prātiś.%} (quoted by {%Weber 1. c.,%}
where the {%masc.%} {#aBiniDAnaH#} seems to be an error of the
Berlin Ms.) admits the {#aBiniDAna#} only 1. of a {#sparSa,#} if it
is followed by a {#sparSa,#} 2. of a {#sparSa#} at the end of a word or
at an {#avagraha,#} 3. of {#l#} before an {#Uzman,#} 4 of {#N, Ra, na,#}
before {#h#}. {%Śākalya,%} in the cases 4-7. mentioned above, and
the {%Atharvav. Prātiś.%} in its enumeration do not consider
two consonants, the first of which suffers the {%abhinidhāna,%}
as {#saMyukta#} or combined consonants ({%Śaunaka:%} {#asaMyuktaM SA-#}
{#kalam;#} {%Atharvav. Pr.:%} {#ato'nyatsaMyuktam ‘saMyukta#} is a com-
bination of consonants other than that in the preceding
cases’); i. e. they assume such a stoppage of the voice as
to prevent two consonants to sound together; but {%Śaunaka%}
does not seem to go so far, for he quotes {%Śākalya%} apparently
for the sake of recording his dissent from the opinion of
the latter. The distinction is probably owing to the dif-
ference in the observation, by the different grammarians,
of the phenomena of pronunciation; the supposition of {%Mr.%}
{%Regnier%} ({%Journ. Asiat.%} 1857, p. 230), that there is a twofold
{%abhinidhāna,%} the one applying to the consonantic groups
which are the {%natural%} effect of the sandhi, the other to such
groups as are produced by the {%krama,%} is very ingenious,
but does not necessarily follow from the text of this {%Prātiś.%}
(I. 1. 6. and 7.); for similar differences of opinion in the theory
on the pronunciation of consonantic groups, arising ob-
viously from different observations, may be gathered also
from the Sūtras of Pāṇini. [In the preceding explanation
the term {#sparSa#} comprises the 25 consonants {#ka-Na, ca-Ya,#}
{#wa-Ra, ta-na#} and {#pa-ma;#} the term {#Uzman#} (q. v.) the sibi-
lants {#ha, Sa, za, sa;#} and the semivowels {#ya, ra, la, va#} are
termed {#antaHsTA,#} because their position in the system of
the vaidik gramm. is between the {#sparSa#} and {#Uzman;#} (s. v.
{#antaHsTA#} p. 117{%a,%} 1. 49 the words ‘vowels and consonants’
are a mistake for ‘{#sparSa#} and {#Uzman#}’).] E. {#DA#} with {#ni#} and
{#aBi,#} kṛt aff. {#lyuw#}.
