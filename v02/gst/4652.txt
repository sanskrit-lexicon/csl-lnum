{#apapitva#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-tvam#}) (ved.) Going away from, sever-
ance. E. {#Ap#} with {#apa,#} kṛt aff. {#tvan;#} (in analogy with
the etym. of {#sapitva#} as given by {%Sāyaṇa;%} but {%Benfey%}--s. v.
{#prapitva#} in his Glossary to the Sāmaveda--is probably more
correct in referring this and similar formations to a radical
{#ap#} (comp. the E. of {#apta#}). The compound is irregular on
account of the short vowel of the second syllable and belongs,
in this respect, to the class of {#karkanDu, SakanDu, sImanta#} &c.).
