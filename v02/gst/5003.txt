{#apasmAra#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-raH#}) (In Medicine.) Epilepsy, falling
sickness; according to {%Suśruta,%} of four kinds, the three
first produced by the derangement of air, bile and phlegm,
the fourth by the combination of the three. (A definition
of {%Ātreya%} is: {#pittaM raktaM marucCezmA udAnaH kupito BfSam .#}
{#prARaH Sirasi saMkupya kurute nazwacezwatAm#}.) In Rhetoric it is
mentioned as a {#vyaBicAriBAva#} or an accessory condition of
the Erotic ({#SfNgAra#}), Pathetic ({#karuRa#}), the Fearful ({#BayAnaka#})
and the Disgustful ({#bIBatma#}), and is defined--but happily
this definition has not guided the Hindu poets in the re-
presentation of their characters--as ‘dementation caused
by the planets or similar evil influences and causing falls,
trembling, perspiration, foaming at the mouth, slavering
&c.’. E. {#smf#} with {#apa,#} kṛt aff. {#GaY#}.
