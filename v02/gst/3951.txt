{#antAvasAyin#}¦ m. ({#-yI#}) <sup>1</sup> A Chāṇḍāla, a man of a Śūdra
father and Brāhmaṇī mother. <sup>2</sup> A barber. <sup>3</sup> The name
(probably a nickname) of a Muni. Comp. {#antyAvasAyin#}.
E. {#anta#} and {#avasAyin#} ({#so#} with {#ava,#} kṛt aff. {#Rini#}) acc.
to the native explanation ‘because he has the business of
finishing off the end sc. of the nails i. e. of paring them’;
but more probably ‘one who is engaged in the lowest (cf.
{#anta#} IV. I.) occupations’. This word is therefore not con-
nected with {#antevAsin#} q. v. An incorrect reading is {#antA-#}
{#vaSAyin#}.
