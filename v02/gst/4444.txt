{#anvAhArya#}¦ Tatpur. 1. m. ({#-ryaH#}) Rice which is given as a
present to the priests upon certain sacrificial occasions, as
at the performance of the Darśapūrṇamāsa; (presents there-
fore of a garment or of a calf are not an {#anvAhArya;#}) the
sacrificial acts must be, moreover, such as are connected
with the ritual of the Yajurveda ({#‘anvAhAryadakziRADvaryu-#}
{#vede’#}). Comp. {#anvAhAryapacana#}.
<div n="P">2. n. ({#-ryam#}) The monthly Śrāddha or funeral repast in
honour of the Manes, held on the day of the new moon;
it should consist of meat of an excellent quality and is so
called, because it is partaken after the presentation of a
piṇḍa to the Manes (comp. {#piRqAnvAhAryaka#}); according to
this definition of Manu, it would be the same as the {#pArvaRa#}
q. v.--others, as quoted by Bharatamalla on the Amarak.
s. v., define it as the monthly Śrāddha at the end of the
year, when the presentation of the piṇḍa has not taken
place ({#‘akftasapiRqIkaraRasya vatsarAnte pratimAsaM yacCrAdDaM#}
{#tatrAnvAhAryamiti kecit’#}). According to the Gṛhyasūtra
of Gobhila (as quoted by Rādhākāntadeva) it would be
<sup>a.</sup> the Śrāddha which is the preparatory act to any religious
ceremony, <sup>b.</sup> the second Śrāddha performed on the day of
the new moon, and <sup>c.</sup> the same as {#anvAhArya#} {%m.,%} but in the
more general sense of a present given at the end of any
sacrificial act: {#‘yacCrAdDaM karmaRAmAdO yA cAnte dakziRA Ba-#}
