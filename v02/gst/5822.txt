{#abrahmatA#}¦ f. ({#-tAM#}) (ved.) The condition of what is not endowed
with the bliss of wisdom, i. e. the condition of what is
perishable (according to {%Mahīdhara%}). E. {#abrahman,#} taddh.
aff. {#tal#} ({%Mahīdhara%} analyzes the word {#a#} neg. and {#brahmatA,#}
but he can be scarcely correct in doing so, as it is udātta
on the penultimate, not on the first syllable).
