{#anA#}Â¦ ind. (ved.) Certainly, indeed. (A commentator of the
Amarakosha considers this particle as a synonyme of the
negative {#na;#} his opinion rests, however, only on an arti-
ficial interpretation of the word {#anAvfzwi#} (q. v.) and is
refuted by others who explain it as derived, not from {#anA#}
and {#vfzwi,#} but from {#a#} neg. and {#Avfzwi#}.) E. unknown;
probably an obsolete third case of the pronominal theme
{#a#} (q. v.).
