{#antarAtman#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-tmA#}) <sup>1</sup> The Supreme Soul (comp.
{#paramAtman#} and {#puruza#}) as residing in the interior of man, as
the inward Spirit or individual Soul. In the Upanishads
the words {#puruza, Atman#} and {#antarAtman#} are often used
apparently as synonymes, but the term {#antarAtman#} is, more
especially, appropriated there to the notion of the Supreme
Soul when it resides, according to their doctrine, in the
interior of the heart, of a thumb's size ({#‘aNguzWamAtraH pu-#}
{#ruzo'ntarAtmA sadA janAnAM hfdaye saMnivizwaH’#}); [a devia-
tion, however, in this respect may be noticed in a passage
of the same Kaṭha-Upan. which contains also the preceding
quotation (viz. {#aNguzWamAtraH puruzo maDya Atmani tizWati#})
where {#puruzaH#} seems to have been considered as distinct
from {#Atman#} and not residing in the heart, although Śan-
kara endeavours to effect a reconciliation with the general
doctrine by interpreting {#Atman#} in that passage by {#SarIra#}].
--In the Vedānta the notion of the {#antarAtman#} has passed
into that of the {#jIvAtman#} q. v. In the other philosophies
the terms {#Atman#} and {#puruza,#} in the sense they assume in these
phil., have superseded the term {#antarAtman#}.--Manu uses
the word {#antarAtman#} sometimes in the general sense of {#A-#}
{#tman,#} sometimes in the special sense of {#jIvAtman#} (e. g. {#jI-#}
{#vasaMjYo'ntarAtmAnyaH sahajaH sarvadehinAm#}); Yājnavalkya, how-
ever, employs the terms {#Atman#} and {#antarAtman#} as syno-
nymes to denote the Universal Soul, while he associates
with {#puruza#} the idea of the manifested or individual Soul ({#a-#}
