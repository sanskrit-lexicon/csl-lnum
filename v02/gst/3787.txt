{#antarAtmezwakam#}¦ Avyayībh. (In ritual liter.) Between one's
own self and the bricks, i. e. between the pot ({#uKA#}) that
contains the impurities of a sacrificer, symbolically repre-
senting his sins, and the sacrificial bricks consecrated to
Nirṛti, which are supposed to possess the power of re-
moving them. E. {#antar#} and the Dwandwa {#Atman-izwakA#}.
