II. {#apa#}¦ m. ({#-paH#}) A sea, an ocean. E. {#ap#} taddh. aff. {#ac#}.
[Word and meaning are very doubtful; they are given on
the authority of Rāyamukuṭa, who interprets the word {#a-#}
{#pagA#} in the Amarakosha: {#ApaH santyatreti arSaAdyaci apaH#}
{#samudraH taM gacCatIti;#} comp. the E. of {#apagA#}. Comp. also {#apavat#}.
--For beginners it is useful to observe that in compounds like
{#SuzkApa, vimalApa#} &c., the latter part is not {#apa,#} but that such
compounds are to be analyzed into {#Suzka#} and {#ap, vimala#}
and {#ap#} &c., the whole word receiving the samās. aff. {#a#}.]
