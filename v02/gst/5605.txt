{#aprARin#}¦ Tatpur. m. f. n. ({#-RI-RinI-Ri#}) Inanimate, lifeless;
e. g. in {%Manu:%} {#aprARiBiryatkriyate talloke dyUtamucyate#}. (As in
{%Pāṇini'%}s {%Sūtras%} the neg. {#a#} is sometimes used in compo-
sition with a noun, when in ordinary writing it would be
more correct to employ the uncompounded {#na,#} as referring
to the verb of the sentence, the interpretation of the word
{#aprARizu#} in VIII. 3. 72. and therefore the bearing of the
rule itself becomes doubtful; the {%Kāśikā%} takes the Sūtra as
if it ended: {#na prARizu;#} {%Patanjali%} is less positive, for he ex-
claims, after showing the possibility of either acceptation:
{#kiM punaratrArTasatattvam . devA etajjYAtumarhanti;#} but {%Kaiyyaṭa%}
seems to think that if the gods {%must%} know it, the Paṇḍits may
have at least an opinion on the matter, viz. that {#aprARizu#} is
not to be taken there in the sense of {#na prARizu,#} as the unity
of the Sūtra would become disturbed by such an interpre-
tation: {#devA iti . paRqitAH paryudAsaM manyante . saMBavatyekavA-#}
{#kyatve vAkyaBedASrayaRasyAyuktatvAt . prasajyapratizeDe hi vAkyaBe-#}
{#do'vaSyaMBAvI;#} this latter view is also taken by {%Bhaṭṭojid.%})
E. {#a#} neg. and {#prARin#}.
