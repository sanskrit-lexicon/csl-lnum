{#apAlaNka#}¦ Tatpur. (?) m. ({#-NkaH#}) A plant (Cassia fistula).--
The word is udātta on the last syllable. E.? (The {%Sid-%}
{%dhāntakaum.%} in its chapter, the {#PiwsUtra,#} gives the word
only in its crude form, whence the masc. gender could not
be established; in the E. I. H. Ms. No. 98 of these Sūtras
the comm. writes once {#apAlaNkA#} and another time {#apAlaNkaH,#}
the latter being probably the correct form, to judge from the
synonymes and the form {#pAlaNka#} which seems kindred to it.)
