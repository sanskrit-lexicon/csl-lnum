{#antarIkza#}¦ Tatpur. 1. n. ({#-kzam#}) <sup>1</sup> The intermediate region,
viz. the region between earth ({#kziti, BU#} or {#pfTivI#}) and
heaven ({#dyu, dyo#} or {#svar#}); also called {#Buvar;#} the æther or
atmosphere between both: these three regions or worlds
being, in the vaidik belief, the residences of the three pri-
mitive deities, viz Earth of Agni (Fire), Atmosphere of
Vāyu (Wind) and Heaven of Sūrya (Sun). [{#antarikza#} is
the ritual name of the following verses of the Sāmaveda:
1. 239 (= I. 3. 1. 5. 7), 2. 206. 207 (= II. 2. 2. 9, 1. 2), 2. 212. 213 (=
II. 2. 2. 11), 2. 902. 903 (= II. 7. 2. 7), 2. 1039. 1040 (= II. 8. 2. 12);
{#antarikzasya lokavratam#} of 1. 169 (= I. 2. 2. 3. 5); {#antarikzasya#}
{#sarpam#} of the first half of 1. 270 (= I. 3. 2. 3. 8. a.)] <sup>2</sup> Talc
({#aBraka#}). <sup>3</sup> (In Arithmetic.) A cypher.--Also written
{#antarikza#} and {#AntarIkza#}.
<div n="P">2. m. ({#-kzaH#}) <sup>1</sup> The name of one of the great Ṛṣis who
in the present Manwantara have arranged the Vedas, the
Vyāsa of the thirteenth Dvāpara age. <sup>2</sup> A king of the
family of Ikṣvāku, a son of Kinnara and father of Su-
varna. E. {%Yāska%} explains {#antarikza#} amongst others as
{#SarIrezvantarakzayam#} ‘because it resides in the bodies’ and de-
rives it therefore from {#antari#} (a locat. of {#antar#}) and {#kza#}
(from {#kzi#}), considering thus {#antarikza#} as the primitive
and {#antarIkza#} as the later form. {%The comm. of the Amarak.%}
explain {#antarIkza#} as {#‘antarIkzyate jagadasmin’,#} and {%Sāyaṇa%}
as {#‘dyAvApfTivyormaDya IkzyamARaM vyoma’,#} the former deriving
it from {#Ikz#} with {#antar,#} kṛt aff. {#GaY#} and taking {#antarikza#}
as the vaidik and secondary form ({#‘vede tu CAndasaM hrasvatvam’#}).
The {%Śatapathabr.%} by describing {#‘imAvagre lokAvAsatustayorvi-#}
{#yatoryo'ntareRAkASa AsIttadantarikzamaBavadIkzaM hEtannAma tataH#}
{#purAntarA vA idamIkzamaBUditi tasmAdantarikzam’#} takes also
[Page123-a+ 56]
{#antarIkza#} as the primitive form and identifies {#antarIkza#} with
{#antarAkASa ‘AkASa#} being called {#Ikza’#}. The latter etym.
which coincides in some respect with that of Sāyaṇa &c.
has the most probability from the circumstance that the
rad. {#Ikz,#} of which {#Ikza#} would be a deriv., has all the ap-
pearances of a non-primitive radical (comp. {#Bikz, yakz,#}
{#Sikz#} from {#Baj, yaj, SAs#}) and of having arisen from
{#kAS,#} pref. {#A (AkAS),#} while the elision and change
of {#A#} to {#I,#} in the latter, would have its analogies in the
change of {#a#} and {#A#} to {#I#} under the influence of a final
sibilant and an elision in the interior of the word, in {#Ips,#}
{#jYIps#} &c. from {#Ap,#} the caus. of {#jYA#} &c.
