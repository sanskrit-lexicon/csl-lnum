{#aBojyAnna#}¦ Bahuvr. m. f. n. ({#-nnaH-nnA-nnam#}) One whose food
must not be eaten (because eating it makes impure or brings
misfortune); e. g. {%Manu:%} {#ya ete#} (those mentioned in the
preceding verses) {#'nye tvaBojyAnnAH kramaSaH parikIrtitAH .#}
{#tezAM tvagasTiromARi vadantyannaM manIziRaH#} ‘…their food, the
wise say, is (like) skin, bones and hair’. Such persons
are, for instance, an insane man, a wrathful person, a
thief, a public singer, a carpenter, a eunuch, a woman in
her courses or in childbed, a backbiter, a tailor, a black-
smith, a physician, a libidinous woman, a usurer &c.; see
{%Manu%} 4. 205-221.; {%Yājnav.%} 1. 160-168.--One who has un-
knowingly eaten the food of such persons must fast during
three days; but, having eaten it knowingly he must per-
form the penance called {%Kṛṣchhra,%} as if he had tasted
seminal impurity, ordure or urine; according to {%Manu%} 4. 222.
In another verse, however, {%Manu%} (11. 152.) is satisfied, if
such a sinner drinks barley gruel for seven days and nights
[Page305-b+ 56]
(see the quot. s. v. {#aBojya#}). Comp. {%Raghunand.%} I. p. 317 ff.
