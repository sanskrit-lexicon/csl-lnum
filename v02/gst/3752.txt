{#antar#}¦ ind. (see {#nipAta, gati, upasarga#}). A particle implying
<sup>1</sup> within, in the middle, <sup>2</sup> between, <sup>3</sup> under, in its literal and
metaphorical acceptations. It is used either adverbially or as
a separable preposition or as a prefix to verbs and occurs
also, but seldom, in the sense of a noun. With nouns, if
preceding them it may form Tatpur., Bahuvr. and Avyayībh.,
if following them indecl. Tatpur. compounds. It means:
<div n="P">I. (if used adverbially) <sup>1</sup> In the middle, within; mostly
followed or preceded by a noun in the locat.; e. g. {#apsvanta-#}
{#ramftam#}. <sup>2</sup> In the interior (said of a kingdom &c.); e. g.
{#laGuvfttitayA BidAM gataM vahirantaSca#}--comm. {#vahirmitrAdi-#}
{#janapadezu . antaramAtyAdizu--nfpasya maRqalam . aBiBUya#}
{#haratyanantaraH#} &c.). <sup>3</sup> In the mind, in the heart, e. g. {#aByu-#}
{#dayAnantarasAvaDita mudA nEzaDapriyAnantarasA#}. <sup>4</sup> By way of
[Page118-b+ 56]
enclosing or seizing, e. g. {#antarhatvA mUzikAM Syeno gataH#}
(comm. = {#parigfhya#}); comp. III. 1. [This meaning is meant
by the native Koshas when they render {#antar#} by {#svI-#}
{#kAre,#} for the Kaśikā interprets Pāṇini I. 4. 65. {#‘parigrahaH#}
{#svIkaraRam’;#} Mathureśa has probably misunderstood the
bearing of {#svIkaraRa#} when substituting for the latter word
the interpretation {#aNgIkftO#}.]
<div n="P">II. (as a separable preposition) <sup>1</sup> Within, <sup>2</sup> Between;
followed or preceded <sup>a.</sup> by the genitive, e. g. {#tasmAnnAkzyA-#}
{#dityayorantaH parameSvaraH;#} or {#hiraRmayyoH kuSyorantaravahita Asa;#}
<sup>b.</sup> (ved.) by the accus., e. g. {#rodasI antarurvI#}.
<div n="P">III. (as a prefix to verbs) <sup>1</sup> In the middle, between, e. g.
{#antarhatya#} ‘having struck in the middle’; compare on the
contrary {#antarhatvA#} 1. 3. <sup>2</sup> Under (implying disappearance);
e. g. {#DA#} with {#antar#} to hide, to make invisible, comp. also
{#antarDi, antarDA#} &c. [The intimate relation between {#antar#}
and the radical or verb in the latter cases is indicated not
only by the influence this particle exercises on the meaning
of the radical and its derivatives, but also by the effect it
has on the formation of the gerund (comp. {#antarhatvA#} I. 4.
and {#antarhatya#} III. 1.) and by the change it may produce in
the dental {#n#} of the radical and its derivation affixes, comp.
e. g. {#antarayaRa, antarhaRana#} &c.]
<div n="P">IV. (as an indeclinable noun) <sup>1</sup> The interior, any thing
not belonging to the exterior world, e. g. {#antarvahiriti#}
{#kAryadravyasya kAraRAntaravacanAdakArye tadaBAvaH;#} or {#Buvo'nta-#}
{#rUrDvamaDaSca#}. <sup>2</sup> The heart, e. g. {#rAkzama Bakza mAM…antaradAm#}
{#(= hfdayaM dattavatI)#}. Compare also {#antarvat#} and {#antarA#}.
<div n="P">V. (in composition with nouns) In the middle of, in the in-
terior of, in the heart of; <sup>1</sup> before the noun: <sup>a.</sup> in Tatpur., e.
g. {#antarja, antarduzwa;#} in several comp. of this class, it may
seem as if the latter part depended on {#antar#} in the genitive,
e. g. {#antaHSarIra#} the interior of the body, {#antarhfdaya#} the
interior of the heart, but it is more correct to consider
these interpretations as arising from such as ‘the body
in its interior &c.’; comp. several comp. beginning with
{#agra,#} e. g. {#agranaKa, agrahasta#} &c.; the {#n#} is changed to
{#Ra#} in the Tatpur. {#antarvaRa#} and {#antarayaRa#} qq. vv.; see also
{#antarIpa#}. <sup>b.</sup> in Bahuvr., e. g. {#antaHsveda, antarvAzpa;#} some-
times meaning ‘from the interior’, e. g. {#antaHsuKa, antaHprajYa#}.
<sup>c.</sup> in Avyayībh., e. g. {#antarveSmam, antargiri#}. <sup>2</sup> After the
noun, in indecl. Tatpur., e. g. {#te nAlikerAntarapaH pibantaH;#} or
{#jalAntaScandracapalam;#} or {#udarAntaH praviSya;#} in such compounds
some comm. consider the former part as representing the
sense of a locative, not of a genitive ({#‘avyayatvAtzazWIsamA-#}
{#sapratizeDaH’#}), others not; e. g. {#saMpravezwumiva yozita IzuH Sli-#}
{#zyatAM hfdayamizwatamAnAm . AtmanaH satatameva tadantarvartino na#}
{#Kalu nUnamajAnan#} (comm. {#tezAmizwatamAnAmantarhfdaye#}).
<div n="P">VI. See {#antarA#}. E. {#am,#} uṇ. aff. {#aran#} and āgama {#tuw;#}
