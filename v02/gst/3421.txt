{#anuzuka#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-kaH#}) Probably the epithet of a divinity;
the same as {#Anuzuka#}. (Some read instead of this word {#anu-#}
{#sUyaka#} which seems to be wrong, others {#anuzUka#} which is
doubtful. Compare also {#Anusuka#}.) E. The Gaṇaratnama-
hodadhi derives {#anuzuka#} from {#anusU#} and {#ka#} (from {#kE#}) with
a short vowel before {#kaH anuzuvatIti anuzU . taM kAyatIti#}
{#anuzuka . ke'Ra iti hrasvatve;#} this application, however, of
Pāṇ. VII. 4. 13. to the etym. given, seems very objectionable.
