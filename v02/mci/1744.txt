the existence of Śyāma (black) mountain
in Śākadvīpa the people there are black in
colour; the reason for the black colour of the
mountain as told by Saṃjaya to Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
is that god Kṛṣṇa lives on that mountain and
the colour of the mountain has turned black
due to Kṛṣṇa's colour ({%śyāmo nāma mahā-%}
