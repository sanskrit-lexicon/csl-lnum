{@Uttarāyaṇa@}¦ nt.: Name of the period in
which the sun moves to the north, the summer
solstice; also called {@Udagā̆yana@} ({%-ā- m. c.%})
(6. 114. 98; 12. 224. 16).
{@A.@} Sun's courses fixed by Brahman:
Śakra told Bali that the self-born god (Sva-
yaṃbhū) had fixed the movements of the
sun following which the sun moved towards
the north for six months and towards the
south for six months 12. 218. 35-36. {@B.@}
Its duration: The calculators of the divi-
sions of time say that the year consists of
two {%ayanas%} (sun's courses), viz. {%dakṣiṇa%}
and {%uttara (saṃvatasaraṃ dve ayane vadanti%}
[Page233-a+ 40]
{%saṃkhyāvido dakṣiṇam uttaram ca)%} 12.
224. 13; (12. 47. 42); 13. 16. 46; Nārada
told Devamata that the two {%ayanas%} ({%dakṣiṇa%}
and {%uttara%}) form a pair and between them
is fire; Brāhmaṇas knew that that is the
highest form of {%udāna (? ubhe caivāyane%}
{%dvaṃdvaṃ tayor madhye hutāśanaḥ / etad%}
{%rūpam udānasya paramaṃ brāhmanā viduḥ)%}
14. 24. 15; Vyāsa had told Śuka that the night
and the day of the gods was equal to one
human year of which the {%uttarāyaṇa%} form-
ed the day and the {%dakṣiṇāyana%} the night
({%daive rātryahanī varṣam pravibhāgas tayoḥ%}
{%punaḥ / ahas tatrodagayanaṃ rātriḥ syād%}
{%dakṣiṇāyanam%}) 12. 224. 16. {@C.@} Effects
on the earth: The sun, during its two
courses, northern and southern, distributes
cold and heat among the people ({%ayanaṃ%}
{%tasya ṣaṇmāsā uttaraṃ dakṣiṇaṃ tathā / %}
{%yena saṃyāti lokeṣu śītoṣṇe visṛjan raviḥ //%})
12. 218. 36; the sun, having traversed its
northern course and having collected with his
rays the heated waters, turns for the southern
course and enters the earth; there, lying in
the earth and sprinkled with the energies of
the moon, it produces plants which serve as
food for living beings ({%gatvottarāyaṇaṃ%}

{%niṣiktaś candratejobhiḥ sūyate bhūgato%}

{%annaṃ prāṇināṃ bhuvi //%}) 3. 3. 6, 8 (Nī.
on Bom. Ed. 3. 3. 6: {%tejorasān jalāni%}).
{@D.@} Importance: Mahādeva (13. 16. 13)
identified with both the Uttara and the
Dakṣiṇa ayana 13. 16. 46. {@E.@} Considered
holy: The night in the Uttarāyaṇa is con-
sidered holy and divine; Śacī bowed down
to this goddess Rātri so that her wish to see
her husband was fulfilled ({%puṇyāṃ cemām%}
[Page233-b+ 40]
{%ahaṃ divyāṃ pravṛttām uttarāyaṇe / devīṃ%}
{%rātrim namasyāmi sidhyatāṃ me manora-%}
{%thaḥ //%}) 5. 13. 23; from Dakṣiṇāyana (which
symbolizes darkness) proceeds Uttarāyaṇa
(which stands for light); (hence) the gift of
light is praiseworthy ({%andhaṃ tamas tami-%}
{%sraṃ ca dakṣiṇāyanam eva ca / uttarāyaṇam%}
{%etasmāj jyotirdānaṃ praśasyate //%}) 13. 101.
46 (perhaps what is meant is that giving
gifts of light helps the bringing in of the
Uttarāyaṇa. Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 98. 47:
{%tamisraṃ andhakāraḥ / andhaṃtamo nāma%}
{%narakarūpaṃ tathā dakṣiṇāyanam apy%}
{%andhaṃtama eva / ata uttarāyaṇe rātrau%}
{%tamonāśakaṃ jyotir deyaṃ narakanivṛttyar-%}
{%tham.%} Editor, Cr. Ed., Vol. 17. (part II),
p. 1098 on 13. 101. 46, however,: “Does this
suggest the origin of the Dīpāvali festival ?”).
{@F.@} Bhīṣma's death in Uttarāyaṇa: Bhīṣma
when he fell on the ground in the war did not
give up his life as he wished to wait till the
setting in of the Uttarāyaṇa 6. 114. 89; he
assured the sages, sent to him by Gaṅgā, when
they came to him in the form of swans, that
he would sustain his life and go to his ori-
ginal place when the sun had turned towards
the north 6. 114. 97; he told them that he
would sustain his life longing for the Uttarā-
yaṇa; established in complete sway (over his
life), he could control the act of giving up
life; he would therefore hold life for some
time since he wished to die in the Udagāyana

114. 98 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 119. 106:
{%svasāmarthyena bhūtaḥ prāptaḥ svaccha-%}
{%ndamṛtyutvāt%}); Bhīṣma's future death in
the Uttarāyaṇa alluded to by Yudhiṣṭhira 12.
[Page234-a+ 38]
291. 4 ({%āvṛtte bhagavaty arke ganatāsi para-%}
{%māṃ gatim%}); Bhīṣma asked Yudhiṣṭhira to
come back to him when the sun had returned
from the Dakṣiṇāyana and the Uttarāyaṇa
had set in 13. 152. 10; when the Uttarāyaṇa
set in, Yudhiṣṭhira started from Hāstinapura
to meet Bhīṣma (for the remembered what
Bhīṣma had told him) 13. 153. 6; Bhīṣma
greeted Yudhiṣṭhira and said that the sun had
turned back (from the Dakṣināyana) 13.
153. 26; as soon as the sun had returned to
its northerly course Bhīṣma, well composed,
placed himself in his soul (to he ready to
abandon the body) 12. 47. 3; Bhīṣma gave
up his life when the Uttarāyaṇa had set in
14. 59. 12.
