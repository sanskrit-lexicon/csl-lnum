{@Sārisṛkva@}¦ m.: A young {%Śārṅgaka%} bird
(1. 220. 1, 2, 4; {%Śārṅga%} 1. 220. 3).
{@A.@} Birth: Second son of the sage
Mandapāla (turned into a {%Śārṅgaka%} bird)
and {%Śārṅgikā%} Jaritā 1. 221. 8; 1. 220. 16, 17;
all abandoned by their father when they
[Page066-a+ 41]
were still in eggs, but not abandoned by
their mother 1. 220. 17, 19; his father
expected him to beget children and extend
the line of his ancestors ({%sārisṛkvaḥ prajā-%}
{%yeta pitṝṇāṃ kulavardhanaḥ%} 1. 221. 8).
{@B.@} Description: All of them lustrous,
heroic seers, and had no fear from fire;
able speakers 1. 224. 8, 10; 1. 225. 2-3;
also called ‘who could discourse on {%brahman%}
({%brahmavādinaḥ%} 1. 220. 17). {@C.@} Khāṇḍava
fire: When the fire burning the Khāṇḍava
forest came close, the young birds, who had
not yet developed wings and feet, told their
mother to abandon them and fly to a place
which was free from fire; the mother
advised them to enter a nearby hole, but
they refused for the fear of a mouse; the
mother then left them to their fate; when the
young ones appealed to their eldest brother
to do something to save all of them,
Sārisṛkva said: “You are resolute and
intelligent, we are in danger to our life;
there is no doubt that only one among
many is really heroic and wise” (1. 223.
3); first Jaritāri, the eldest among them,
praised god Fire; when his turn came Sāri-
sṛkva drew the attention of god Fire to their
condition (deserted by parents; their wings
not grown) and appealed to him to save
them since they had no other saviour; Agni
should protect them that were seeking shelter
with his benevolent form and his seven
flames ({%sapta hetayaḥ%} 1. 223. 10); Jāta-
vedas alone gave heat and he should protect
the young ‘seers’ ({%ṛṣīn asmān bālakān%}
{%pālayasva%} 1. 223. 11; 1. 224. 8); the Fire
informed them that their father had already
appealed to him to save them; the Fire saved
the young ones 1. 221. 1-21; 1. 222. 1-18;
1. 223. 1-25; 1. 220. 20-32; 1. 225. 1;
when the forest was on fire, Mandapāla, the
[Page066-b+ 39]
father of the young ones, was worried
about their safety 1. 224. 2-6, 16; when the
fire subsided, the mother, and also the father,
returned to the young ones; the young birds
did not greet their father nor answered his
questions; in the end all were reconciled and
the father left with them for another country
1. 224 17-32; 1. 225. 1-4.
