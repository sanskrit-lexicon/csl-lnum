{@Palita@}¦ m.: A mouse.
{@A.@} Recidence: Lived in a hole, having
hundred outlets, at the foot of a banyan
tree 12. 136. 21. {@B.@} Qualities: He
was very wise, intelligent, thoughtful, versed
in scriptures, knew how things shaped them-
selves, and the proper time for conciliation and
feud ({%prājña%} 12. 136. 191; {%prajñāvant%} 12.

Uśanas himself in intelligence 12. 136. 127.
{@C.@} Palita-Lomaśa Episode: Once when
the cat Lomaśa who lived on the branches
of the same banyan tree was caught in the
trap ({%unmātha%}) fixed by a Cāṇḍāla, Palita
moved about fearlessly; he got a piece of flesh
and as he was eating it after taking it on
the top of the trap and smiling mentally
({%manasā hasan%} 12. 136. 28) at his enemy,
trapped below, Palita saw his second enemy,
a mongoose by name Harika, approaching
the tree and looking up at his prey; Palita
at that moment, also saw a third enemy, an
owl named Candraka, prowling from his
[Page038-a+ 41]
nest situated on the branch of the same tree;
apprehending danger from both directions,
Palita decided to take help from the cat, his
foe in distress, and find escape from all the
three 12. 136. 26-42; he therefore addressed
himself to the cat pointing out that there was
danger to the life of both of them, that both
lived on the same tree and therefore deserved
to be friends of each other on the basis of
common residence ({%savāso me 'si paṇḍitaḥ%}
{%vl. paṇḍita%} 12. 136. 54), that he was prepared
to cut the cords that bound the cat provided
the cat agreed not to kill him when freed;
Palita appealed to the cat: “I wish you live,
and you should wish that I live” 12. 136.
48-62; the cat agreed to the proposal and
asked Palita to do what was suited to the
occasion; Palita swore by truth ({%satyena te%}
{%śape%} 12. 136. 73) to cut down the net pro-
vided the cat agreed not to kill him when he
descended and crawled very close to the body
of the cat ({%ahaṃ tvānupravekṣyāmi%} 12.
136. 72); when the cat agreed to this, Palita
went near the cat and rested quietly on his
chest; seeing him safe, the mongoose and the
owl returned to their residence 12. 136. 66-82;
Palita then started to cut slowly the cords of
the net; when the cat asked Palita to finish
the work quickly, Palita advised him to be
patient; Palita would complete cutting the
net only when he saw the Caṇḍāla, who had
spread the net, approach; otherwise the cat
might prove dangerous to him; if the cat,
when freed, saw the Caṇḍāla drawing near
he would immediately mount the tree and
not waste his time in jumping on the mouse;
Palita then could safely enter his hole 12. 136.
83-93; when the cat persisted in asking
Palita to make haste, Palita replied as
follows: “I have made treaty with one who
is stronger than me, I have therefore to protect
[Page038-b+ 41]
myself; no one has any regard for the doer of
a good act, once the act has been fully done;
hence all good acts must be done with a part
left unfinished ({%na hi kaś cit kṛte kārye%}
{%kartāraṃ samavekṣate / tasmāt sarvāṇi%}
{%kāryāṇi sāvaśeṣāṇi kārayet%} 12. 136. 105);
now only one cord remains; I shall cut down
that too at proper time” 12. 136. 100-107;
at dawn when the Caṇḍāla Parigha appeared,
true to his word, Palita cut off the last cord;
the freed cat, as expected by Palita, jumped up
the tree and Palita entered the hole 12. 136.
109-116; when the Caṇḍāla left the scene, the
cat asked Palita to come out of the hole and
move freely among the cats without appre-
hending any danger; he asked Palita to become
his minister and even guide him like his father
({%amātyo me bhava prājña piteva hi praśādhi%}
{%mām%}) 12. 136. 119-126; but Palita refused to
oblige; he told the cat that there were no natu-
ral friends and no natural foes; hence there
were no permanent friendships and no perma-
nent enmities; friendships and enmities arise
due to certain common or conflicting interests
({%nāsti jātyā rīpur nāma mitraṃ nāma na%}
{%vidyate / sāmarthyayogāj jāyante mitrāṇi%}
{%ripavas tathā // nāsti maitrī sthirā nāma%}
{%na ca dhruvam asauhṛdam / arthayuktyā%}
{%hi jāyante mitrāṇi ripava s tathā //%} 12. 136.
132, 134); danger arising out of misplaced
trust cuts at the very roots; the affection bet-
ween them arose for some purpose; once that
purpose was served, friendship lost its ground;
mouse was food, and cat the eater; mouse was
weak cat strong; there could be no real
conciliation ({%sandhi%}) among parties of uneven
strength; Palita said he knew that it was the
cat's food time; that was the reason why the
cat was asking Palita to stir out; Palita finally
told the cat that if he remembered Palita's
good act let him wish well of the mouse ({%śivaṃ%}
[Page039-a+ 39]
{%dhyāyasva me 'trasthaḥ sukṛtaṃ smaryate%}
{%yadi%}) 12. 136. 160-166; the cat made one
more attempt to win the confidence of Palita
and praised him 12. 136. 177-182; Palita did
not relent; he recited two {%gāthās%} of Uśanas
(apparently 12. 136. 185-186) for the benefit
of the cat the purport of which was that if one
made conciliation ({%sandhi%}) with a person
stronger than himself to face a common enemy
he should not repose trust in his partner after
the purpose was served and that in all condi-
tions one should protect one's life since wealth
and children could be acquired if one remained
alive; Palita concluded that the sum and
substance of the {%nītiśāstras%} was that distrust
was the best policy ({%saṅkṣepo nītiśāstrāṇām%}
{%aviśvāsaḥ paro mataḥ%} 12. 136. 187); Palita
finally told the cat that the mouse must protect
himself from the cat as the cat must protect
himself from the Caṇḍāla; the cat, apparently
scared at hearing the word ‘Caṇḍāla’, ran
to his hole and Palita entered another hole;
thus the intelligent Palita, all by himself,
outwitted his many stronger enemies 12. 136.
