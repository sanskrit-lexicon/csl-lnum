{@*Jambūnadī<sup>3</sup>@}¦ f.: Name of a fabulous
river.
<div n="P">It has its origin in the silvery juice
({%rajatasaṃnibham rasam%}) of the ripe fruits
which fall down, from the great Jambū tree,
called Sudarśana, which is to the south of the
Nīla and to the north of the Niṣadha moun-
tain; the river flows around Meru keeping it to
the right, and then goes to the Uttara Kurus;
people drink that juice and then are not
affected by oldage ({%tasyā jambvāḥ phalaraso%}
{%nadī bhūtvā … / … tasmin phalarase pīte na%}
{%jarā bādhate ca tān%}) 6. 8. 18, 22-24.
