{@A.@} Description: Heavenly ({%divya%})
12. 5. 13-14; great ({%mahāstra%}) 3. 170. 38;
fierce ({%ghora%}) 3. 170. 40; 7. 53. 43; eternal

57. {@B.@} Identified with the Pāśupata (and
the Brahmaśiras ?): When Arjuna prayed to
Śiva to give him the divine missiles, he agreed
to Arjuna's request and told him that his
Raudra missile would wait on him; he then
gave him his Pāśupata 3. 163. 47-48; Brahma-
śiras missile, which Arjuna received from
Rudra, also called Raudra (or adj. ‘fierce’
of Brahmaśiras (?)) 3. 41. 8. {@C.@} Known
to Arjuna: Arjuna's collection of missiles
({%astragrāma%} 5. 166. 32) included Raudra
astra 3. 89. 10-11; Arjuna had received it
from Rudra 7. 53. 43; 12. 5. 13-14, and he
wanted to use it against the Kauravas at
the time of the cattle-raid 4. 56. 14. {@D.@}
Mode of use: At the time of using it (against
Karṇa), Arjuna recited the {%mantras (anu-%}
{%mantrya)%} on the arrow on which he employed
it 8. 66. 58; at the time of charging his
arrow with the missile (to release it against
the Pauloma and the Kālakeya demons)
Arjuna bowed down to Rudra ({%rudrāya%}
{%praṇato raṇe%}) and wished well to the crea-
tures ({%svasti bhūtebhyaḥ%}); he bowed down
to Śarva (Rudra) again when he actually
[Page130-b+ 40]
released the missile from the bow ({%namaskṛtvā%}
{%trinetrāya śarvāyāmitatejase%}) 3. 170. 38, 41.
{@E.@} Uses: 1. In the epic war: (i) Arjuna
wanted to employ it on a heavenly arrow,
resembling fire or snake's poison and which
was hard like a stone, and release it against
Kaṛṇa 8. 66. 58-59; there is no mention
of Arjuna having released it, but it seems
that he warded off Karṇa's Brahmāstra with it
(not named; {%tad astram astreṇāvārya praja-%}
{%hārāsya pāṇḍavaḥ%}) 8. 67. 8; (ii) Aśva-
tthāman killed the followers of Dhṛṣṭadyumna
who surrounded him after he killed Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna at night in the camp of the Pāṇḍavas
10. 8. 31-32; 2. Outside the epic war: (i)
Arjuna used it to burn with its fire the
Nivātakavaca demons 5. 136. 7; (ii) Arjuna
used it to kill the Pauloma and the Kālakeya
demons; Arjuna first used all his other missiles
without being able to defeat the demons, but
was himself oppressed by them; at that time he
was afraid; he bowed to Rudra and employed
the great Raudra missile on his arrow ({%mahā-%}
{%straṃ samayojayam%}); he then saw a man
having three heads, nine eyes, three mouths,
six hands, burning, his hair bright like the
sun or fire, his head covered with big snakes
({%tato 'paśyaṃ triśirasaṃ puruṣaṃ navaloca-%}
{%nam / trimukhaṃ ṣaḍbhujaṃ dīptam arka-%}
{%jvalanamūrdhajam // lelihānair mahānāgaiḥ%}
{%kṛtaśīrṣam%}) 3. 170. 38-39; when the missile
was next actually released ({%muktamātre tatas%}
{%tasmin%}) thousands of different shapes—wild
animals like lions, tigers, bears, buffalos,
as also snakes, cows, elephants, {%sṛmaras,%}
{%śarabhas,%} bulls, boars, wild cats, {%śālāvṛkas,%}
ghosts, {%bhuruṇḍas,%} vultures, eagles, crocodiles,
Piśācas, Yakṣas, demons, Guhyakas, Nairṛtas,
big fishes having mouths of elephants, owls,
hosts of fishes and tortoises, shapes holding
[Page131-a+ 39]
different weapons and swords, Yātudhānas
holding {%gadā%} and {%mudgara,%} and many
others—came out from the missile and filled
the space; the demons were killed by many
shapes having three heads, four tusks, four
mouths, four hands, as also by the arrows of
Arjuna which shone like the sun and the fire,
which were brilliant like the Vajra and
lightning, and hard like rocks; when the
demons were killed by the Raudrāstra, Arjuna
bowed down to Tripuraghna (Śiva) once
again 3. 170. 42-51.
