elephants mounted by the Mlecchas were
behind the army of the chariot-fighters ({%anva-%}

by horse-men ({%sādibhiś cāsthitāḥ%}); many
thousands of brave warriors, who would not
show their backs, armed with {%paṭṭiśa%} and
swords, acted as foot-guards of elephants and
of foot-soldiers (?) ({%teṣāṃ padātināgānāṃ%}
{%pādarakṣāḥ sahasraśaḥ%} 8. 31. 24); the
