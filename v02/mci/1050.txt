{@Udapāna<sup>3</sup>@}¦ m.: The well of Trita.
{@A.@} Location: Situated on the bank of
the river Sarasvatī 9. 35. 24, hence called
{%nadīgata%} 9. 35. 1, 53. {@B.@} Description:
Great ({%mahat%}) 9. 35. 24; very deep ({%agādha%})
and extremely terrible ({%sumahāghora%}) 3. 35.
25; without water ({%nirjala%}), hence covered
with soil ({%pāṃsusṃvṛta, pāṃsugrasta%}) 9.
35. 28, 32; covered with plants and grass
({%vīruttṛṇāvṛta%}) 9. 35. 29; frightful to all
creatures ({%sarvabhūtabhayaṅkara, prati-%}
{%bhaya%}) 9. 35. 25, 42. {@C.@} Events: (1)
Epic: Balarāma bathed there and gave ample
wealth to Brāhmaṇas and worshipped them 9.
35. 2, 52; he praised the {%tīrtha%} and left for
Vinaśanatīrtha 9. 35. 53; (2) Of the past
Yuga (9. 35. 7): Trita, afraid of a wolf,
fell into this well; his two brothers, Ekata
and Dvita (9. 35. 7), deserted him there
and went home (9. 35. 25, 27, 4-6); he, by
chance, saw a plant in the well (9. 35. 31);
using it as a Soma plant, Trita offered a
sacrifice in the well and drank Soma (9. 35.
32-35, 3); gods came to the well, where Trita
was consecrated for the sacrifice, to receive
their shares (9. 35. 40); Trita asked the
following boon from the gods: One who
bathes in this well shall obtain the same
condition after death as one who has (offered
a Soma sacrifice and) drunk Soma ({%yaś%}
{%cehopaspṛśet kūpe sa somapagatiṃ labhet%})
9. 35. 45; at that moment Sarasvatī sprang up
in the well and brought Trita out of the well
9. 35. 46. {@D.@} Simile: Trita's falling
down in the well compared to a sinner's
falling in the Naraka 9. 35. 29.
