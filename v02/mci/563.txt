{@Vajra<sup>1</sup>@}¦ nt. (m. 4. 2. 13; 12. 273. 7;
12. 31. 29): A missile generally associated
with Indra, but also on a few occasions
with Kṛṣṇa and Śiva; also called Kuliśa
({%kuliśaṃ maghavān iva%}) 3. 12. 43; 8. 13. 20.
{@I.@} As Indra's missile: {@A.@} Origin: Three
accounts: (1) when the Kāleya demons, under
the leadership of Vṛtra, attacked Indra and the
other gods, Brahman advised them to approach
the sage Dadhīca and ask him for his bones in
order to fashion a Vajra out of it; with that
Vajra, Indra was to kill Vṛtra 3. 98. 3-11;
when the gods received the bones of Dadhīca,
they took them to Tvaṣṭṛ and asked him to
fashion a Vajra out of the bones; Tvaṣṭṛ,
ritually ready ({%prayata%}) to receive the bones,
was glad to fashion the Vajra which he did
with great effort ({%prayatnāt%}) 3. 98. 22; when
the Vajra was ready, Tvaṣṭṛ asked Indra
to reduce his enemies to ashes with the
[Page131-b+ 40]
excellent Vajra ({%vajrapravara%}); Indra too
was happy and ritually ready ({%prayata%})
to receive it 3. 98. 23-24; (2) Vajra created
from the bones of Dadhīca in order to kill the
three-headed Viśvarūpa, son of Tvaṣṭṛ; when
the Vajra was fashioned by Dhātṛ, Viṣṇu
entered it ({%viṣṇupraviṣṭa%}); with the Vajra,
thus fortified, Indra cut off the heads of
Viśvarūpa 12. 329. 25-27; 1. 127. 12; (3)
during a conflict between the gods and the
demons Indra searched the three worlds for a
suitable weapon, but did not find it; he asked
the gods to approach the sage Dadhīca to ask
for his bones; when the bones were received,
Indra got prepared out of them various
divine missiles like {%vajras%} (pl.), discuses,
maces, and heavy {%daṇḍas (kārayām āsa%}
{%divyāni nānāpraharaṇāny uta / vajrāṇi%}
{%cakrāṇi gadā gurudaṃḍāṃś ca puṣkalān);%}
with this Vajra produced from the lustre of a

recitation of the {%mantras (tena vajreṇa … %}

Indra killed nine times ninety ({%navatīr nava%}

{@D.@} Use by Indra: 1. Incidents related
to the epic: (i) Indra released his lustrous
missile ({%svam astram asṛjad dīptam%}), not
named, against Arjuna at the time of the
Khāṇḍava fire; it produced lightnings;
Arjuna repelled it by Vāyavya astra 1. 218.
13, 15-16; Indra took up a thunderbolt
({%aśani, mahāśani%}), and, charging it with
Vajra missile, released it against Kṛṣṇa and
[Page133-a+ 40]
Arjuna ({%aśaniṃ gṛhya tarasā vajram%}
{%astram avāsṛjat%}), and told the gods that
the two were killed 1. 218. 29-30; Kṛṣṇa
paralysed Indra who wanted to strike him
with Vajra (reference to the Khāṇḍava fire ?)
13. 143. 26, 23; (ii) when Indra could not
dissuade Uttaṅka from desisting to dig the
earth with just a stick, he joined his Vajrāstra
with the stick; the earth, torn asunder by the
strokes of Vajra, made way for Uttaṅka to
go to the Nāgaloka 14. 57. 31-32; 2. Inci-
dents not related to the epic: (i) Indra
threatened king Marutta, first through Agni,
that in case the king did not forsake Saṃ-
varta who acted as his priest at the sacri-
fice, he would hurl his Vajra at him 14. 9. 24;
he again threatened Marutta, through the Gan-
dharva Dhṛtarāṣṭra, that he would use his
Vajra against the king 14. 10. 1, 2, 4, 7;
Saṃvarta, however, assured Marutta that if
Indra with his Vajra arrived to strike the
king, he would paralyse Indra, and that he
had destroyed before the weapons of all the
gods; Saṃvarta then said: “let the wind
blow and may it drive away the Vajra to the
directions; let there be rain and may it fall
on the forests; let waters float in the mid-
region and let there be lightning in the sky
({%diśo vajraṃ vrajatāṃ vāyur etu varṣaṃ%}

{%bibhas tvam //%}) 14. 10. 13; ({%vajraṃ tathā%}
{%sthāpayatāṃ ca vāyuḥ%}) 14. 10. 14; Marutta
was still afraid of the sound of Vajra and of
the winds, and then Saṃvarta again assured
the king that he would become wind and
strike down the Vajra to dispel the king's
fear 14. 10. 15-16; (ii) Indra asked his
missile Vajra in the bodily form ({%mūrtisaṃs-%}
{%thita%}) to turn into a tiger and kill Suvarṇa-
[Page133-b+ 40]
ṣṭhīvin, son of king Sṛñjaya, as he was
afraid of the prince's growing strength 12.
31. 27-28; when Vajra ({%vajraḥ%}) was so
addressed, he began to look for a suitable
opportunity and when it arrived he, as tiger,
killed Suvarṇaṣṭhīvin; after killing the
prince, the tiger disappeared by the {%māyā%} of
Indra 12. 31. 29-34; (iii) when the sage
Cyavana wanted to offer Soma to Aśvinā
Indra objected to it; in spite of the objec-
tion, when Cyavana was about to fill
the cup for the Aśvinā, Indra threatened
Cyavana to strike him with Vajra; when
Cyavana still proceeded to fill the cup, and
Indra was about to strike the Vajra, Cyavana
paralysed Indra's arm 3. 124. 8, 15-17; 14. 9.
31-32; 12. 329. 14(3); 3. Mythological
incidents: (i) Vṛtra episode: (a) in the
battle between the gods and Vṛtra, helped by
the Kālakeyas, Indra released his Vajra to kill
Vṛtra; when struck by the Vajra, Vṛtra was
killed 3. 99. 1-3, 13-14; however, Indra felt
as if he had not released the Vajra from his
hand and that Vṛtra was not killed 3. 99. 15;
(b) when the gods approached Viṣṇu for his
help in their fight against Vṛtra, Viṣṇu advised
them to establish peace for the time being
with Vṛtra, and when the proper time came he
would enter the Vajra of Indra 5. 10. 11-12;
Vṛtra was ready to make peace if he would
not be attacked by Indra or by the gods with
anything that was dry or wet, which was stone
or wood, which was a weapon ({%śastra%}) or
Vajra, and if they would strike neither by
day nor by night 5. 10. 29; Indra killed Vṛtra
with foam which was fortified with Vajra;
Viṣṇu had entered that foam ({%savajram%}
{%atha phenaṃ taṃ kṣipraṃ vṛtre nisṛṣṭa-%}
{%vān / praviśya phenaṃ taṃ viṣṇur atha%}
{%vṛtraṃ vyanāśayat%}) 5. 10. 38; 3. 299. 15;
[Page134-a+ 40]
(c) Maheśvara told Indra to kill Vṛtra
with Vajra; Indra agreed 12. 272. 38-39; in
the fight that ensued, Indra came with Vajra
in his hand; he struck Vṛtra with Vajra; the
Vajra (m.) killed him; Viṣṇu had entered the
Vajra 12. 273. 5-7, 9; 12. 272. 31; 12. 274. 2;
(d) in the fight between Indra and Vṛtra,
when the latter covered the earth, Indra re-
leased his Vajra at him; Vṛtra then entered
successively water, fire, wind, and then ran
to ether ({%ākāśa%}); each time Indra struck
him with Vajra; finally Vṛtra entered Śakra
(Indra); in that condition Indra struck Vṛtra
with an invisible Vajra ({%adṛśyena vajreṇa%})
14. 11. 6-19; (ii) Viśvarūpa-Triśiras
episode: (a) when the gods led by Indra
approached god Brahman complaining that
Viśvarupa (Triśiras), son of Tvaṣṭṛ, drank
away all Soma offered in sacrifices, and that
they were left without a share, Brahman
advised them to approach the sage Dadhīca
and request him to give up his body; the gods
should then fashion a Vajra from the bones
of Dadhīca 12. 329. 24-25; when Dadhīca
gave up his body, Dhātṛ fashioned a Vajra
out of the bones; with that Vajra, produced
from the bones of a Brāhmaṇa and in which
god Viṣṇu had entered, Indra killed Viśvarūpa
and cut off his heads 12. 329. 27; (b)
when Indra failed to tempt Triśiras, son of
Tvaṣṭṛ, with Apsarases while he was practis-
ing penance, he decided to strike Vajra at
him; when struck by Vajra, Triśiras fell down
like the summit of a mountain; Indra was
still afraid of Triśiras and he asked a wood-
cutter ({%takṣan%}) to cut off the heads of the
lying Triśiras assuring Takṣan that he would
make his axe Vajra-like ({%matprasādād dhi%}
{%te śastraṃ vajrakalpaṃ bhaviṣyati%} 5. 9. 27);
the woodcutter finally cut off the heads of
[Page134-b+ 40]
Triśiras with his axe 5. 9. 15-34; (iii) Meet-
ing of Bali and Indra: when Indra met Bali
in the form of a donkey ({%khara%} 12. 216. 12),
Bali told Indra that he could fell down Indra
with his fist although Indra was equipped with
Vajra, but that that was the time to show for-
bearance ({%kṣamā%}) and not valour ({%vikrama%})
12. 217. 38-39; 12. 220. 79-80; Indra told
Bali that since he was asked by god Brahman
not to kill Bali, he was not releasing his
Vajra at him (Bali) (12. 218. 33); Indra
asked Bali why he was not grieved although
he was formerly struck by Vajra 12. 220.
18; Bali told Indra that he was not afraid of
him (Indra) although he saw him with his
Vajra raised ({%vajram udyamya tiṣṭhantam%})
12. 220. 21; Indra was surprised at the tran-
quility of Bali for he was not afraid of Indra
with Vajra raised in his hand 12. 220. 89;
(iv) Garuḍa episode: on his way to fetch
{%amṛta,%} when Garuḍa flew to the mountain
whose caves were blocked with snow, there
were bad omens for the gods; Indra's dear
missile Vajra blazed with pain ({%indrasya%}
{%vajraṃ dayitaṃ prajajvāla vyathānvitam%}) 1.
26. 28; when Garuḍa was taking away {%amṛta,%}
Indra struck him with Vajra; Garuḍa smiled
and told Indra that just out of respect for the
sage (Dadhīca) from whose bones the Vajra
was fashioned, out of respect for Vajra itself,
and Indra, he would let fall just one of his
feathers; otherwise, due to the blow of the
missile, he felt no pain at all; surprised, Indra
sought friendship with Garuḍa 1. 29. 17-23;
(v) Fight between the gods and Skanda:
when during the fight between the gods and
Skanda, the gods abandoned Indra, he released
his Vajra at Skanda; it struck Skanda on his
right side and split it open; due to the impact
of Vajra was produced another young man
[Page135-a+ 40]
({%puruṣo 'paraḥ / yuvā%}) with golden armour,
wearing heavenly {%kuṇḍalas,%} and holding
{%śakti;%} he became Viśākha since he was pro-
duced due to {%vajraviśana (yad vajraviśanāj%}
{%jāto viśākhas tena so 'bhavat)%} 3. 216. 12-
14 [{%viśana%} ‘opening made by the Vajra’ ?
Nīla.: ‘digging up of the arm’ {%bāhor%}
{%ākhananāt%} Bom. Ed. 3. 227. 17]; (vi)
Śiva and Indra: (a) Śiva, in the form of a
child in the lap of Umā, froze the arm of
Śakra which held Vajra (since apparently
Indra wanted to strike Vajra at the child
not realising that the child was Śiva); when
Brahmā and the other gods propitiated Śiva
(Rudra) and Umā, Indra's hand, holding the
Vajra, became as before 7. 173. 60-63; 13.
145. 30-34; (b) Indra once desirous to have
Maheśvara's glory hurled his Vajra at him;
it burnt Maheśvara's throat and departed;
that is why Śiva is called Śrīkaṇṭha ({%tena%}
{%śrīkaṇṭhatā mama;%} Nīla. {%śrakaṇṭhatā = nīla-%}
{%kaṇṭhatā%} on Bom. Ed. 13. 127. 47) 13. 128.
8; (vii) Indra and Mandara: Mandara, son
of Hiraṇyakaśipu, fought with Indra for a
million years; due to the boon he had obtained
from Mahādeva (Śiva) Indra's Vajra was
shattered on the limbs of the “tormentor”
({%graha ?%}) Mandara 13. 14. 53-54 (Nī.
{%grahasya mandāranāmnaḥ%} on Bom. Ed.
13. 14. 75). {@E.@} Knowledge of Vajra by
Arjuna and its use by him: Arjuna learnt
({%adhītavān%}) the Vajra missile from Indra
(and other missiles from Yama, Kubera,
and Varuṇa) 3. 89. 12; (i) Mātali advised
Arjuna to use Indra's favourite missile
against the Nivātakavaca demons; Arjuna
released ({%udīraya-%}) it after resorting to a
firm place ({%acalaṃ sthānam āsādya%}) and
after reciting the {%mantras%} on the Gāṇḍīva
bow ({%gāṇḍīvam anumantrya ca%}); the result
[Page135-b+ 40]
was that the sharp, iron arrows released from
his bow had the impact of Vajra ({%amuñcaṃ%}
{%vajrasaṃsparsān āyasān niśitāñ śarān%});
the arrows, propelled by the Vajra and which
had themselves become Vajra-like ({%te vajra-%}
{%coditā bāṇā vajrabhūtāḥ%}) pierced the {%māyās%}
of the demons and the demons themselves;
they all fell down on the ground when struck
by the impact ({%vega%}) of Vajra; the arrows
killed also those demons who had entered the
ground 3. 169. 12-17; (ii) Arjuna used the
Vajra missile to kill the Saṃśaptaka warriors
who showered arrows at Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna
to completely cover them 7. 26. 19-20.

16; 9. 16. 14; 11. warriors or elephants
falling on the battle-field compared with the
mountains (or their summits) falling down
when struck by (Indra's) Vajra: (i) warriors
(or their heads, or head-gears) 6. 42. 19;
7. 53. 40; 8. 15. 38; 8. 40. 105; 8. 66. 17;
8. 66. 31 (only distressed); 8. 67. 26; 12. 27.
5 (only shaking); (ii) elephants (some-
times along with their riders) 4. 60. 10;

struck by arrows compared with trees struck
by Vajra 6. 70. 24; 6. 103. 91; 7. 172. 23;
12. fight between two heroes compared
with that between Vajra and the mountain:
between Bhīma and Jarāsandha 2. 21. 11;
between Yuyudhāna (Sātyaki) and the
Kauravas 5. 3. 15; between Pradyumna and
his opponents 5. 3. 19; between Ghaṭotkaca
and Alaṃbala 7. 149. 26; 13. fear, like
the burning Vajra, torments the timid ones
in the army 12. 103. 23. {@G.@} Its use
for punishment and not as a missile:
(1) Sudhanvan warned Prahlāda that if,
in reply to a question, he told what was
false, Indra would pound his head with Vajra
into hundred pieces 2. 61. 63; (2) Bṛha-
spati told the gods what had been proclaimed
by Brahman in ancient times ({%purā gītaṃ%}
{%brahmaṇā%} 5. 12. 18): if one hands over
to the enemy the person who has sought
refuge, the gods with Indra strike him with
Vajra 5. 12. 21. {@H.@} Status: The best
among the weapons ({%āyudhānāṃ varo vajraḥ%}
(m.)) 4. 2. 13; an object of worship and
[Page136-b+ 38]
honour: (i) when Vajra struck Vṛtra's
head, it (the Vajra) was shattered into ten,
and then into hundred pieces; the gods shared
the pieces of Vajra among themselves and
worshipped them; (ii) whatever is efficaci-
ous in the world is supposed to have the
built of Vajra ({%loke yat sādhanaṃ kiṃcit%}
{%sā vai vajratanuḥ smṛtā%} 1. 158. 48);
hence a Brāhmaṇa's hand is considered
to be made of Vajra, a Kṣatriya has his
chariot of Vajra, a Vaiśya's gift is as
efficacious as Vajra, and those junior to a
Vaiśya (the Śūdras) are supposed to have
Vajra's strength in their service; the horses
of a Kṣatriya are as good as Vajra and
hence they are inviolable ({%vajrapāṇir brāh-%}
{%maṇaḥ syāt kṣatraṃ vajrarathaṃ smṛtam /%}
{%vaiśyā vai dānavajrāś ca karmavajrā yavī-%}
{%yasaḥ // vajraṃ kṣatrasya vājino avadhyā%}
{%vājinaḥ smṛtāḥ%}) 1. 158. 49-50; however,
Vajra made ineffectual when Nīlakaṇṭha
(Śiva) granted a boon to Nārāyaṇa that
Vajra will not have any effect on him 7.
172. 77-78.
{@II.@} As Kṛṣṇa's missile: Kṛṣṇa cut off
all the mountains hurled at him by a demon
fighting from the side of Śālva, with his
dear missile Vajra which was capable of
breaking all rocks ({%sarvapāṣāṇabhedana%})
3. 23. 17.
{@III.@} As Śiva's missile: Śiva is called
{%vajrin%} 7. 172. 59; 13. 15. 11; 13. 17. 128;
and {%vajrahasta%} 13. 17. 70.
{@IV.@} Vajra as a general missile, not
associated with any individual: Many Vajras
were used during the fight between Bhīma
and Karṇa 7. 113. 20; Vajras were used by the
Rākṣasas of Ghaṭotkaca against the Kaurava
[Page137-a+ 40]
army 7. 154. 36; even the blades of grass
acted like Vajras when the time was ripe
(mode of expression) ({%pakvānāṃ hi vadhe%}
{%sūta vajrāyante tṛṇāny api%}) 7. 10. 47.
