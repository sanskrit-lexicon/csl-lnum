<div n="P">Karṇa while deriding Śalya told him
what a certain Brāhmaṇa had once told
[Page884-a+ 39]
Dhṛtarāṣṭra (8. 30. 7, 28); according to him
the people of the town Śākala, young and
old, well-adorned, and their fair and large
women, ate meat of many rams mixed with
onions and {%gaṇḍūṣa%} (?), as also meat
of pigs, fowls, cows, asses and camels;
they said that the lives of those who did
not eat meat of sheep was futile; they
danced and sang songs of this nature
when they drank liquor; good conduct
was not expected of such people ({%aiḍaṃ%}
{%ca ye na khādanti teṣāṃ janma nirartha-%}
{%kam // iti gāyanti ye mattāḥ śīdhunā%}
