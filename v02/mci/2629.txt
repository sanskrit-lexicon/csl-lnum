{@Jyeṣṭhasāman@}¦ nt.: Name of a Sāman.
{@A.@} Referred to in some past events:
(1) Upamanyu told Śakra that when he saw
Śiva Mahādeva, he was being praised by all
gods (13. 14. 146); Nārāyaṇa at that time
praised Mahādeva by singing the {%stotra%}
using Jyeṣṭhasāman ({%jyeṣṭhasāmnā ca%}
{%deveśaṃ jagau nārāyaṇas tadā%}) 13. 14. 147
[Editor's note, with a question mark, on the
stanza, Vol. 17, p. 1060 Jyeṣṭhasāman =
Bārhatasāman ?]; (2) In the Kṛtayuga the
Sātvata Dharma was received by Brahman
from Nārāyaṇa himself and was taught to
the Barhiṣad sages; from them it went to a
Brāhmaṇa called Jyeṣṭha who was versed in
the Sāmaveda ({%sāmavedāntagaṃ dvijam%});
in this context it is said that god Hari
observes the {%vrata%} of Jyeṣṭhasāman ({%jyeṣṭha-%}
{%sāmavrato hariḥ%}) (i. e. Hari always uses
Jyeṣṭhasāman while singing praises) 12. 336.
42. {@B.@} Its holiness: One who can sing
a {%stotra%} using Jyeṣṭhasāman melody is
included among those Brāhmaṇas who are
considered to be {%paṅktipāvana%} or {%pāṅkteya%}
(i. e. highly respectable, one who purifies
those who sit in a line with him while tak-
ing meals ({%pāṅkteyāṃs tu vakṣyāmi jñeyās%}
{%te paṅktipāvanāḥ / … chandogo jyeṣṭha-%}
{%sāmagaḥ%}) 13. 90. 19-20.
