On the eleventh day of war, Arjuna affli-
cted Yaudheya Kṣatriyas with arrows; but
even though they were being killed by
Arjuna they showered different kinds of
arrows on Arjuna so that Arjuna, his
chariot, and Kṛṣṇa became invisible as
they were concealed by arrows; feeling
that they had hit the target and Arjuna
and Kṛṣṇa were killed, Yaudheyas and
others roared, waived their upper garments
and blew {%bheris,%} horns and conches;
Arjuna removed the screen of arrows by
employing {%vāyavyāstra%} 7. 18. 16-22; (3)
In the night war, Yudhiṣṭhira killed hordes
of Yaudheyas and others; at that time the
Yaudheya warriors shouted in confusion
“kill him, bring him, capture him,” or
“pierce him, cut him” ({%hatāharata gṛhṇīta%}

teenth day, at night, when Dhṛtarāṣṭra
asked Saṃjaya who in the army of Kaura-
vas were dead and who were alive (8. 4. 3),
Saṃjaya mentioned Yaudheyas among
those who were killed by Arjuna 8. 4. 46.
