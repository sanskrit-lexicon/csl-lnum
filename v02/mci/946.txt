of Sūrya, will be the great Manu ({%śanaiś-%}
{%caraḥ sūryaputro bhaviṣyati manur mahān /%}
[Page271-a+ 40]
{%tasmin manvantare caiva%}) 12. 337. 52;
Śanaiścara, along with the other planets,
visits the {%sabhā%} of Brahman (2. 11. 20);
mentioned in the Daivatavaṃśa (13. 151.
12). {@C.@} Name of Sūrya: Śanaiścara
appears as the 31st name in the list of a
hundred names of Sūrya taught by Dhau-
mya to Yudhiṣṭhira 3. 3. 20. {@D.@} Omens:
Among the bad omens observed by Vyāsa
before the war and reported to Dhṛtarāṣṭra
there was one according to which the planet
Śanaiścara was afflicting the constellation
Rohiṇī ({%rohiṇīṃ pīḍayann eṣa sthito rājañ%}
{%śanaiścaraḥ%}) 6. 2. 32; but in another state-
ment Vyāsa said that Sūryaputra (i. e.
Śanaiścara) was afflicting the constellation
Bhāgya i. e. the Uttarā Phalgunī ({%bhāgyaṃ%}
{%nakṣatram ākramya sūryaputreṇa pīḍyate%})
6. 3. 14 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 3. 14:
{%bhagaṃ nakṣatraṃ pūrvāphalgunī śruti-%}
{%mate tūttarā phalgunī%}); still according to
another observation of Vyāsa the two blaz-
ing planets Bṛhaspati and Śanaiścara were
stationed near the two Viśākhā stars and
had remained there for a year ({%saṃvatsara-%}
{%sthāyinau ca grahau prajvalitāv ubhau /%}
{%viśākhayoḥ samīpasthau bṛhaspatiśanaiś-%}
{%carau //%}) 6. 3. 25 (for Nī.'s comm. see
{@Bṛhaspati@}); (2) According to one of the
bad omens observed by Karṇa and reported
to Kṛṣṇa, Śanaiścara was afflicting the con-
stellation Prājāpatya, i. e. Rohiṇī and as a
result was afflicting the living beings all the
more ({%prājāpatyaṃ hi nakṣatraṃ grahas%}
{%tīkṣṇo mahādyutiḥ / śanaiścaraḥ pīḍayati%}
{%pīḍayan prāṇino 'dhikam%}) 5. 141. 7. {@D.@}
Simile: (1) Śalya, fighting with Yudhi-
ṣṭhira, looked like Śanaiścara in the vicinity
of Candramas 9. 15. 10; (2) Ārjuni
(Abhimanyu) and Citrasena who came close
[Page271-b+ 39]
to each other in a duel looked like the
planets Budha and Śanaiścara in the sky
6. 100. 20; (3) Rāvaṇa approaching Sītā
looked like Śanaiścara moving near Rohiṇī
3. 265. 6.
