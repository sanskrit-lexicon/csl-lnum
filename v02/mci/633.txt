[Page167-a+ 39]
<div n="P">Bhagavān (Nārāyaṇa) told the seven
sages (Marīci, Atri and others 12. 322. 27)
that the {%śāstra%} composed by them in a
hundred thousand {%ślokas%} and from which the
{%dharma%} proceeds is one which is approved
by (i. e. is in accordance with) the Ṛks,
Yajus and Sāmans, as also the Atharvāṅgi-
rasas ({%kṛtaṃ śatasahasraṃ hi ślokānām%}
{%idam uttamam / … yasmād dharmaḥ%}
{%pravartate // … ṛgyajuḥsāmabhir juṣṭam%}
{%atharvāṅgirasais tathā%}) 12. 322. 36-37; when
Kṛṣṇa asked Arjuna to insult Yudhiṣṭhira
which was as good as ‘killing’ him, he told
Arjuna that his instruction was according
to the Atharvāṅgirasī Śruti which was the
best among the Śrutis and which should be
practised without hesitation by those who
desired welfare ({%atharvāṅgirasī hy eṣā%}
{%śrutīnām uttamā śrutiḥ / avicāryaiva%}
{%kāryaiṣā śreyaḥkāmair naraiḥ sadā //%}) 8. 49.
69; an extract ({%udāharaṇam%}) from the
Atharvaveda used by the sage Aṅgiras (or
Atharvāṅgiras 5. 18. 6, 8) to praise Indra was
to be known as Atharvāṅgirasa ({%atharvāṅ-%}
{%girasaṃ nāma asmin vede bhaviṣyati /%}
{%udāharaṇam etad dhi%}) 5. 18. 5-7; the
Śakti hurled by Yudhiṣṭhira at Śalya is
compared with the {%kṛtyā%} produced by the
{%mantras%} from the Atharvāṅgirasa ({%kṛtyām%}
{%atharvāṅgirasīm ivogrām%}) 9. 16. 43. [See
{@Atharvan, Atharvaśiras, Ātharvaṇa@}]
