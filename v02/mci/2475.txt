Different Origins: (1) In the bygone
days, the sages churned the right thigh
of king Vena whom they had killed;
from it arose a dwarfish person ({%hrasvā-%}
{%ṅgaḥ%}); him, the sages said ‘sit down’
({%niṣīda%}); from him were born Niṣādas
and other Mlecchas in hundreds and
thousands living on Vindhya mountain
({%tasmān niṣādāḥ saṃbhūtāḥ … ye cānye%}
{%vindhyanilayāḥ mlecchāḥ śatasahasraśaḥ%})
12. 59. 101-103; (2) Mlecchas were
[Page841-a+ 40]
produced by Nandinī, Vasiṣṭha's cow, from
her foam; they and other peoples produced
by Nandinī formed a large army; they wore
different armours and held different wea-
pons ({%mlecchān phenataḥ sā sasarja ha //%}

here the term {%mlecchagaṇa%} is used to in-
clude Pallavas and others who were also
then produced by Nandinī); the origin
of Mlecchas from cows also referred to in
7. 68. 42 ({%goyoniprabhavā mlecchāḥ%}) and
in 7. 87. 36 ({%santi goyonayaś cātra%}); (3)
All Mleccha tribes sprang from Anu, the
son of Yayāti ({%anos tu mlecchajātayaḥ%}) 1.
80. 26; (4) Originally all were Brāhmaṇas
({%na viśeṣo 'sti varṇānāṃ sarvaṃ brāhmam%}
{%idaṃ jagat%}) 12. 181. 10; later, Brāhmaṇas
who did not know (the {%dharma%} and did not
observe the vows and regulations) became
different tribes such as Mlecchas ({%brahma%}

Mlecchas ({%mānuṣāṇāṃ malaṃ mlecchā%}

Mlecchas had joined the army of Pāṇḍavas

day, countless Mlecchas, along with the
elephants who carried them, were killed by
Arjuna with the {%māyā%} of his {%astras (astra-%}
{%māyayā); vaḍas, kaṅkas%} and wolves were
glad to drink their blood 7. 68. 37, 42,
44, 46; 7. 69. 30; (7) On the same day,
Sātyaki noticed the large army of Añjanaka
[Page843-a+ 40]
elephants ridden by Mlecchas 7. 87. 16-18;
having secured that large army of elephants
of Mlecchas, Duryodhana had felt contempt
for Pāṇḍavas ({%etad duryodhano labdhvā%}
{%samagraṃ nāgamaṇḍalam … avamanyata%}
{%pāṇḍavān // %}) 7. 87. 37-39; Sātyaki pointed
out to his charioteer the Mlecchas who,
riding chariots, horses and elephants, and
equipped with different weapons, desired to
fight with him 7. 95. 13-14; (8) Duḥśā-
sana, rebuked by Droṇa, attacked Sātyaki
along with a large army of Mlecchas ({%sai-%}
{%nyena mahatā yukto mlecchānām anivarti-%}
{%nām%}) 7. 98. 23; (9) The same day, Bhīma
defeated and passed beyond many hordes
of Mlecchas in order to get near Arjuna
7. 103. 32; (10) On the fifteenth day,
Bhīma while scolding Droṇa mentioned
that he, like a Cāṇḍāla, had killed many
hordes of Mlecchas 7. 165. 30; (11) On
the sixteenth day, Mlecchas (8. 17. 9) riding
elephants fought a severe battle with
Dhṛṣṭadyumna and other Pāṇḍava promi-
nent warriors 8. 17. 1-28 (for details of
the battle see {@Mekala@}); (12) On the
seventeenth day, Mlecchas riding elephants
in rut, led by Aśvatthāman and others,
followed the chariot-army of Duryodhana
at the back of the Bārhaspatyavyūha (8.
31. 26) of Kauravas 8. 31. 19-20, 22; the
same day, Kṛṣṇa in order to encourage
Arjuna said that Mlecchas who had asso-
ciated themselves with Kurus in the interest
of Duryodhana could not be conquered
by any one else except him ({%mlecchāś ca … %}
{%ete suyodhanasyārthe saṃrabdhāḥ kurubhiḥ%}
{%saha / na śakyā yudhi nirjetuṃ tvadanyena%}
{%paraṃtapa //%}) 8. 51. 19-20; Mlecchas, riding
thirteen hundred elephants in rut, attacked,
as directed by Duryodhana, Arjuna from
[Page843-b+ 40]
one side ({%pārśvataḥ%}); they showered
Arjuna with {%karṇin, nālīka,%} and {%nārāca%}
arrows as also with {%tomaras, prāsas, śaktis,%}
{%kampanas%} and {%bhiṇḍipālas;%} Arjuna cut off
the shower of their arrows and weapons
with {%bhalla%} and {%ardhacandra%} arrows; he
killed their elephants with different kinds
of {%mahāśaras;%} the elephants began to run
in all directions 8. 59. 10-16; (13)
After the war was over, while Saṃjaya
was reporting events of the eighteenth
day to Dhṛtarāṣṭra, the latter remembered
that once the whole earth, including
the Mlecchas and Āṭavikas was sustained
due to the graciousness of Duryodhana
({%iyaṃ ca pṛthivī sarvā samlechāṭavikā … /%}
{%prasādād dhriyate yasya%}) 9. 31. 3; later,
Saṃjaya in his account listed Mlecchas
among those who were killed in the great
war ({%mlecchāś ca … nipātitāḥ%}) 9. 1. 26;
Dhṛtarāṣṭra remembered that Duryodhana,
before the war, counted Mlecchas among
those who, in thousands, were ready
to fight and give up their lives for him;
it was with their support that he was
going to fight with Pāṇḍavas ({%mlecchāś%}
{%ca bahusāhaśrāḥ … madartham udyatāḥ%}
{%sarve prāṇāṃs tyaktvā raṇe prabho //%}) 9.
2. 18, 21-22; that they were killed by
thousands, was due to bad fate according
to Dhṛtarāṣṭra ({%hatā … mlecchāś ca%}

9. 2. 36; (14) Mlecchācāryas were
among those who attended the {%svayaṃ-%}
{%vara%} of the Kaliṅga princess at Rājapura
12. 4. 8; (15) Arjuna in his wanderings
with the Aśvamedha horse had to fight
with Mlecchas who were formerly, in the
war, offended by him ({%mlecchāś cānye%}
{%bahuvidhā pūrvaṃ vinikṛtā raṇe%}) 14,
[Page844-a+ 40]
72. 24; when the horse wandered along
the seacoast through Vaṅga, Puṇḍra and
Kerala countries, Arjuna defeated many
Mleccha armies many times ({%tataḥ samudra-%}

Aśvamedha sacrifice, the sacrificial priests
distributed a large quantity of gold among
the Brāhmaṇas; after that, what wealth
(gold) remained that was taken away
over a long period by Kṣatriyas, Vaiśyas,
Śūdras and Mleccha tribes ({%anantaraṃ%}

On Arjuna's way from Dvārakā to Hāstina-
pura, Mlecchas abducted Vṛṣṇi and
Andhaka women 16. 8. 61. {@F.@} Past
events: (1) Demons Sunda and Upasunda
conquered all Mleccha tribes living in the
ocean ({%samudravāsinaḥ sarvān mleccha-%}

forsaken by Nala, entered a forest inhabited
by Mlecchas and thieves ({%mlecchataskara-%}
{%sevitam%}) 3. 61. 2; (3) Indra taught king
Māndhātṛ the duties of Dasyus which term
included Mlecchas 12. 65. 14, 17-22; (4)
Bhīṣma told Yudhiṣṭhira a story related
to Mlecchas who lived in the north (the
term Dasyu is used in the story for
Mlecchas) 12. 162. 28 ff.; (5) Yayāti
cursed his son Turvasu to the effect that
he would be born among the Mlecchas

Future event: Mārkaṇḍeya foretold that
in the Kali age ({%kalau yuge%} 3. 186. 27)
