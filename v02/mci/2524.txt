{@Videha<sup>2</sup>@}¦ m. (pl.): Name of a Janapada.
{@A.@} Location: Listed by Saṃjaya
among the northern Janapadas (also called
Deśas 6. 10. 68) of Bhāratavarṣa ({%ata%}
{%ūrdhvaṃ janapadān nibodha%}) 6. 10. 37, 5;
({%kirātā barbarāḥ siddhā videhās tāmraliṅga-%}
{%kāḥ%}) 6. 10. 55 (these Videhas seem to be
different from Videhas<sup>1</sup> since these are listed
along with Kirātas and others). {@B.@}
Description: Karṇa mentioned to Śalya
of a certain Brāhmaṇa who in the Kuru
assembly, equated Videhas with Āraṭṭas
(Bāhlīkas) and described them as non-
sacrificers, those who had lost their {%dharma%}
and hence whose country should not be
visited; this description seems to apply to
these Videhas<sup>2</sup> and not to Videha<sup>1</sup> above
({%āraṭṭā nāma te deśā naṣṭadharmān na tān%}
{%vrajet / vrātyānāṃ dāsamī yānāṃ videhānām%}
{%ayajvanām%}) 8. 30. 36.
