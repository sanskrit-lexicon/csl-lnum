{@Haṃsapada@}¦ m. (pl.): Name of a
people.
<div n="P">On the twelfth day of the war, Haṃsa-
padas and many others, led by Kṛtavarman
and Kṛpa, formed the ‘eyes’ ({%cakṣuṣī%}) of
the Suparṇavyūha of the Kauravas 7. 19. 4,
6-7 (to be identified with Haṃsamārga ?
Cf. Editor's Critical note on the stanza: “If
they are the same people as Haṃsamārga
mentioned in 6. 10. 68, then the B S reading
Haṃsapatha would be preferable” Cr. edn.
Vol. 9, p. 1147;) [See the next entry].
