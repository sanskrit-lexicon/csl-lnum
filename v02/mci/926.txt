{@Mārgaśīrṣī@}¦ f.: The full moon day of the
month of Mārgaśirṣa.
{@A.@} Epic event: The Pāṇḍavas, toge-
ther with Dhaumya and other forest dwellers,
started on their pilgrimage from the Kāmyaka
forest under the constellation Puṣya when
the full moon day of the month of Mārgaśīrṣa
had passed ({%mārgaśīrṣyām atītāyāṃ puṣyeṇa%}
{%prayayus tataḥ%}) 3. 91. 25. {@B.@} Proper
time for army manoeuvre: Marching out of
the army for attack on the full moon day
of the month of Caitra or of Mārgaśīrṣa is
recommended since the crops the are ripe
and water is ample; it is then also neither
too hot nor too cold 12. 101. 9-10 (for the
citation, see above {@Caitrī,@} p. 246. 1).
