stands for Khāṇḍava forest); this feat of
Arjuna at Khāṇḍavaprastha (= Khāṇḍava

[Page515-a+ 40]
ed to him the wealth brought by him 2. 29.
18; (15) After the Rājasūya, when Dur-
yodhana visited the Mayasabhā in Indra-
prastha, the Pāṇḍavas laughed at Duryo-
dhana (Bhīṣma told this to Yudhiṣṭhira)
12. 124. 5 (reference to 2. 43. 7, 9); (16)
Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Vidura to go to Khāṇ-
ḍavaprastha to invite Yudhiṣṭhira for a

snatched away from him by Duryodhana in
the game of dice (Karṇa told Duryodhana)

Yudhiṣṭhira had to leave for the forest
leaving behind the great city Śatakratu-

when he met him in the forest that he
(Kṛṣṇa) could kill the Kauravas and get

seen at Indraprastha at the time of Rāja-
sūya (and of which he was now deprived)
3. 48. 17, 23; (21) Duryodhana re-
minded Dhṛtarāṣṭra that when Kṛṣṇa and
the other kings met the Pāṇḍavas in the
forest, at a place not far from Indraprastha
({%vanaṃ pravrājitān pārthān … indraprastha-%}
{%sya cādūrāt samājagmuḥ%}), they blamed
Dhṛtarāṣṭra and the other Kauravas 5. 54.
2, 4; (22) Aśvatthāman asked Karṇa in
derision in which battle did he (Karṇa)
[Page515-b+ 40]
win Indraprastha from the Pāṇḍavas; now
Karṇa should fight with Arjuna (at the time
of the cow raid at Virāṭanagara) since he
was responsible for the game of dice and for
winning Indraprastha 4. 45. 10, 21; (23)
Yudhiṣṭhira told Saṃjaya “Let Suyodhana
recognize my kingship at Indraprastha and
I shall be at peace with the Kauravas”
({%śāntiṃ gamiṣyāmi yathā tvam āttha / indra-%}
{%prasthe bhavatu mamaiva rājyaṃ suyodhano%}
{%yacchatu bhāratāgryaḥ //%}) 5. 26. 28; he
again asked Saṃjaya to tell Duryodhana:
“Hand over Śakrapura to me or get
ready for battle” ({%dadasva vā śakrapuraṃ%}
{%mamaiva yudhyasva vā bhāratamukhya%}
{%vīra //%}) 5. 30. 47; Bhīṣma, after he fell on
the battlefield, also advised to hand over
half of the kingdom to the Pāṇḍavas and
let Yudhiṣṭhira rule at Indraprastha ({%rā-%}
{%jyasyārdhaṃ dīyatāṃ pāṇḍavānām indra-%}
{%prasthaṃ dharmarājo 'nuśāstu%}) 6. 116; 48.
(24) Kṛṣṇa reminded Dhṛtarāṣṭra that he
himself and his sons had sent away Yudhi-
ṣṭhira to Indraprastha ({%indraprasthaṃ tva-%}
{%yaivāsau saputreṇa vivāsitaḥ%}), where he
(Yudhiṣṭhira) brought under control other
kings and made them subservient to Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra 5. 93. 55-56 (reference to 1. 199.
24-25; 1. 214. 1); (25) After the Pāṇḍa-

the merchants of Dvārakā ({%naigamāḥ%}),
who had gathered around him, that he
would take with him the Vṛṣṇis and the
Andhakas to Śakraprastha since Dvārakā
would be merged in the ocean ({%śakra-%}

{%prastham ahaṃ neṣye vṛṣṇyandhakajanaṃ%}

that Vajra would be their king at Śakra-
prastha ({%vajro 'yaṃ bhavatāṃ rājā śakra-%}
{%prasthe bhavīṣyati%}) 16. 8. 11; Arjuna reha-
bilitated the old, the young and the women
of the Vṛṣṇis and the Andhakas at Śakra-
prastha ({%śakraprasthe nyaveśayat%}) 16. 8.
68; Arjuna gave the kingdom of Indra-
prastha to Vajra 16. 8. 70; (27) Yudhi-
ṣṭhira told Subhadrā, when he decided to
abandon the kingdom, that Parikṣit would
be the king of Hāstinapura and Vajra, the
Yādava, of Śakraprastha ({%parikṣid dhāstina-%}
