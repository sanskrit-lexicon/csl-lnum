{@Tārā@}¦ f.: A female monkey, wife of
Vālin.
{@A.@} Description: Of moon-like face
({%tārādhipānanā%} 3. 264. 18, {%tārāpatimukhī%}
3. 264. 39), having moon-like lustre ({%tārā-%}
{%dhipaprabhā%} 3. 264. 20). {@B.@} Dutiful and
intelligent wife: She forbade Vālin from start-
ing out of their residence when he heard
Sugrīva's loud roar; from the way Sugrīva
roared, she feared he had found a protector;
since Tārā could understand the meaning of
the cries of all beings ({%sarvabhūtarutajñā%}
3. 264. 19), Vālin asked her to find out whose
protection Sugrīva had secured; after contem-
plating for a while she told Vālin incidents
beginning with the abduction of Sītā upto
Sugrīva's entering into an alliance with Rāma;
she also told him about the helpers of Rāma;
in the opinion of Tārā all these helpers,
intelligent and strong, were capable of
destroying Vālin; Vālin misunderstood Tārā's
advice and doubted that she secretly loved
Sugrīva; he spoke harsh words to her and
went out 3. 264. 16-25; in the end Tārā saw
Vālin fallen on the ground. {@C.@} Marriage
with Sugrīva: Sugrīva got Tārā, whose
husband was dead, along with the kingdom
of Kiṣkindhā 3. 264. 38-39.
