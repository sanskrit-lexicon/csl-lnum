{@Āsyamodaka@}¦ nt.: Name of a missile
({%astra%}).
<div n="P">One of the eight {%astras%} of Arjuna
recounted by Rāma (Jāmadagnya) to Dur-
yodhana; when struck by any one of these,
the victim died, or became insane, or lost
consciousness, or he slept, or jumped up, or
vomited, or passed urine, or he wept or
laughed incessantly; (perhaps Āsyamodaka
produced only the last effect of making the
adversary weep or laugh incessantly ?) 5. 94.
38-40.
