{@Aghamarṣaṇa@}¦ nt.: Name of a sacred
text (Ṛgveda 10. 190. 1-3) composed by the
sage Aghamarṣaṇa, son of Madhucchandas.
<div n="P">According to Manu, one who takes a
dip into water and recites the Aghamarṣaṇa
{%mantras%} thrice (a day) acquires the fruit of
an Aśvamedha sacrifice; such a person drives
away quickly his sin, is honoured, and all
beings try to please him ({%api cainaṃ prasī-%}
{%danti bhūtāni%}) 12. 148. 26-27; one who bathes
in the water of the Kulyātīrtha and repeats
the Aghamarṣaṇa {%mantras%} and, remaining
undefiled, fasts for three nights gets the fruit
of an Aśvamedha sacrifice 13. 26. 53; while
observing the {%brahmacarya%} vow, if one slips
(makes a fault) in sleep he should recite
mentally the Aghamarṣaṇa {%mantras%} thrice;
this way he burns the sin within himself
which was the result of the quality of passion
({%magnaḥ svapne ca manasā trir japed%}
{%aghamarṣaṇam // pāpmānaṃ nirdahed evam%}
{%antarbhūtaṃ rajomayam%}) 12. 207. 13-14.
