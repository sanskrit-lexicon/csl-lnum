{%kampanaḥ%}) 13. 14. 52; (10) Mṛtyu, con-
ceived as a woman, was reluctant to carry
out the instruction of Brahman to destroy
creatures; she went to Meru and stood
there motionless like a log of wood for doing
good to creatures ({%bhūtānāṃ hitakāmyayā%})
12. 250. 22; (11) Gaṅgā, unable to bear

present at the consecration of Kumāra (Ska-
nda) as the chief of the army of gods 9.

[Page423-b+ 40]
and others 12. 59. 122; (15) King Marutta
went to Meru and performed a sacrifice
at the foot of the mountain; his sacrificial
enclosure was close to the mountain ({%tasyaiva%}

this sacrifice Marutta used utensils made of
gold obtained from Meru 14. 4. 25-27; (16)
Ekata, Dvita and Trita told Bṛhaspati that

(Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 325. 14: {%meror varṣaṃ%}
{%ilāvṛtam / harer varṣaṃ harivarṣākhyam%});
when Śuka moved through the sky he saw
before him the two summits of Meru and
Himavant closely connected with each other;
undeterred Śuka went on flying and suddenly
the two peaks split into two; that was a
marvel; Śuka passed beyond the two peaks
and the mountain (Meru or Himavant ?)
could not stop his movement; the mountain
[Page424-a+ 40]
was split into two 12. 320. 8, 10-11, 13;

as a cloud showers rain on Meru 7. 141. 13;

of Dhṛtarāṣṭra showered arrows on Abhi-

with his raised silvery staff with five stars on
it ({%ketunā pañcatāreṇa … rājatena%}) looked
like Meru with moon on it ({%candramā iva%}

was best among warriors as Meru is among
the mountains 5. 63. 5; (b) Outside the epic
war: (i) Rāma (Jāmadagnya) with blood
issuing from the wounds all over his body
appeared like Meru throwing out the red mine-
rals ({%merur dhātūn ivotsṛjan%}) 5. 180. 30;
(c) Other contexts: (i) Śiva's body, when
he was dressed like a Kirāta which made him
look like a golden tree, appeared like another
Meru ({%kairātaṃ veṣam āsthāya kāñcana-%}
{%drumasaṃnibham / vibhrājamāno vapuṣā%}
{%girir merur ivāparaḥ //%}) 3. 40. 2; (ii)
(Gāndhārī, Kuntī, and other) Kaurava women
mounted the seats (in the arena) as the women

[Page425-a+ 40]

phants, and other kinds of beasts resorted to
it and since it offered shelter to travellers
({%sārthādhivāsaiś ca%}) it shone like Meru
12. 150. 17; (vii) A tree called Mahāśaṅkha
at the Śaṅkhatīrtha was as tall as Mahāmeru
9. 36. 20 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 9. 37. 31: {%nagaṃ%}
{%vṛkṣam%}); (viii) The burning Khāṇḍava
forest looked like the highly lustrous, golden
Meru 1. 216. 34 (also see the next section
Idioms). {@I.@} Idioms: (1) For describing
unexpected or impossible events: (i) Fall of
Bhāradvāja (Droṇa) was like displacing Meru
({%viparyāsaṃ yathā meroḥ%}) 7. 165. 73;
(ii) Dhṛtarāṣṭra could not bear the felling of
Droṇa as he could not bear the shifting of
Meru 7. 33. 18 ({%meror iva visarpaṇam%}) 7. 8.
12; (iii) Karṇa's death was as unbelievable
and unexpected ({%aśraddheyam ivādbhutam%})
as is the tossing about ({%paryasanam%}) of
Meru 8. 5. 3; (iv) In the opinion of Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra, wishing to conquer Droṇa in battle
was as unheard of as wind uprooting Meru
({%na hi śuśruma vātena merum unmathitaṃ%}
{%girim%}) 5. 158. 15; (v) also in his opinion if
the Pāṇḍavas were to win the war it would be
like wind blowing away Meru ({%anilo vā%}
{%vahen merum%}) 5. 158. 16; (vi) in the
opinion of Saṃjaya one may carry off Meru
({%api meruṃ vahet kaścit%}) but it would not
[Page425-b+ 40]
be possible for any one to overpower the Vṛṣṇi
heroes 7. 119. 27; (iii) Kṛṣṇa's out of place
great delight ({%atiharṣo 'yam asthāne%} 7. 155.
6) and the lightness of his heart ({%tathaital%}
{%lāghavam%}) over the death of Ghaṭotkaca was
(as unbelievable) as the shifting of Meru
({%meror iva visarpaṇam%}) 7. 155. 10; (iv)
Menakā told Indra that Viśvāmitra by his
{%tapas%} could abbreviate Mahāmeru and quickly
turn it around ({%saṃkṣipec ca mahāmeruṃ%}
{%tūrṇam āvartayet tathā%}) 1. 65. 36 (Nī.,
who reads {%tūrṇam āvartayed diśaḥ,%} on Bom.
Ed. 1. 71. 36: {%āvartayed ekīkuryāt%}); (v)
Karṇa could split asunder even Meru ({%nir-%}
{%bhindyām … api merum%}) with his special
arrow which he had reserved for Kṛṣṇa or
Arjuna 8. 27. 59; (vi) Only a person who
could transgress the lustre of Meru would
(do such an unthinkable act as) killing one
who had taken resort with him ({% … pra-%}
{%bhāṃ meroḥ … etany atikramed yo vai sa%}
{%hanyāc charaṇāgatam%}) 13. 98. 10; (2) To
express great difference: (i) According to
Śakuntalā the difference between her and king
Duḥṣanta was as great as between Meru and
the mustard seed ({%āvayor antaraṃ paśya%}
{%merusarṣapayor iva%}) 1. 69. 3; (ii) It may
be possible to tell the number of all the
jewels on Meru ({%meroḥ … sarvaratnaiḥ%}
{%saṃkhyā … vaktum śakyam%}) but it was not
possible to describe or measure the virtues of
the Gaṅgā waters 13. 27. 97. [See {@Kanaka-@}
