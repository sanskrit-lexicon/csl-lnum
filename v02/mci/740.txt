{@Pauloma@}¦ nt.: Name of the 4th {%parvan%}
in the list of a hundred sub-{%parvans%} of the
Bhārata supposed to have been made by
Vyāsa in the Parvasaṃgraha 1. 2. 34, 33, 70.
<div n="P">In the Pauloma parvan is narrated the
extension of the lineage of Bhṛgu ({%bhṛguvaṃ-%}
{%śasya vistāraḥ%}) from Bhṛgu to Śunaka 1. 2.
72; 1. 5. 7-8; 1. 8. 1-2; Sūta Ugraśravas is
supposed to say that he would narrate the
Pauloma Ākhyāna immediately after the
beginning ({%yat tu śaunakasatre te bhāratā-%}
{%khyānavistaram / ākhyāsye tatra paulomam%}
{%ākhyānaṃ cāditaḥ param%}) 1. 2. 29 [this
statement apparently refers to the occurrence
of the Pauloma parvan ({%adhyāyas%} 1. 4-12)
in the present text of the Mahābhārata where
at the beginning of the {%adhyāya%} 1. 4 the words
{%lomaharṣaṇaputra ugraśravāḥ%} etc. occurring
[Page191-b+ 39]
at 1. 1 are repeated; {%āditaḥ param%} seems
to mean ‘from the beginning onwards’;
V. S. Sukthankar, however, renders the line
{%ākhyāsye%} etc. as ‘then shall I narrate, to
begin with, the excellent story of Pauloma’
ABORI 11. 183 (1930) = Sukthankar Memo-
rial Edition I. 219 (1944)]; the Pauloma
parvan comprises the {%adhyāyas%} 1. 4-12.
