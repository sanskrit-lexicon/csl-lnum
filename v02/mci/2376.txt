Epic events: Drupada became the king of
the Uttara Pāñcāla after his father's death
1. 121. 10; (2) Kauravas and Pāṇḍavas
attacked the Pāñcālas and crushed the
capital town of Drupada ({%mamṛdus tasya%}
{%nagaraṃ drupadasya%}) 1. 128. 4; (3) After
his defeat, Drupada was allowed by Droṇa
to rule over the southern Pāñcālas, with
Kāmpilya as its capital 1. 128. 12, 15;
(4) After their escape from Vāraṇāvata,
Pāṇḍavas passed through many countries,
one of them being Pāñcāla 1. 144. 2; (5)
A certain Brāhmaṇa told Pāṇḍavas about
the {%svayaṃvara%} to be held in the Pāñcāla
country 1. 153. 7; (6) When Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna arose from the sacrificial fire,
delighted Pāñcālas shouted ‘good, good’
({% … praṇeduḥ pāñcālāḥ prahṛṣṭāḥ sādhu%}
{%sādhv iti%}); an invisible being in the sky
({%mahad bhūtam adṛśyaṃ khecaraṃ%}) declar-
ed that Dhṛṣṭadyumna would remove the
fear of the Pāñcālas and bring them fame
1. 155. 39-40; (7) When Pāñcālas heard
the heavenly voice at the rise of Draupadī
from the sacrificial altar, they roared like a
horde of lions; the earth could not bear
their burden who were filled with joy
({%praṇeduḥ siṃhasaṃghavat / na caitān%}
{%harṣasaṃpūrṇān iyaṃ sehe vasauṃdharā%})
1. 155. 46; (8) Kuntī suggested to Pāṇḍavas
[Page766-b+ 39]
to go to Pāñcāla 1. 156. 6; Vyāsa too
advised them to go to the town of Pāñcālas
(Kāmpilya) for the {%svayaṃvara (pāñcāla-%}
{%nagaraṃ … praviśadhvam)%} 1. 157. 15; trave-
lling Brāhmaṇas advised Pāṇḍavas to do
the same 1. 175. 5; (9) Pāṇḍavas started
for the southern Pāñcālas and reached it
1. 176. 2, 5; this event is referred to
earlier in the summary narration of the
Mahābhārata in the Parvasaṃgrahaparvan
1. 2. 86, and again at 1. 55. 21; (10)
The southern Pāñcālas, afraid of Jarā-
sandha, left their land and went further
south; they also fled in different directions
({%dakṣiṇā ye ca pāñcālāḥ … tathottarāṃ%}

26-28; (11) Bhīmasena, in his expedi-
tion to the east ({%yayau prācīṃ diśaṃ%}
{%prati%} 2. 26. 1; also 2. 23. 9); before the
Rājasūya, won over Pāñcālas by various
means of conciliation ({%pāñcālān vividho-%}
{%pāyaiḥ sāntvayām āsa%}) 2. 26. 3; this event is
referred to later in 4. 5. 19 where, however,
it is said that he defeated them in battle
({%pāñcālān … saṃgrāme bhīmaseno'jayat%});
Pāñcālas did not pay tribute for Rājasūya
because they had marriage-relationship
with Pāṇḍavas ({%vaivāhikena pāñcālāḥ%}) 2.
48. 42; (12) Vidura told Kauravas that
Pāñcālas would not forgive the torture to
Draupadī (in the Sabhā); Arjuna, prote-
cted by Pāñcālas, would invade them 2.
72. 29-30; (13) Pāñcālas meeting the
Pāṇḍavas in the forest (3. 13. 2) referred
to in the narration of the contents of the
Āraṇyakaparvan 1. 2. 106; (14) Drau-
padī complained to Kṛṣṇa that though
[Page767-a+ 40]
Pāñcālas were alive Kauravas desired
to treat Draupadī as a Dāsī 3. 13. 56; (15)
Dhṛtarāṣṭra was afraid that later Pāñ-
cālas, protected by Kṛṣṇa, would burn the
Kaurava army 3. 48. 6; (16) Bhīma
feared that if Arjuna (who had departed
to get weapons) was dead, Pāñcālas,
Pāṇḍavas and the rest would perish 3. 49.
6; (17) Bhīma told Draupadī that Pāñcā-
las, with the support of Arjuna, would not
be afraid of even gods if they had to fight
with them 3. 79. 20; (18) Before the
{%ajñātavāsa,%} Yudhiṣṭhira asked the women
who attended on Draupadī, as also cooks
and chief cooks, to go to the Pāñcāla
country 4. 4. 4; (19) According to Drau-
padī, the affliction she had to suffer
while living as Sairandhrī meant insult
to Kurus and Pāñcālas 4. 19. 11; (20)
Karṇa told Bhīṣma that Pāṇḍavas were
claiming their share because they depen-
ded on the force of Pāñcālas and Matsyas
({%rājyam icchanti paitṛkam / balam āśritya%}
{%matsyānāṃ pāñcālānāṃ ca%}) 5. 21. 11;
(21) Yudhiṣṭhira could have resorted to
war without going into exile since the
Pāñcālas were always available to him for
guidance ({%nityaṃ pāñcālāḥ sacivās tave-%}
{%me%}) 5. 27. 17; (22) By avoiding war,
Yudhiṣṭhira wished Pāñcālas to meet Kurus
with a smile; he desired both of them to
remain uninjured and, well-disposed, live
in peace ({%akṣatān kurupāñcālān paśyema … %}
{%sarve sumanasas tāta śāmyāma%}) 5. 31. 21-
22; (23) Saṃjaya told Dhṛtarāṣṭra that
Pāñcālas and Pāṇḍavas were waiting for
the orders of Yudhiṣṭhira ({%rājño mukham%}
{%udīkṣante%}); they, riding chariots, greeted
him when he approached them 5. 49. 4-7;
Saṃjaya also told Dhṛtarāṣṭra that Pāñcā-
[Page767-b+ 40]
las did not honour him and that they des-
pised him ({%nārhanti pāñcālāś … sarve%}
{%tvām avajānate%}) 5. 53. 17; (24) Pāñcālas
mentioned by Dhṛtarāṣṭra among those
who sided with Pāṇḍavas 5. 56. 33; (25)
Duryodhana assured Dhṛtarāṣṭra that
Pāñcālas would be attacked by his chariot-
fighters with arrows 5. 56. 42; he also told
him that he would soon hear Pāñcālas
defeated by him 5. 60. 25; (26) Pāñcālas
and Pāṇḍavas counted on Dhṛṣṭadyumna's
fortitude and valour 5. 56. 51; (27) Karṇa
told Duryodhana that the {%brahmāstra%}
he had obtained from Paraśurāma was still
with him and hence due to the favour of
the {%ṛṣi%} (Paraśurāma) he would kill Pāñcā-
las and the rest in no time; that was his
responsibility ({%tatas tad astram mama%}
{%sāvaśeṣaṃ / tasmāt samartho 'smi mamaiṣa%}
{%bhāraḥ // … tam ṛṣiprasādam avāpya pāñ-%}
{%cāla° … /nihatya%}) 5. 61. 4-5 (Nī., however,
on Bom. Ed. 5. 62. 4: {%sāvaśeṣaṃ mama%}
{%āyur asti /ato 'ntakālasyānupasthitatvāt tad%}
{%astraṃ mamāstīty ahaṃ samartho 'smi%});
(28) Yudhiṣṭhira, although backed by
Pāñcālas and others, chose to ask for five
villages 5. 70. 14; (29) Even when Pāñcālas
were alive, Draupadī was looked upon as
a {%dāsī%} in the Sabhā of the wretched
Kauravas 5. 80. 25; (30) Kṛṣṇa told
Karṇa that the Pāñcālas and others
would consecrate him as king; Pāñcālas
would follow him in his procession 5.
138. 16-17, 23; (31) Vidura told Kuntī
that Yudhiṣṭhira was supported by Pāñ-
cālas 5. 142. 3; there was nothing more
painful to Kuntī than Pāñcālas and others
fighting with Bhāratas 5. 142. 3, 12; (32)
When Pāñcālas proceeded towards Kuru-
kṣetra, they were led by Bhīmasena 5. 149.
[Page768-a+ 40]
50; (33) Duryodhana and others were to
kill Pāñcālas in battle 5. 162. 22; Droṇa was
to burn Pāñcālas ({%pradhakṣyati sa pāñcā-%}
{%lān%}) 5. 164. 20; Pāñcālas would run in all
directions when they encountered Karṇa 5.
165. 21; (34) Pāñcālas and Prabhadrakas
formed the army of Śikhaṇḍin 5. 168. 3;
(35) Hiraṇyavarman's friends wanted to
kill Drupada and instal another king in
the Pāñcāla country if Śikhaṇḍin proved to
be a girl 5. 191. 8; (36) Saṃjaya reported
that Bhīṣma showered arrows on Pāñcālas
6. 15. 25; on the first day of war, Bhīṣma's
chariot moved very often among Pāñcālas
and he killed them 6. 45. 4, 54; (37) On
the second day, Arjuna asked Kṛṣṇa to take
him to Bhīṣma since Droṇa and others,
protected by Bhīṣma, would kill Pāñcālas
6. 48. 15 (13); Pāñcālas cheered loudly
when Dhṛṣṭadyumna cut off a fierce and
shining arrow discharged at him by Droṇa
6. 49. 13; Bhīma was honoured by Pāñcā-
las when he killed Kaliṅga warriors 6. 50.
110 (108); (38) On the third day,
Pāñcālas stood in the middle of the Ardha-
candravyūha of the Pāṇḍavas 6. 52. 14, 10;
Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya how the
Pāñcālas fared against Bhīṣma 6. 55. 2;
seeing the river of blood made to flow by
Arjuna's sharp arrows, Pāñcālas delight-
fully raised a loud roar 6. 55. 126, (121-
125); (39) On the fourth day, the chief
warriors of Pāñcālas stood at the same
place of the same {%vyūha%} as they did on
the previous day 6. 56. 11; when Bhīṣma
and others marched to help Bhagadatta,
Pāñcālas and others chased them; since
Bhīṣma did not like to continue fighting
with Ghaṭotkaca, Pāñcālas and others he
thought of declaring the end of the war
[Page768-b+ 40]
for that day 6. 60. 64, 68; (40) On the
fifth day, although Pāñcālas were getting
killed by Bhīṣma, they rushed at him with
spirited mind ({%āryāṃ yuddhe matiṃ kṛtvā%})
6. 68. 31; (41) On the sixth day, Bhīṣma
put to death the armies of Pāñcālas with
arrows the joints of which were smooth
6. 75. 57; (42) On the seventh day,
Droṇa scattered away Pāñcālas ({%vyadha-%}
{%mat%}) 6. 82. 38; (43) On the eighth day,
Bhīṣma felled down great Pāñcāla archers,
but not afraid of death ({%tyaktvā mṛtyukṛtaṃ%}
{%bhayam%}), they attacked Bhīṣma; he cut off
their hands and heads and broke their
chariots; those who fought from horse-
backs also lost their heads 6. 84. 3-6;
Bhīṣma strove to kill Pāñcālas while Arjuna
fought with their adversaries to protect
them 6. 89. 9; when Bhagadatta wanted
to reach Yudhiṣṭhira, he had to fight
a fierce battle with Pāñcālas who were
prepared to fight with weapons ({%udyatā-%}
{%yudhaiḥ%}) 6. 91. 80; on the night of
that day, Duryodhana reminded Bhīṣma
of his vow to kill Pāñcālas 6. 93. 37;
Bhīṣma assured Duryodhana that he
would kill all Pāñcālas who were taking
part in the war or would get himself killed
by them 6. 94. 14-15; (44) On the ninth
day, Duryodhana told Duḥśāsana that if
they protected Bhīṣma, he would kill
Pāñcālas who had made a common cause
with Pāṇḍavas ({%yattān pāñcālān pāṇḍavaiḥ%}
{%saha%}) 6. 101. 4; (45) On the tenth day,
Dhṛṣṭadyumna, protected by Pāñcālas,
stood behind Sātyaki and Cekitāna in the
Sarvaśatrunibarhaṇavyūha of Pāṇḍavas;
Bhīṣma rushed towards them 6. 104. 4, 6,
29; Pāñcālas tried to check Bhīṣma who
was killing his opponents 6. 105. 8; Bhīṣma
[Page769-a+ 40]
dried up the lustre of the eminent and
very strong Pāñcāla princes ({%pāñcālānāṃ%}
{%ca ye śreṣṭhā rājaputrā mahābalāḥ / teṣāṃ%}
{%ādatta tejāṃsi%}) 6. 105. 31; Bhīṣma sugge-
sted to Yudhiṣṭhira, who was close to him,
that if he desired Bhīṣma to be killed,
Arjuna, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas should
jointly lead the attack on him; accor-
dingly Arjuna, along with Pāñcālas and
Cedis, and led by Śikhaṇḍin, marched
towards Bhīṣma 6. 111. 15, 26; Bhīṣma
in his battle with Matsyas and Pāñcālas,
alone, killed innumerable elephants and
horses, seven great chariot-fighters, and
in addition five thousand chariot-fighters
and fourteen thousand footsoldiers 6. 113.
21-22; when Bhīṣma killed seven great
chariot-fighters, there arose a great roar
({%kilakilāśabdaḥ%}) among Pāñcālas and
others who, riding horses, chariots, ele-
phants, and also those who fought on foot
attacked Bhīṣma 6. 113. 46-48; when Bhīṣma
fell, Pāñcālas blew conches 6. 114. 107; at
his fall in the evening of the tenth day
({%sāyāhne%}) Pāñcālas were delighted 6. 115.
7; (46) In the summary narration of the
events which occurred while Droṇa was
the general of the Kaurava army, it is
mentioned that the large army of Pāñcālas
was scattered by Droṇa when he agitated
it and penetrated it ({%saṃkṣobhyamāṇā%}
{%droṇena bhidyamānā mahācamūḥ%}); they,
led by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, trembled ({%samakam-%}
{%panta%}) while they got killed by Droṇa
7. 6. 34, 36; whenever Pāñcālas attacked
Droṇa he killed them along with their
horses and broke their chariots; ultimately
Pāñcālas killed Droṇa by doing evil and
cruel deeds ({%pāñcālair aśivaiḥ krūrakarma-%}
{%bhiḥ / hato rukmaratho rājan kṛtvā karma%}
[Page769-b+ 40]
{%suduṣkaram //%}) 7. 7. 20-21, 32; (47) On
the eleventh day, Pāñcālas attacked the
warriors led by Aśvatthāman who attacked
Draupadī's sons 7. 15. 11; at the end of
that day, they praised Arjuna when he
declared the end of the war for the day
7. 15. 50; (48) On the twelfth day, Pāñcā-
las attacked Droṇa; he scattered them
away and repeatedly defeated them 7. 20.
18-19, 23; when a Pāñcāla prince ({%pāñcā-%}
{%lya,%} not named) was killed by Droṇa,
Pāñcālas attacked Droṇa shouting ‘kill
Droṇa, kill Droṇa’; in the fierce battle,
Droṇa threw the excessively angered Pāñ-
cālas ({%bhṛśasaṃkruddhān%}) into disorder
7. 20. 46, 48-49; Pāñcālas, getting killed by
Droṇa, trembled ({%samakampanta%}) 7. 20.
53; they were broken ({%bhagna%}) by Droṇa
7. 21. 1; pierced by Droṇa's arrows, they
were thrown back from their positions
({%calitān%}); Duryodhana pointed out to
Karṇa Droṇa's feat and described the
plight of Pāñcālas 7. 21. 7, 11-14; Pāñcālas
gathered around Bhīma 7. 21. 23; of the
twelve thousand great warriors of Pāñcālas
six thousand followed Śikhaṇḍin 7. 22.
14; the remaining six thousand Prabha-
drakas (Pāñcālas), riding chariots, with
raised weapons and stretched bows, and
making death as their common goal
({%samānamṛtyavo bhūtvā%}) followed Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna 7. 22. 36-37; Bhagadatta was en-
circled by Yudhiṣṭhira and Pāñcālas; Bhaga-
datta, riding his elephant, scattered them
away; he forced them to run away 7. 25. 24,
26, 41; Pāñcālas, shouting ‘(attack) Droṇa’
({%droṇam droṇam iti … pāñcālāḥ samaco-%}
{%dayan%}) incited one other; wherever Droṇa
attacked the group of Pāñcāla chariot-
fighters, Dhṛṣṭadyumna went to their help
[Page770-a+ 40]
7. 30. 6, 8; although afflicted by Droṇa's
arrows ({%śarārtāḥ%}), Pāñcālas did not give up
fighting with him; Droṇa killed many of
them 7. 31. 38-39; (49) On the thirteenth
day, Pāñcālas, checked by Droṇa's arrows
could not approach him who was protecting
Kaurava army; that was a wonderful feat
({%tad adbhutam apaśyāma … /yad enaṃ%}
{%nābhyavartanta pāñcālāḥ … %}) 7. 34. 10;
Bhīma assured Abhimanyu that he, Pāñcā-
las and others would follow him when he
entered the Cakravyūha 7. 34. 22; Duḥśā-
sana told Duryodhana that he would kill
Abhimanyu in the presence of Pāṇḍavas
and Pāñcālas 7. 38. 22; when Duḥśāsana
swooned in his encounter with Abhimanyu,
Pāñcālas raised a loud roar; led by Yudhi-
ṣṭhira they then attacked Droṇa's army
7. 39. 17-18; Pāñcālas and others attacked
Jayadratha who foiled their attempt to
follow Abhimanyu 7. 42. 18; Arjuna would
have himself protected Abhimanyu if he
had known that Pāñcālas could not do
that 7. 50. 74; Subhadrā wondered who
could kill Abhimanyu as though he was
helpless when heroic Pāñcālas were there
to help him 7. 55. 9; she felt contempt for
the strength of Pāñcālas ({%pāñcālānāṃ ca%}
{%dhig balam%}) 7. 55. 12; (50) Saṃjaya told
the grieving Dhṛtarāṣṭra that Pāṇḍavas and
Pāñcālas would (at the end of the war)
realize that the calamity was due to his fail-
ure to adopt the right course ({%tat te buddhi-%}
{%vyabhīcāram upalapsyanti … /pāñcālā … %})
7. 62. 7; (51) On the fourteenth day,
Pāñcālas fought a fierce battle with Kurus in
front of the {%vyūha%} of Droṇa; Droṇa and
many other kings on the side of Kauravas
checked the onward march of Pāñcālas;
when Kaurava army was being killed by
[Page770-b+ 40]
Pāṇḍavas, Droṇa scattered away Pāñcālas
with arrows 7. 70. 3, 13-14, 27; Pāñcāla
chariot-fighters saved Dhṛṣṭadyumna from
the attack of Droṇa 7. 72. 35; Dhṛtarāṣṭra
asked Saṃjaya what did the Pāñcālas do
when in their attempt to get close to Arjuna,
they were checked by Droṇa ({%bhāradvājena%}
{%saṃvṛtāḥ%}); Saṃjaya told him that in
the afternoon of that day Kurus and
Pāñcālas fought each other with Droṇa
as the bet ({%aparāhṇe mahārāja saṃgrā-%}
{%me … /pāñcālānāṃ kurūṇāṃ ca droṇe%}
{%dyūtam avartata //%}); Pāñcālas, wanting
to kill Droṇa showered arrows on him;
in the fierce battle, Pāñcālas, wanting to
break the army, used important missiles
({%tadanīkaṃ bibhitsanto mahāstrāṇi vyadar-%}
{%śayan%}) 7. 81. 1-5; demon Alambusa made
a river of blood flow carrying away
(dead) Pāñcālas 7. 83. 30; Droṇa killed
twentyfive Pāñcāla warriors, known as great
chariot-fighters and honoured by Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna ({%mahārathasamākhyātā dhṛṣṭa-%}
{%dyumnasya saṃmatāḥ%}); he killed choice
Pāñcāla warriors ({%pāñcālānāṃ … varān%}
{%varān%}) 7. 85. 28-29; when Droṇa defeated
hundreds and thousands of Pāñcālas and
killed many of them there went up a cry (of
grief) ({%teṣām samabhavac chabdo vadhya-%}
{%tāṃ droṇasāyakaiḥ%}) 7. 85. 31-32; gods, Gan-
dharvas and others who were watching the
battle pointed out to one another the runn-
ing away Pāñcālas 7. 85. 33; in the absence
of Sātyaki, Yudhiṣṭhira was to be prote-
cted by Pāñcālas and others 7. 86. 45;
Pāñcālas, when they faced Kṛtavarman,
were attacked by him; hence they lost enthu-
siasm ({%vigatotsāhāḥ%}); but soon, like noble
men, were ready to fight again desirous
of attaining great fame ({%atiṣṭhann ārya-%}

57-59 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 7. 113. 67: {%āryavat%}
{%kulīnavat kulīnatvād iti yāvat%}); when
defeated by Kṛtavarman they fled hither and
thither 7. 90. 47-48; Dhṛtarāṣṭra wanted to
know how Pāñcālas fought with Droṇa;
both were deeply inimical to each other
and Pāñcālas desired victory for Yudhi-
ṣṭhira 7. 89. 41; Droṇa, having seen that his
{%vyūha%} was put into disorder by Pāṇḍavas
and Pāñcālas, endeavoured to put it into
order; he succeeded in pushing back
Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas 7. 93. 35; brave
Pāñcālas and Pāṇḍavas rushed from all
sides on Droṇa to kill him 7. 97. 51; Duḥśā-
sana had formed great enmity with Pāñcā-
las 7. 98. 4; Droṇa hastened moderately to-
wards Pāñcālas ({%javam āsthāya madhya-%}
{%mam%}) and put them to flight; announcing
his name while fighting ({%nāma viśrāvya%}
{%saṃyuge%}) he killed many of them 7. 98. 24-
26; Pāñcālas covered Droṇa from all sides
when he was checked by Vīraketu; they
showered Droṇa with fiery arrows, costly
Tomaras ({%tomaraiś ca mahādhanaiḥ%}) and
various other weapons; Droṇa broke their
arrows 7. 98. 30-32; Pāñcālas shouted that
Droṇa would surrender to their king ({%vaśam%}
{%eṣyati no rājñaḥ%}) 7. 98. 55; when the horses
of Dhṛṣṭadyumna's chariot ran in all
directions, Droṇa forced Pāñcālas to run
away; defeating them Droṇa put his {%vyūha%}
in order ({%svaṃ vyūhaṃ punar āsthāya%}) 7.
98. 57-58; when Duryodhana challenged
Yudhiṣṭhira, Pāñcālas rushed towards
him; Droṇa checked their advance 7.
100. 36-38; Dhṛṣṭaketu wanted to attack
Droṇa who was killing Pāñcāla army 7.
101. 23; Pāñcālas trembled ({%samakam-%}
{%panta%}) as they were getting killed by
[Page771-b+ 40]
Droṇa 7. 101. 47, 53; the great fighters of
Pāñcālas were as though held at their thighs
by Droṇa ({%ūrugrāhagṛhītā hi pāñcālānāṃ%}

Cekitāna's charioteer was killed, Pāñcālas
were afraid; Droṇa made them run away
7. 101. 67-68; when Pāñcāla army was
reduced in number by Droṇa, Yudhiṣṭhira
did not know who could go to save them
7. 102. 3-4; when the {%vyūhas%} of Pāṇḍavas
were put into disorder, Pāñcālas and
Pārthas went back a long way ({%vyūheṣv%}

to help Arjuna, Pāñcālas followed him 7.
102. 67: Droṇa wanted to remain at his
place to check the advancing Pāñcālas 7.
105. 21; Dhṛtarāṣṭra told Saṃjaya that if
ever Pāñcālas were to fight with Bhīma
they would not be able to protect their
lives ({%na bhīmamukhasaṃprāpto mucyeteti%}

7. 110. 22-23; Duryodhana pointed out
to Droṇa, Śikhaṇḍin who led the Pāñcāla
army 7. 125. 11; he told Droṇa that
either he would kill Pāñcālas and Pāṇḍa-
vas or else get killed by them 7. 125. 25;
Droṇa felt himself sinking in the sin of
Dhṛṣṭadyumna since he had not yet killed
him, Śikhaṇḍin and Pāñcālas ({%majjantam%}
{%iva cātmānaṃ dhṛṣṭadyumnasya kilbiṣe%});
he could not take off his armour until he
had killed Pāñcālas 7. 126. 25, 32; (52)
In the fierce battle that was fought during
the night between fourteenth and fifteenth
day the reporters on the battlefield like
Saṃjaya could distinguish the Pāñcālas from
[Page772-a+ 40]
Kurus only by hearing their personal names
and the names of their respective {%gotras%}
and families ({%gotrānāṃ nāmadheyānāṃ%}
{%kulānāṃ caiva tuāriṣa / śravaṇād dhi%}
{%vijānīmaḥ pāñcālān kurubhiḥ saha //%});
Pāñcālas fled in all directions when
they were being killed by Duryodhana
7. 128. 2, 8, 17; at that time Pāñcālas led
by Bhīma attacked Duryodhana; when
deeply wounded, Duryodhana sat down in
his chariot, Pāñcālas felt he was dead and
delightfully they raised a loud cry 7. 128.
21, 23; when Duryodhana attacked Yudhi-
ṣṭhira, Pāñcālas advanced towards him;
Droṇa faced them 7. 128. 33; Drupada,
protected by Pāñcālas turned towards
Droṇa; six thousand Pāñcālas, led by Śikha-
ṇḍin, rushed towards Droṇa 7. 129. 8, 10;
Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya when Droṇa,
after the death of Jayadratha and Bhūriśra-
vas, attacked Pāñcālas, what did Arjuna
do ? when Droṇa entered the Pāñcāla army,
how was he (later) killed ? 7. 130. 3, 7;
when Droṇa used Vāyavyāstra, Pāñcālas
ran away due to fear; but when Bhīma
and Arjuna invaded the Kaurava army,
Pāñcālas followed them 7. 132. 38, 41;
Karṇa asked Duryodhana to save the
Kaurava warriors attacked on all sides by
Pāñcālas and others; Pāñcāla chariot-
fighters, feeling victorious and delighted,
were making loud sound; he assured
Duryodhana that he would kill Pāñcālas
who had come forward to fight 7. 133. 3,
4, 6, 11; the victorious Pāñcālas raised a
cry seeing Karṇa engaged in battle with
Pāṇḍavas; Duryodhana asked his army to
stand still for he was going to kill the atta-
cking Pāñcālas; he also requested Aśva-
tthāman to kill Pāñcālas since they, feeling
[Page772-b+ 39]
victorious, moved in the Kaurava army
like forest-fire; Aśvatthāman was born for
killing Pāñcālas and make the world devoid
of them; that was declared by the Siddhas,
and it was bound to be true ({%kariṣyasi%}
{%jagat sarvam apāñcālaṃ kilācyuta / evaṃ%}
{%siddhābruvan vāco bhaviṣyati ca tat%}
{%tathā / %}); Pāñcālas would not be able to
withstand the {%astras%} of Aśvatthāman 7.
134. 11, 54, 76-77, 79-81; Aśvatthāman
assured Duryodhana that he would fight
with Pāñcālas for Duryodhana's delight;
they would run away in all directions when
burnt down by his arrows; when Yudhiṣṭhira
would see Pāñcālas dead, he would be
dejected; Aśvatthāman then challenged Pāñ-
cālas to steady themselves and fight with
him; he asked their great chariot-fighters
to strike him showing their skill in the use
of {%astras (praharadhvam itaḥ sarve mama%}
{%gātre mahārathāḥ / sthirībhūtāś ca yudhya-%}
{%dhvaṃ darśayanto 'stralāghavam //);%} when
addressed, Pāñcālas showered weapons
(arrows ?) on Aśvatthāman ({%śastravṛṣṭim%}
{%apātayan%}); Aśvatthāman repulsed the
arrows and killed ten heroes in the
presence of Pāṇḍavas and Dhṛṣtadyumna;
when Pāñcālas were getting killed, they
ran away in all directions; seeing that,
Dhṛṣṭadyumna rushed at Aśvatthāman; in
the duel that ensued, Dhṛṣṭadyumna was
covered on all sides by the entire Pāñcāla
army; Aśvatthāman, by his well-joined
arrows, forced hundreds and thousands of
Pāñcālas to flee ({%bāṇaiḥ saṃnataparva-%}
{%bhiḥ%}); he killed a hundred Pāñcālas with
a hundred arrows ({%śatena ca śataṃ hatvā%}),
and three great chariot-fighters with three
sharp arrows ({%tribhiś ca niśitair bāṇair%}
{%hatvā trīn vai mahārathān%}); he thus killed
[Page773-a+ 40]
a large number of those Pāñcālas who
were prepared for fight ({%nāśayām āsa%}
{%pāñcālān bhūyiṣṭhaṃ ye vyavasthitāḥ%});
Pāñcālas, thus getting killed, left Aśvatthā-
man and went away with their chariots
and banners shattered; Aśvatthāman having
defeated his enemies, uttered a loud roar 7.
135. 10, 11, 13; 16-21; 36, 47, 49-52;
Droṇa used {%vāyavyāstra%} against Pāñcālas;
getting killed, they ran away; when Bhīma
and Arjuna attacked the left and the right
flank respectively ({%bībhatsur dakṣiṇaṃ%}
{%pārśvam uttaraṃ tu vṛkodaraḥ%}), great
chariot-fighters among Pāñcālas followed
them; Droṇa blew away ({%vyadhamat%}) the
Pāṇḍava army and Pāñcālas at the start of
the night ({%rajanīmukhe%}) 7. 136. 11, 14; 7.
137. 51; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya, when
Droṇa entered the Pāñcāla army and
burnt their hosts of chariots who prote-
cted him on all the four sides 7. 139. 12-14;
when Pāñcālas and Kauravas killed one
another they raised a fierce sound ({%āsīn%}
{%niṣṭānako ghoro nighnatām itaretaram%}) 7.
139. 32; Yudhiṣṭhira asked Pāñcālas and
others to attack Droṇa to kill him; then,
raising fearful cries they attacked him 7.
140. 2-3; when Aśvatthāman swooned
while fighting with Ghaṭotkaca, Pāñcālas
raised a loud roar 7. 141. 32; when Duryo-
dhana, while fighting with Bhīma, lost his
charioteer and horses, he was considered
dead; Pāñcālas then attacked Droṇa 7. 141.
60; after defeating Sahadeva, Karṇa turned
towards Pāñcālas 7. 142. 16; when Śikha-
ṇḍin was defeated by Kṛpa. Pāñcālas
covered him on all sides 7. 144. 27; they
also covered him when he attacked Droṇa
7. 145. 3; in the great battle that followed
between the two heroes, Pāñcālas also
[Page773-b+ 40]
took part 7. 145. 68; when Sātyaki and
Duryodhana were engaged in battle, there
was confused and fierce fighting between
Bhāratas and Pāñcālas ({%tataḥ samabhavad%}
{%yuddham ākulam … /pāñcālānāṃ ca sarve-%}
{%ṣāṃ bhāratānāṃ ca dāruṇam //%}) 7. 146. 17;
incited by Duryodhana, Droṇa fought
fiercely and started killing Pāñcālas; then
they raised a tumultuous cry; when they
were broken and shattered, dejected Kṛṣṇa
pointed out to Arjuna their plight 7. 147.
15, 22-23; he advised Arjuna to assist
their great chariot-fighters, as well as Bhīma,
to give encouragement to the entire army
({%āśvāsanārthaṃ sarveṣāṃ sainyānām%}) 7.
147. 29; Karṇa oppressed the great chariot-
fighters among Pāñcālas ({%pāñcālānāṃ%}
{%mahārathān / abhyapīḍayat%}); pressed hard
by Karṇa, the large Pāñcāla army ran away
({%sā pīḍyamānā tu karṇena pāñcālānāṃ%}
{%mahācamūḥ / saṃprādravat susaṃtrastā%});
their warriors fell down from horses, ele-
phants and chariots; Karṇa cut off their
hands, heads and thighs; Droṇa assisted
him 7. 148. 9-19; Kṛṣṇa pointed out to
Ghaṭotkaca their plight 7. 148. 45; Pāñcālas,
smiling, watched the battle between Karṇa
and Ghaṭotkaca 7. 152. 5; Pāñcālas,
oppressed excessively by Alāyudha, had no
peace of mind ({%na śāntiṃ lebhire tatra … %}
{%bhṛśapīḍitāḥ%}) 7. 152. 31; Karṇa forced
the Pāñcāla {%mahārathas%} to run away;
then they fought with Droṇa; they raised
a loud roar when Alāyudha was killed by
Ghaṭotkaca 7. 153. 8, 10, 33; Karṇa attack-
ed Pāñcālas led by Dhṛṣṭadyumna and
Śikhaṇḍin 7. 154. 3-4; Saṃjaya told
Dhṛtarāṣṭra that every night Duryodhana
asked Karṇa to kill next day Arjuna (or
Kṛṣṇa) with his {%śakti%} so that the Pāñ-
[Page774-a+ 40]
cālas could be ruled as if they were
servants ({%preṣyavat pāṇḍupāñcālān upa-%}
{%bhokṣyāmahe tataḥ%})—Pāñcālas who were
like the leaves of a tree in the form of
the Pāṇḍavas ({%pāñcālāḥ patrasaṃjñitāḥ%})
7. 157. 19-22; Dhṛtarāṣṭra was curious to
know how the Sṛñjayas and Pāñcālas who,
armed and in battle-arrays ({%vyūḍhānīkāḥ%}
{%prahāriṇaḥ%}) fought with Droṇa when they
attacked him (7. 158. 13); when, Yudhi-
ṣṭhira after the death of Ghaṭotkaca started
to fight with Kauravas, Pāñcālas armed
for battle ({%daṃśitāḥ%}) beat {%bheris%} and
blew conches 7. 158. 50; Droṇa vowed
that he would take off his armour only
after he had killed Pāñcālas 7. 160. 12;
towards the end of the night war, Droṇa
divided his army into two parts and,
led by Duryodhana, attacked Pāñcālas;
they were specifically afflicted by the arrows
of Droṇa; yet, although suffering from
excessive pain, Pāñcālas continued to
fight ({%pāñcālās tu viśeṣeṇa droṇasāyaka-%}
{%pīḍitāḥ / samasajjanta rājendra samare%}
{%bhṛśavedanāḥ%}) 7. 161. 3, 28; when Droṇa
killed Virāṭa, Drupada, and other warriors
of Pāñcālas, Dhṛṣṭadyumna cursed the
Pāñcāla warriors who would let Droṇa
remain alive or turn away from him;
Pāñcālas then attacked Droṇa, but they
could not even look at Droṇa although
they tried, protected as he was by Duryo-
dhana and others ({%yatamānāpi pāñcālā%}
{%na śekuḥ parivīkṣitum%}) 7. 161. 35-37, 38,
40; (53) On the fifteenth day, when the
large armies of Kauravas and Pāñcālas
clashed with one another, everything
was in turmoil and nothing was quite
clear ({%āvignam abhavat sarvam … na%}
{%prājñāyata kiṃcana%}); in the raised dust
[Page774-b+ 40]
it was difficult to know who were Kaura-
veyas and who Pāñcālas 7. 162. 22, 27-28;
during the duel between Karṇa and Bhīma,
Yudhiṣṭhira addressed the chief heroes of
Pāñcālas and urged them to go and help the
chief warriors of Pāṇḍavas ({%pāñcālānāṃ%}
{%naravyāghrān … tatra gacchata yatraite%}
{%yudhyante māmakā rathāḥ%}); Pāñcālas, thus
urged, divided their army into four parts
({%caturdhā vāhinīṃ kṛtvā%}): a part hit
Droṇa with arrows; others, led by Bhīma,
covered him from another side ({%pāñcā-%}
{%lās tv ekato droṇam abhyaghnan bahubhiḥ%}
{%śaraiḥ / bhīmasenapurogāś ca ekataḥ parya-%}
{%vārayan // %}); Arjuna was urged to separate
Kurus from Droṇa; then Pāñcālas would
kill Droṇa whose protectors were slain; but
Droṇa attacked Pāñcālas and killed them;
however, they continued to attack Droṇa;
as they were getting killed a fearful sound
was raised by them; when Pāñcālas were
thus getting killed, Pāṇḍavas were afraid
and they lost hope of victory ({%vadhya-%}

{%bhayam āviśat / … nāśaṃsur vijayaṃ tadā //%})
7. 164. 48-54, 56-58, 60-63; after the
false news of Aśvatthāman's death twenty
thousand Pāñcāla principal heroes ({%nara-%}
{%rṣabhāḥ%}) showered arrows from all sides on
Droṇa; he then used {%brahmāstra%} to kill
Pāñcālas; with that missile he cut off their
heads and large arms adorned with gold
ornaments ({%tathaiva parighākārān bāhūn%}
{%kanakabhūṣaṇān%}) and killed twenty thou-
sand Pāñcāla chariot-fighters ({%viṃśati-%}
{%sāhasrān pāñcālānāṃ rathavrajān%}) 7. 164.
78-83; that day Kauravas, led by Droṇa,
had started fighting only with Pāñcālas
({%pāñcālair eva kevalaiḥ%}), and when Droṇa
released the {%brahmāstra,%} especially Pāñcālas
[Page775-a+ 40]
were killed ({%pāñcālāś ca viśeṣataḥ / … vyana-%}
{%śan%}); when their armies were thus thrashed,
Pāñcālas, (though) angered, turned away
from battle ({%amarṣavaśam āpannāḥ pāñcālā%}
{%vimukhābhavan%}) 7. 165. 98, 100-101, 104;
Droṇa killed hosts of chariot-fighters of
Pāñcālas but was killed 8. 4. 5; (54) After
the death of Droṇa, Aśvatthāman assured
Duryodhana that he would try to kill
Pāñcālas by all sorts of means, whether
soft or harsh ({%sarvopāyāir … karmaṇā%}
{%yena teneha mṛdunā dāruṇena vā%}); only
after killing Pāñcālas he would have peace
of mind; he would force Pāñcālas to run
away by the use of Nārāyaṇāstra 7. 166.
28-29, 52; Sahadeva, in order to pacify
Sātyaki, told him that the Pāṇḍavas had
no allies other than Andhakas, Vṛṣṇis and
Pāñcālas; similarly the Pāñcālas had no
allies other than Pāṇḍavas and Vṛṣṇis 7.
169. 48, 50; when, after the death of Droṇa,
Kauravas and Pāṇḍava-Pāñcālas became
ready to fight, Aśvatthāman aimed his
Nārāyaṇāstra against the Pāṇḍavas and
Pāñcālas; Yudhiṣṭhira, afraid of the effects
produced by the {%astra,%} asked Dhṛṣṭadyu-
mna to run away with Pāñcāla army; he
also remembered that Pāñcālas. led by
Satyajit and making effort for his victory,
were totally destroyed by Droṇa ({%pāñcālāḥ%}
{%satyajinmukhāḥ / kurvāṇā majjaye yatnaṃ%}
{%samūlā vinipātitāḥ%}) 7. 170. 10, 15, 26, 34;
Duryodhana urged Aśvatthāman to use
Nārāyaṇāstra again when Pāficālas, wishing
victory, had steadied themselves ({%vyavasthitā%}
{%hi pāñcālāḥ punar eva jayaiṣiṇaḥ%}); Aśva-
tthāman told him his inability to do that
but he forced Pāñcālas to run away wound-
ing them with arrows; when Aśvatthāman
succeeded in killing many prominent
[Page775-b+ 40]
(Pāñcāla) heroes on the side of Pāṇḍavas
he blew his large conch with delight;
hearing that all Pāñcālas, and even Bhīma,
ran in all directions leaving Dhṛṣṭadyumna
behind 7. 171. 25, 45, 67; (55) Saṃjaya,
summarizing the events between the death
of Droṇa and that of Karṇa, told Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra that Duryodhana assured his army
that they would be witnesses to the heroism
of Karṇa and Aśvatthāman against the
Pāñcālas; Karṇa killed and afflicted many
Pāñcālas, but was ultimately killed by
Arjuna 8. 2. 15, 18, 20; 8. 5. 30; Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra remembered that Karṇa had once be-
fore defeated Pāñcālas and made them pay
tribute ({%ajaiṣīt … pāñcālāṃś ca … cakre%}
{%balibhṛtaḥ purā%}) 8. 5. 18-20 (reference
to Karṇa's conquests before the Vaiṣṇava
sacrifice of Duryodhana 3. 241. 29, 32; 3.
App. I. 24. 28-34); (56) On the sixteenth
day, Duryodhana requested Karṇa to lead
the Kaurava army because when Pāñcālas
would see him they would run away;
Pāṇḍavas together with Pāñcālas would be
disheartened on seeing Karṇa ready to
fight ({%pāṇḍavā gatacetasaḥ … pāñcālaiḥ%}
{%saha%}); the bards urged Karṇa to kill
Pāñcālas and bring victory to Kauravas;
they also said that Pāñcālas would not be
able to withstand Karṇa ready with his
arms 8. 6. 30-31, 40, 42; Pāñcālas and
others rushed at the Kaurava army; their
chariot-fighters, elephant-riders and impor-
tant foot-soldiers, delighted, danced and
laughed making different sounds ({%nānā-%}
{%vidharavair hṛṣṭā nṛtyanti ca hasanti ca%})
8. 8. 19-20; Karṇa put to death twenty
Pāñcāla chariot-fighters along with their
horses and charioteers and felled down
their banners; he also killed many other
[Page776-a+ 40]
Pāñcālas; then Pāñcāla princes ({%? pāñcāla-%}
{%putrāś ca%}) attacked Karṇa 8. 16. 16, 22-23;
heroes from the east and south, skilled
in elephant-warfare, showered arrows,
{%tomaras%} and {%nārācas%} on Pāñcālas; Pāñcā-
las, with sharp weapons, surrounded the
elephants and showered arrows on them;
they covered Nakula to protect him from
those who were fighting from elephants;
Karṇa, after defeating Nakula, turned
towards Pāñcālas; Pāṇḍavas raised a loud
cry seeing Karṇa approach Pāñcāla
chariot-fighters ({%dṛṣṭvā senāpatiṃ yāntaṃ%}
{%pāñcālānāṃ rathavrajān%} 8. 17. 99); their
chariots then were carried away (by horses)
with or without the charioteers and
their axles broken; those Pāñcāla {%mahā-%}
{%rathas%} who survived began to run away;
Karṇa, showering arrows, persecuted Pāñ-
cālas whose armours and banners were
broken and tormented them with arrows 8.
17. 7, 21, 98-99, 101, 119-120; Ulūka, after
defeating Yuyutsu, turned towards Pāñcālas
striking them with arrows 8. 18. 11; when
Yudhiṣṭhira fought a duel with Duryo-
dhana, Pāñcālas attacked Kauravas making
sounds ({%kṣveḍāḥ kilakilāśābdāḥ%}) and
striking thousands of {%tūryas;%} men fought
against men, elephants against elephants,
chariots against chariot-fighters and horses
against horse-riders; those duels were for
a while pleasing to watch ({%dvandvāny āsan%}
{%mahārāja prekṣaṇīyāni saṃyuge; muhūr-%}
{%tam eva tad yuddham āsīn madhuradarśa-%}
{%nam%}); all fought the battle according to the
rules; nobody struck the opponent from
behind ({%anyonyaṃ samare jaghnur yodha-%}
{%vratam anuṣṭhitāḥ / na hi te samaraṃ cakruḥ%}
{%pṛṣthato vai kathaṃcana //%}) 8. 19. 45-49;
but later the battle was fought disregarding
[Page776-b+ 40]
the proper norms; the battle described
in 8. 19. 49 ff.; Karṇa killed Pāñcālas 8. 19.
74; (57) On the seventeenth day, Duryo-
dhana wanted Karṇa and Śalya together
to kill Pāṇḍavas along with Pāñcālas and
Sṛñjayas 8. 23. 15; Karṇa asked Śalya to
drive his chariot to Pāñcālas and others;
either he would kill them or they would
kill him; Śalya pointed out to Karṇa that
the banners and the chariots of Pāñcālas
were making sound ({%dhvajāḥ kaṇakaṇā-%}
{%yante … sapatākā rathāś cāpi pāñcālānām%})
8. 31. 51; a fierce battle broke out between
Pāñcālas and Kauravas; Duryodhana
protected Karṇa fighting with Pāñcālas and
other heroes; Karṇa rushed towards
Dhṛṣṭadyumna and Pāñcālas who rushed
at him; Karṇa killed twentyfive Pāñcāla
warriors with equal number of arrows;
hosts of Pāñcāla chariot-fighters then
surrounded Karṇa; Karṇa killed with five
arrows five Pāñcāla prominent warriors viz.
Bhānudeva, Citrasena, Senābindu, Tapana
and Śūrasena; then there was a loud cry
of anger among the Pāñcālas ({%hāhākāro%}
{%mahān āsīt pāñcālānāṃ mahāhave%}); but
Pāñcālas, equipped ({%daṃśitāḥ%}), attacked
Karṇa 8. 32. 15, 20, 25-26, 33, 35-38,
43; they checked the advance of Karṇa; he
could not break through their resistance
to reach Yudhiṣṭhira; when he reached
Yudhiṣṭhira and defeated him the latter
turned back and Pāñcālas followed him 8.
33. 7, 9, 15, 41; Pāñcālas and others gathered
together and, disregarding the terrible fear
of death ({%tyaktvā mṛtyubhayaṃ ghoram%}),
attacked Aśvatthāman 8. 39. 10; Karṇa
killed Pāñcālas by thousands 8. 40. 4-5;
when he attacked them, no one of them
turned back; they attacked Karṇa from all
[Page777-a+ 40]
sides; he moved among them unafraid;
he made hosts of their chariot-fighters run
away 8. 40. 42, 44, 58-59; Karṇa, single-
handed, announcing his name ({%viśrāvya%}
{%nāma%}) killed many Pāñcālas, respected by
brave ({%śūrasaṃmatāḥ%}); onlookers like
Saṃjaya felt that no Pāñcāla warrior
would be allowed to live by Karṇa; Karṇa,
while blowing away Pāñcālas ({%vidhaman%}),
rushed towards Yudhiṣṭhira; he, alone,
fought with Cedis, Pāñcālas and Pāṇḍavas
8. 40. 62-64, 68; Pāñcālas, led by Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna, followed Bhīma and returned to
battle ({%tam ete 'nu nivartante%}) 8. 41. 3;
Karṇa, alone, held back Pāñcālas and
others; when Pāñcālas saw that Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna was saved by Arjuna, they, consi-
dering themselves victorious, sounded
musical instruments by thousands and
made loud roar 8. 42. 32, 54-55; Pāñcālas
quickly rallied round Yudhiṣṭhira to help
him; in the presence of Pāñcālas and
others, Karṇa broke the banner on the
chariot of Yudhiṣṭhira; he destroyed the
army of Pāṇḍavas (including Pāñcālas);
Pāñcālas started to run away; Karṇa had
already defeated them; it was felt that Karṇa
attacking them would extirpate Pāñcālas
({%samucchetsyati%}); but when Bhīma appear-
ed, Pāñcālas started killing Kaurava army
8. 43. 3, 22-29, 31-32, 50, 53; chariot-
fighters ({%rathinaḥ%}) of Kauravas, struck
by Pāñcālas, fell down from their chariots;
Pāñcālas returned towards the army of
Kauravas ({%dhārtarāṣṭrān%}) and killed those
who, riding elephants, horses and chariots,
were fighting; supported by Bhīma, Pāñcālas
disregarded their lives and crushed their
enemies; while killing their adversaries,
they blew conches and shouted; when the
[Page777-b+ 40]
Pāñcālas were thus killing the Kaurava
army, Kṛpa, Karṇa and other heroes made
great attempt to stop their attack 8. 43.
59-65; but Pāñcālas, enraged and feeling
victorious, attacked the Kaurava army
from all sides 8. 44. 8; Karṇa assured Śalya
that he would kill all Pāñcālas and Pāṇḍa-
vas and then released his Bhārgavāstra
against them; Pāñcālas, afflicted by that
missile, raised a loud cry ({%hāhākāro mahān%}
{%āsīt pāñcālānām … %}); getting killed by the
missile Pāñcālas were all confused ({%tatra%}
{%tatra vyamuhyanta%}) 8. 45. 32, 37, 41; Karṇa
cut off the banner of Yudhiṣṭhira and killed
his two side-charioteers in the presence of
Pāñcālas ({%hatau ca pārṣṇisārathī%}) 8.
46. 12; Kṛṣṇa told Arjuna: all Pāñcālas,
under Arjuna's guidance, were ready to
fight; protected by him, they had killed
enemies; Bhīṣma had earlier killed Pāñcālas;
Arjuna now should kill the enemies, viz.
the five great warriors Aśvatthāman, Kṛta-
varman, Karṇa, Śalya and Kṛpa, so that
Pāñcālas might rejoice ({%adya modantu pāñ-%}
{%cālā … %}); Pāñcālas wished to rescue Pāṇḍa-
vas ({%pāṇḍavān ujjihīrṣavaḥ%}) but were fleeing
as they got killed by Karṇa; they were as
good as under the control of Karṇa ({%viddhi%}
{%karṇavaśaṃ gatān%}); Pāñcālas, struck by
Karṇa, raised a fierce cry ({%śrūyate ninado%}
{%ghoras … %}); when they faced Bhīṣma, they
never turned back ({%nāsan parāṅmukhāḥ%});
they would not turn back due to fear of
Karṇa; Karṇa was killing the attacking
Pāñcālas by hundreds — Pāñcālas who
gave lives for their friends; Pāñcālas were
fleeing in all directions ({%ete caranti pāñcālā%}
{%dikṣu sarvāsu%}) as they faced the irresisti-
ble {%astra%} of Karṇa obtained by him from
Bhārgava (8. 51. 101); if Karṇa was
[Page778-a+ 40]
neglected ({%upekṣitaḥ karṇo … %}); he would
kill Pāñcālas and the rest 8. 51. 5-6, 12, 27,
54, 91-96, 98-100, 104, 106; Arjuna saw
Pāñcāla army running away; he desired to
pay back the debt he owed to Pāñcālas
by killing Karṇa ({%pāñcālānāṃ ca mādhava /%}
{%adyānṛṇyaṃ gamiṣyāmi%}) 8. 52. 5, 28; as
desired by Karṇa, Śalya drove his chariot
towards Pāñcālas; entering their army,
Śalya stopped Karṇa's chariot wherever
he desired; seeing Karṇa's chariot, the
Pāñcālas trembled ({%trastā āsan%}); when
Karṇa killed Pāñcālas a loud cry arose
among them ({%tatrākrando mahān āsīt%});
although the great Pāñcāla archers were
defeated, they returned to fight till death
({%mṛtyuṃ kṛtvā nivartanam%}); Karṇa killed
twentyfive chariot-fighters and more than
hundred horse-riders; the wonderful
heroism of Pāñcālas was witnessed by
others when Pāñcālas did not abandon
fighting although they were getting killed
({%tatrādbhutam apaśyāma pāñcālānāṃ%}
{%parākramam / vadhyamānāpi karṇena%}
{%nājahū raṇamūrdhani //%}); two sons (not
named) of Karṇa killed strong Pāñcālas
8. 56. 8-11, 23, 31, 47, 49, 54, 56; but
at one stage Pāñcālas, afraid of Karṇa,
began to flee ({%ete dravanti pāñcālāḥ karṇāt%}
{%trastā … %}) 8. 57. 3; Karṇa rushed towards
Pāñcālas in spite of Arjuna ({%paśyataḥ%}
{%savyasācinaḥ%}); he killed Pāñcālas by releas-
ing thousands of arrows; there was fierce
battle of Karṇa with Pāñcālas who were
getting killed while fighting for the sake
of their allies ({%vadhyatāṃ sūtaputreṇa%}
{%mitrārthe 'mitraghātināṃ%}) 8. 59. 42, 44-45;
Karṇa scattered away Pāñcāla princes
({%? pāñcālaputrān%}); Karṇa was making the
Pāṇḍava army devoid of Pāñcālas ({%apāñcā-%}
[Page778-b+ 40]
{%lyaṃ kriyate%}); then five senior Pāñcāla
chariot-fighters, Uttamaujas and others,
attacked Karṇa but were not able to fell
down Karṇa from his chariot; all of them
were hit by Karṇa with arrows after he cut
off their bows and banners and killed their
horses and chariots; all of them were
defeated by Karṇa; when they were rescued
by Draupadī's sons and Sātyaki, the five
chariot-fighters got other chariots and, well-
armed, they rallied round Sātyaki to
protect him 8. 60. 1, 10, 15-17, 21-22, 26;
Karṇa tormented Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas
by the lustre of his missiles ({%pratāpya%}
{% … astratejasā%}), but was thoroughly paci-
fied by the lustre of Arjuna (i. e. by
his missiles) ({%saṃśāntaḥ pārthatejasā%})
8. 68. 43; Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas honour-
ed Arjuna when Karṇa was killed 8. 69.
37; (58) In the evening of the seven-
teenth day Duryodhana told Śalya that
when he would be on the battle-field
Pāñcālas would give up all effort ({%nirudya-%}
{%māḥ%}) 9. 5. 24; Śalya, when chosen by
Duryodhana to lead his army, assured him
that he would kill all Pāñcālas in battle:
“let them see in battle my heroism, strength
of my arms and bow, my skill and power
of my missiles” ({%vikramaṃ mama paśyantu%}
{%dhanuṣaś ca mahad balam / lāghavaṃ%}
{%cāstravīryaṃ ca bhujayoś ca balaṃ yudhi //%})
9. 6. 11, 13-14; after listening to Kṛṣṇa's
advice, Yudhiṣṭhira permitted all Pāñcālas
to leave and he slept that night freed of
all care; all Pāñcālas too, delighted at
Karṇa's death, slept (happily) that night
9. 6. 38-40; (59) On the eighteenth day,
the victorious Pāñcālas went to the battle-
field 9. 7. 42; seeing Śalya's heroism, Duryo-
dhana felt Pāñcālas, Sṛṃjayas and Pāṇḍa-
[Page779-a+ 40]
vas as good as dead 9. 12. 28; having
heard Yudhiṣṭhira's vow to kill Śalya, all
Pāñcālas felt delighted; they blew conches,
beat {%bheris%} and {%puṣkaras%} by hundreds and
made loud roar in anticipation of the ful-
filment of the vow ({%tataḥ praharṣaḥ … punar%}
{%āsīt … pāñcālānāṃ … pratijñām tāṃ ca saṃ-%}
{%grāme dharmarājasya pūrayan%}) 9. 15. 27-
28; Pāñcālas and others, angered by Śalya's
killing their army, surrounded him 9. 16. 6;
when the Madra army, incited by Duryo-
dhana, entered the Pāṇḍava army, Pāñcālas
and others surrounded Yudhiṣṭhira wishing
his safety ({%yudhiṣṭhiraṃ parīpsantaḥ%});
Madra warriors shouted: “where are the
great warriors of Pāñcālas ({%pāñcālānāṃ%}
{%mahāvīryāḥ%}) 9. 17. 8, 13; when the Kau-
rava army fled after the death of Śalya,
Pāñcālas, desirous of victory, persecuted
them; seeing the Kaurava army, oppressed
by fear, running away, Pāñcālas and
Pāṇḍavas spoke to each other about the
victory of Yudhiṣṭhira and the defeat of
Duryodhana 9. 18. 11, 13-14; seeing Śālva's
heroism, Pāñcālas raised cries of despair
({%hāhākārair nādayantaḥ%}) and surrounded
his elephant 9. 19. 21; hearing the loud
roar of delighted Kauravas ({%siṃhanādaḥ%}
{%prahṛṣṭānāṃ … %}), Pāñcālas were dejected;
when Kṛtavarman and Sātyaki were engaged
in a duel, Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas acted as
spectators ({%prekṣakāḥ samapadyanta%});
when Kaurava army started running away
at the defeat of Kṛtavarman, Duryodhana
attacked Pāñcālas and halted them with
arrows 9. 20. 6-7, 11, 33-34; Pāṇḍavas,
helped by Pāñcālas, stopped the advance of
Kurus and killed their seven hundred
chariot-fighters; Yudhiṣṭhira asked Saha-
deva to kill Śakuni; he himself, along with
[Page779-b+ 40]
Pāñcālas, would guard the division of
chariots ({%rathānīkam ahaṃ rakṣye%}) 9. 22.
14, 34; (60) Aśvatthāman left the army of
Pāñcāla king ({%pāñcālarājasya tad anīkam,%}
i. e. Pāñcālas) and went to Śakuni 9. 24.
42; (61) Aśvatthāman assured Duryo-
dhana, who had hid himself in water, that
he would that very day kill all Pāñcālas,
or else he would not remove his armour; on
learning the whereabouts of Duryodhana,
when Pāṇḍavas started towards the lake,
the delighted Pāñcālas raised a loud roar
({%kilakilāśabdaḥ prādurāsīd … %}); those
Pāñcālas who survived the war of eighteen
days followed Pāṇḍavas to the lake ({%pāñ-%}
{%cālānāṃ ca ye śiṣṭāḥ%}) 9. 29. 21, 46, 52:
Duryodhana even in that condition wished
to destroy the enthusiasm of Pāñcālas 9. 30.
43; Duryodhana was not afraid of either
Pāṇḍavas or Pāñcālas; with mace in his
hand he was confident to defeat them in
battle; equipped with mace, he appeared
to Pāñcālas like Indra with his {%vajra%} or
Śiva with his {%śūla;%} Pāñcālas and other
Pāṇḍava warriors clapped each other's
palms ({%anyonyasya talān daduḥ%}); Duryo-
dhana considered that to be his insult;
angered, he said that he would send Pāṇḍa-
vas and Pāñcālas to the abode of Yama
9. 31. 13, 30, 40-44; Pāñcālas welcomed
the decision of Bhīma to fight with Duryo-
dhana and kill him ({%tad vaco bhīmasena-%}
{%sya sarva evābhyapūjayan%}) 9. 32. 27; hear-
ing Duryodhana's challenging words, they
also applauded him ({%saṃpūjayām āsus%}
{%tad vacaḥ%}) 9. 32. 50; seeing the bad omens
which occurred at the time of the down-
fall of Duryodhana, Pāñcālas were dejected
({%āvignamanasaḥ%}) 9. 57. 57; they were not
very happy when Balarāma, displeased
[Page780-a+ 40]
with the way Duryodhana was made to
lie low, left for Dvārakā ({%nātipramanaso%}
{%'bhavan%}) 9. 59. 27; when Duryodhana
fell down, Pāñcālas, delighted ({%prahṛṣṭa-%}
{%manasaḥ%}), threw up their upper garments
and made roaring sounds; some expressed
their joy by stretching their bows, others
by sounding bow-strings; some blew big
conches and still others beat {%dundubhis;%}
some made sportive gestures and laughed
({%cikrīḍuś ca tathaivānye jaharṣuś ca%}); they
said many things in praise of Bhīmasena
9. 60. 3-16; hearing that, Kṛṣṇa rebuked
them 9. 60. 17-18; hearing Kṛṣṇa's words
reassuring Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas for the
means they adopted to defeat Kauravas,
Pāñcālas were very much delighted; they
roared like herds of lions ({%bhṛśasaṃhṛṣṭā%}
{%vineduḥ siṃhasaṃghavat%}); Aśvatthāman
assured Duryodhana that he would kill
all Pāñcālas with all sorts of means in the
very presence of Kṛṣṇa ({%sarvopāyair hi%}
{%neṣyāmi pretarājaniveśanam%}) 9. 64. 35;
(a reference to this incident in 1. 2. 180);
(62) References to what happened during
the night of the eighteenth day are found
at the beginning of the Śalyaparvan: (i)
Vaiśaṃpāyana told Janamejaya that during
that night the three heroes on the side of
Kauravas who survived the war ({%hataśiṣṭās%}
{%trayo rathāḥ%}) killed the entire Pāñcāla
army; that was told by Saṃjaya to Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra 9. 1. 13, 30; (ii) Dhṛtarāṣṭra remem-
bered that Duryodhana had assured him
that he would kill all Pāñcālas; he then
asked Saṃjaya to tell him how all Pāñcā-
las, together with foot-soldiers, were killed
({%pāñcālāś ca yathā sarve nihatāḥ sapadā-%}
{%nugāḥ%}) 9. 2. 22, 63; (63) In the night
of the eighteenth day Aśvatthāman re-
[Page780-b+ 40]
solved to kill Pāñcālas when they were
asleep; he told Kṛpa that Pāñcālas, tired
due to exertion, would sleep that night
delightfully, trustfully, feeling themselves
victorious, unyoking their horses and keep-
ing away their armours; he would storm
Pāñcālas in their camp to kill them with his
sword and then get peace of mind; he would
repay the debt he owed to his father by
killing Pāñcālas; by killing the Pāñcāla army
at night he will have done his duty and
feel happy 10. 1. 53; 10. 3. 25, 28-32, 34-
35; earlier when Bhīma had stepped on
Duryodhana's head, Pāñcālas growled,
laughed, blew conches and sounded
{%dundubhis%} 10. 1. 58-59; Kṛpa told Aśva-
tthāman that they should kill Pāñcālas next
day in battle; Aśvatthāman was quite
capable of defeating the Pāñcāla army while
fighting with them; they would return
from the battle-field only after killing the
wretched Pāñcālas or get themselves killed
10. 4. 4, 15, 18; but Aśvatthāman was un-
able to live even for a while since he had
heard Pāñcālas saying: “Droṇa was
killed”; they deserved to be killed by him
10. 4. 25-26; Kṛpa tried to dissuade Aśva-
tthāman by telling him that it would not
be proper to kill Pāñcālas when they were
trustfully asleep 10. 5. 11; but Aśvatthā-
man asked Kṛpa why he did not blame
Pāñcālas who had committed sin by not
following {%dharma%} and broken all norms
of life ({%evam adhārmikāḥ pāpāḥ pāñcālā%}
{%bhinnasetavaḥ%}); he had therefore decided
to kill them during their sleep 10. 5. 24-
25; Mahādeva told Aśvatthāman that he
formerly protected Pāñcālas only out of
regard for Kṛṣṇa; but now they were over-
powered by Kāla and did not deserve to live
[Page781-a+ 40]
({%abhibhūtās tu kālena naiṣām adyāsti%}
{%jīvitam%}) 10. 7. 63; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked
Saṃjaya whether Kṛpa and Kṛtavarman
did what was expected of them or
whether they were killed by Pāñcālas
10. 8. 4; when Aśvatthāman came out
of the camp, Kṛpa and Kṛtavarman told
him that they had killed Pāñcālas (when
they tried to escape) by thousands; Aśva-
tthāman told them that he had killed the
rest of the Pāñcālas in the camp 10. 8. 141,
150; after killing all Pāñcālas, the three
of them went to Duryodhana; they told
him that all Pāñcālas were killed by them
10. 9. 1, 9, 49; the killing of Pāñcālas
referred to earlier by Dhṛtarāṣṭra as a
disgusting and disgraceful act of Aśva-
tthāman and others 1. 1. 153; 1. 2. 181;
Kṛṣṇa consoled Yudhiṣṭhira by telling
him that Pāñcālas and their companions
({%pāñcālāś ca sahānugāḥ%}) were killed by
Mahādeva (and not by Aśvatthāman) 10.
18. 26; when Dhṛtarāṣṭra was on his way
to the battlefield, Aśvatthāman and others
told him and Gāndhārī that they had
killed Pāñcālas and others 11. 10. 12; (64)
When Yudhiṣṭhira started to meet Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra, Pāñcāla women present there,
followed him ({%saha pāñcālayoṣidbhir yās%}
{%tatrāsan samāgatāḥ%}) 11. 11. 4; (65)
When Pāñcāla and Kuru women saw their
husbands and relatives lying dead on the
battlefield they fell down from their
chariots; tired and helpless they were
almost deprived of their consciousness
({%śrāntānāṃ cāpy anāthānāṃ nāsīt kācana%}
{%cetanā%}) 11. 16. 13-15; Gāndhārī told Kṛṣṇa
that looking at the destruction of Kurus
and Pāñcālas, she burnt with grief 11. 16.
25; she asked him how was young Abhi-
[Page781-b+ 40]
manyu killed by many in the presence of
Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas 11. 20. 18; (66)
Yudhiṣṭhira told Kuntī that he was much
more grieved to learn the truth about
Karṇa's birth than by the death of Pāñcālas
and others ({%tataḥ śataguṇaṃ duḥkham%})
11. 27. 18-19; (67) Yudhiṣṭhira, repent-
ing after the war, said that Pāñcālas and
Kurus were no doubt killed; but those
of them who were not killed would, after
death, go to the lowest regions on account
of their (i. e. of both Pāñcālas and
Kurus) acts 12. 7. 20; Yudhiṣṭhira while
taking leave of Kuntī said that Pāñcālas
(i. e. their males) were very much depleted,
only their daughters remained ({%pañcālāḥ%}
{%subhṛśaṃ kṣīṇāḥ kanyāmātrāvaśeṣitāḥ%}); he
did not know who would establish their
