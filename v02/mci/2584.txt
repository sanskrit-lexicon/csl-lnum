the army ({%bhīṣmo 'grataḥ sarvasainyasya%}

that day the Kaurava army which included
Sindhu warriors and Sauvīras ran helter-
skelter since they were being killed by the
arrows of Bhīma and Karṇa fighting each
other ({%tato vyudastaṃ tat sainyaṃ sindhu-%}
{%sauvīrakauravam%}); they ran away from
them in all directions; the earth was covered
with their bodies along with their armours,
arrows and banners; when Karṇa saw the
destruction of the Kurus Sauvīras and Sain-
dhavas he was ablaze with anger ({%dṛṣṭvā%}

7. 113. 11-14; 7. 114. 17-18; (10) During
the night war (fourteenth-fifteenth day) all
Saindhavas and others, afraid, (simply)
watched Karṇa who alone could withstand
the shower of weapons released at him
by Ghaṭotkaca; they respected his compo-
sure in battle ({%asaṃmohaṃ pūjayanto'sya%}
{%saṃkhye%}) 7. 154. 45; (11) After the war,
the women of Sindhu, Sauvīra and other
countries kept a watch on the dead body
of Jayadratha ({%sindhusauvī ragāndhāra-%}

When Arjuna reached the Sindhu country
along with Aśvamedha horse, the warriors
and their kings fought a fierce battle with
him; they encircled Arjuna so that he look-
ed like a bird moving in a cage ({%koṣṭhakī-%}

14. 76. 10, 13; Arjuna swooned for a
while due to the shower of the arrows of
Sindhu fighters ({%saindhavāḥ%}) 14. 76. 21-23;
when he recovered, he started showering
arrows so that the Saindhava warriors and
their kings could not be seen; the Sain-
dhavas were afraid due to the sound (of
the bow); they ran, wept due to sorrow
[Page908-b+ 40]
and lay down on the ground; the army (of
Saindhavas) was thus torn by Arjuna

76. 28-29, 32; the Saindhava warriors were
once again ready to fight with Arjuna and
they showered arrows at him; Arjuna told
them that he would not kill them if they
surrendered; but Saindhava warriors conti-
nued to shoot arrows; the kings of the
Sindhu country remembering the death of
Jayadratha threw {%prāsas%} and {%śaktis%} on
Arjuna; he cut off their missiles before
they reached him; the warriors, desirous
of victory, continued their attack ({%āpata-%}
{%tāṃ teṣāṃ yodhānāṃ jayagṛddhinām%})
14. 77. 18; Arjuna cut off their heads; they
ran away but returned and although they
were being killed they fought with Arjuna
according to their vigour and energy
({%yathāprāṇaṃ yathotsāhaṃ yodhayām āsur%}
{%arjunam%}) most of them, whose horses
were tired, swooned ({%kṛtā visaṃjñā bhū-%}
{%yiṣṭhāḥ klāntavāhanasainikāḥ%}); knowing
their plight, Duḥśalā, daughter of Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra, took her grandson with her and
approached Arjuna wishing peace for the
surviving warriors ({%śāntyarthaṃ sarva-%}
{%yodhānām; śamārthaṃ sarvayodhānām%}); she
requested him to cease fighting with Sain-
dhavas ({%śamaṃ gaccha dhanaṃjaya%}); thus
Arjuna defeated Saindhava warriors 14. 77.
