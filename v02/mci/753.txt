18. 5. 31-32) composed it having seen it with

5. 33; Vyāsa had assured Dhṛtarāṣṭra that
he would proclaim the fame of the Kurus
and the Pāṇḍavas 6. 2. 13; the sage is also
credited to have made the Parvasaṃgraha
listing a hundred sub-{%parvans%} of the Bhārata

1. 56. 31. {@E.@} Extent: One hundred

[Page195-b+ 40]

abridgements are referred to in 1. 1. 25
({%vistaraiś ca samāsaiś ca dhāryate yad%}
{%dvijātibhiḥ%}); the sage himself is credited
with an abridgement of the store of know-
ledge after he had first expounded it in full;
learned men desire to preserve it in full as
well as in abridgement ({%vistīryaitan mahaj%}
{%jñānam ṛṣiḥ saṃkṣepam abravīt / iṣtaṃ hi%}
{%vidusāṃ loke samāsavyāsadhāranam%}) 1. 1.
49; the sage Dvaipāyana abridged (the full
extent of one hundred thousand {%ślokas%} into
24000 {%ślokas%} by omitting the {%upākhyānas-%}
this is known as Bhārata ({%caturviṃśatisā-%}
{%hasrīṃ cakre bhāratasaṃhitām / upākhyā-%}
{%nair vinā tāvad bhārataṃ procyate budhaiḥ%})
1. 1. 61; it was further abridged into 150
{%ślokas%} in the form of a table of contents of all
the incidents of the sub-{%parvans%} (this could
refer to 1. 2. 71-233) ({%tato 'dhyardhaśataṃ%}

sub-{%parvans%} of the Bhārata (1. 2. 34-1. 2.
70) is included in its abridgement ({%samāso%}
{%bhāratasyāyaṃ tatroktaḥ parvasaṃgrahaḥ%})
1. 2. 71; before narrating in all details, the
Mahābhārata was first summarized by
Vaiśampāyana for Janamejaya ({%kathitaṃ%}
{%vai samāsena tvayā sarvaṃ dvijottama /%}
{%mahābhārataṃ ākhyānam%}) 1. 56. 1;
this summary began with the return of
the Pāṇḍavas to Hāstinapura after the
death of Pāṇḍu and it ended with the death
of Duryodhana and the Pāṇḍavas obtaining
the kingdom 1. 55. 6-42; a sort of a sum-
mary which began with Pāṇḍu's conquering
many countries and then retiring to the forest
[Page196-a+ 40]
and ended with the great destruction after the
war leaving only ten heroes alive is made by
Sūta Ugraśravas for the sages assembled in
the Naimiṣa forest 1. 1. 67-158. {@G.@} Three
beginnings: According to Sūta Ugraśravas
there were three different views regarding the
beginning of the Bhārata: (1) according
to one view it began with Manu Vaivasvata
({%manvādi bhārataṃ kecit%}) 1. 1. 50 (i. e.
with {%prajāpates tu dakṣasya manor vaivas-%}
{%vatasya ca / … anvaye // yādavānām imaṃ%}
{%vaṃśaṃ pauravāṇāṃ ca sarvaśaḥ / tathaiva%}
{%bhāratānāṃ ca%} (?) 1. 70. 1-2); Devabodha
on 1. 1. 50 explains {%manuḥ%} as {%ādirājaḥ;%}
according to Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 1. 52, in
the opinion of the easterners, {%manu%} means
{%mantra%} and hence {%manvādi%} refers to the
{%maṅgala%} stanza {%nārāyaṇaṃ namaskṛtya%} etc.
or {%om namo bhagavate%} etc. found at the
beginning of the epic in some manuscripts;
in his own opinion, however, {%manu%} refers to
Manu Vaivasvata, the son of the heaven, cf.
{%manur mantraḥ nārāyaṇaṃ namaskṛtyeti /%}
{%om namo bhagavate vāsudevāyeti vā tadādi%}
{%iti prañcaḥ / divaḥ putro vaivasvatamahya-%}
{%saṃjño manus tadādīti tattvam /%}); (2)
according to another view the Bhārata
begins with {%āstīka (āstīkādi tathāpare)%}
1. 1. 50 (i. e. with the {%adhyāya%} 1. 13
beginning of the Āstīkaparvan); (3) accor-
ding to a third view it begins with {%uparicara%}
{%(tathoparicarād anye)%} 1. 1. 50 (i. e. with
{%rājoparicaro nāma%} 1. 57. 1). {@H.@} Its
first teaching and subsequent narrations:
(1) Teaching: Dvaipāyana (Vyāsa) first
taught it to his son Śuka and then handed
it over to his other deserving pupils 1. 1. 63;
he taught it to Śuka together with the four
{%ślokas%} (18. 5. 47-50) known as the Bhārata-
sāvitrī 18. 5. 51; Vyāsa taught the Mahabhā-
[Page196-b+ 40]
rata to his pupils Sumantu, Jaimini, Paila,
Vaiśaṃpāyana and to his son Śuka 1. 57.
74-75; Vyāsa taught it to them on the mount
Meru 12. 327. 16-18; on the slope of the
Himavant mountain ({%himavatpāde%}) 12. 337.
9, 12, 14-15 ({%vedārthān bhāratārthāṃś ca%}
{% … vyāhartum upacakrame%}); (2) Narra-
tions: (i) Nārada recited it for the gods,
Asita Devala for the manes ({%pitṛn%}), and
Śuka for the Gandharvas, the Yaksas and the
demons 1. 1. 64; 18. 5. 42; (ii) The pupils
of Vyāsa made separate public recitations of
the Bhārata saṃhitā received by them from
him ({%saṃhitās taiḥ pṛthaktvena bhāratasya%}
{%prakāśitāḥ%}) 1. 57. 75; (iii) one such reci-
tation by his pupil Vaiśaṃpāyana is recorded
in the epic: When Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana arrived
at the snake-sacrifice of Janamejaya he was
requested by the king to narrate to him the
life-story of the Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas
(1. 54. 18 ff.); Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana then
asked his pupil Vaiśaṃpāyana to narrate it
as the latter had heard it from him; Vaiśaṃ-
pāyana then narrated the whole {%purātana%}
{%itihāsa%} to the king, and to those who had
assembled in the {%sadas,%} and to all other
Kṣatriyas ({%tasmai rājñe sadasyebhyaḥ%}
{%kṣatriyebhyaś ca sarvaśaḥ%}) 1. 54. 21-24;
1. 1. 8-10; 1. 1. 18; 1. 1. 57-58; 1. 55. 2-3;
1. 55. 4-43 (summary); 18. 5. 26, 30, 42;
18. 1. 2; (iv) but in one place the {%ākhyāna%}
is said to have been narrated by Vyāsa
himself to Janamejaya continuously ({%vyāsas%}
{%tv akathayan nityam ākhyānaṃ bhārataṃ%}
{%mahat%}) 1. 53 31; he narrated it in intervals
({%mahābhāratam ākhyānaṃ … janamejayena%}

{%vayām āsa vidhivat tadā karmāntareṣu%}
{%saḥ /%}) 1. 53. 32-33; (v) it was further
narrated by Sūta Ugraśravas, son of Loma-
[Page197-a+ 40]
harṣaṇa, to Śaunaka and the other sages
assembled in the Naimiṣa forest for the
twelve-yearly sacrificial session of Śaunaka
as the Sūta had heard the composition of
Vyāsa being told by Vaiśaṃpāyana to Jana-
mejaya in the latter's snake sacrifice 1. 1.
8-10, 23; 1. 4. 1; 1. 2. 74; 1. 1. 67-158

the Parvasaṃgraha (1. 2. 34-69) made by
Vyāsa as also the eighteen major {%parvans%}

in each {%parvan%} 1. 2. 72-234; 1. 53. 27-
36; 18. 5. 30. {@I.@} Purpose: To spread
