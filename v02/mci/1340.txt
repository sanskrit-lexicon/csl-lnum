forest is also described in 3. 25. 17-20
(having many kinds of trees and birds, which

the demon Kirmīra in the Kāmyaka forest,
the Pāṇḍavas proceeded towards the Dvaita-
vana 3. 12. 18; (2) The Pāṇḍavas wishing
[Page367-b+ 40]
to settle down for their forest life near the lake
Dvaitavana, entered the forest Dvaitavana
3. 25. 13, 16; (3) In the Dvaitavana (not
named) the Pāṇḍavas sported in the auspici-
ous woods of the Śāla trees along the river
Sarasvatī; there Yudhiṣṭhira satisfied the
twice-borns by offering them large-sized roots
and fruit; there Dhaumya officiated for their
religious rites to gods and manes; sage
Mārkaṇḍeya arrived there as a guest of the
Pāṇḍavas 3. 26. 1-4; (4) When the Pāṇḍa-
vas lived in the Dvaitavana, the forest
was full of Brāhmaṇas; the forest resounded
with the sound of Vedic recitations of the
Brāhmaṇas and the sound of the bow-strings
of the Pāṇḍavas; thus the Kṣatriya valour,
united with Brahmanic lustre, shone all the
more in the forest ({%saṃsṛṣṭaṃ brahmaṇā%}
{%kṣatraṃ bhūya eva vyarocata%}); Baka Dāl-
bhya pointed out to Yudhiṣṭhira Bhṛgus and
others who, when protected by Yudhiṣṭhira,
gave offerings in fire ({%caranti dharmaṃ%}
{%puṇye 'smiṃs tvayā guptā dhṛtavratāḥ%}) 3.
27. 1-8; (5) Vyāsa advised Yudhiṣṭhira to
leave the Dvaitavana since staying long at
one place was not desirable; hence he went
from the Dvaita to the Kāmyaka forest 3.
37. 31-32, 37; (6) Later when the
Pāṇḍavas returned to the Dvaitavana from
the Gandhamādana, the ascetics in the forest
returned to them 3. 174. 22; (7) Karṇa
suggested to Duryodhana to visit the lake
Dvaitavana to show the pomp of the Kauravas
to the Pāṇḍavas 3. 226. 12-13; Duryodhana
approved of this idea; his only purpose was
to oust the Pāṇḍavas from the forest ({%na%}
{%hi dvaitavane kiṃcid vidyate 'nyat prayo-%}
{%janam / utsādanam ṛte teṣām vanasthānāṃ%}
{%mama dviṣaḥ%}), and to show them, who
were in miserable condition, his pomp 3.
[Page368-a+ 40]
227. 5, 8-11; Karṇa suggested that their
pretext to visit the Dvaitavana should be to
meet the cowherds who awaited Duryodhana's
visit ({%ghoṣā dvaitavane sarve tvatpratīkṣā%}
{%narādhipa / ghoṣayātrāpadeśena gamiṣyāmo%}
{%na saṃśayaḥ%}) 3. 227. 19, 23; (8)
Yudhiṣṭhira reminded the Kauravas through
Saṃjaya of their defeat at the hands of the
Gandharvas in the Dvaitavana, where they
had arrived for the Ghoṣayātrā, and their
subsequent release from the captivity of
their adversaries by Bhīmasena and Arjuna
5. 23. 25; Śalya later alleged that in that
encounter with the Gandharvas Karṇa was
the first to run away from the battle
8. 28. 59; (9) After the Ghoṣayātrā
incident the Pāṇḍavas lived happily in the
Dvaitavana forest 3. 235. 25; (10)
Duḥśāsana sent a messenger to the Pāṇḍavas
and the Brāhmaṇas living in the Dvaitavana
to invite them to attend Duryodhana's
Vaiṣṇava Yajña 3. 242. 7; (11) Yudhi-
ṣṭhira, disturbed by Karṇa's vow to kill
Arjuna, thought of leaving the Dvaita-
vana 3. 243. 21; (12) While living in the
Dvaitavana, Yudhiṣṭhira once saw deer in a
dream who requested him to leave the forest
and go elsewhere as, on account of their pre-
sence, only a few deer were left in that forest
3. 244. 2, 5; (13) At the end of the
twelfth year of their forest life the Pāṇḍavas
went from the Kāmyaka to the Mārkaṇḍeyā-
śrama in the Dvaitavana 3. 294. 43; 3. 295.
3; (14) During their stay in the Dvaita-
vana the Pāṇḍavas, while once braving for the
sake of a Brāhmaṇa ({%brāhmaṇārthe parā-%}
{%krāntāḥ%}), met with great difficulty which,
however, ended happily 17. 3. 18-19; 18. 3.
31 (a reference to the Yakṣapraśṇa episode;
Yudhiṣṭhira was tested by Dharma in that
[Page368-b+ 40]
episode which took place in the Dvaitavana
3. 295. 7-3. 298. 25); (15) Yudhiṣṭhira,
at the end of the twelfth year, while dismiss-
ing those who stayed with him in the forest,
asked them to tell people that they did not
know where the Pāṇḍavas went after they
(the Pāṇḍavas) left them in the Dvaitavana
4. 4. 5; (16) In the Dvaitavana Arjuna
used to praise the heroic qualities of Sātyaki
for Yudhiṣṭhira 7. 85. 61; (17) Yudhiṣṭhira,
humiliated by Karṇa, blamed Arjuna for not
killing Karṇa and told Arjuna that he should
have admitted to the Pāṇḍavas in the
Dvaitavana itself that he would not be able
to stand up to Karṇa in the war 8. 48. 2;
(18) Yudhiṣṭhira was dejected at the thought
of the destruction in the war and was think-
ing of retiring to forest; Draupadī then
reminded him of his resolve to kill
Duryodhana and rule the earth which he had
announced to his brothers in the Dvaitavana
12. 14. 8; (19) In the Dvaitavana,
Balarāma met the sages, bathed in Dvaitavana
lake (not named) and then proceeded along
the southern bank of the Sarasvatī 9. 36.
26-28.
