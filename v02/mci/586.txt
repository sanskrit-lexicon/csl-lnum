{@Vyūha@}¦ m.: A particular way of arrang-
ing the army for war; most of the Vyūhas
used by the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas are
named (Ardhacandra, Krauñca, Garuḍa,
Cakra, Cakraśakaṭa, Candrārdha, Padma,
Parānīkabhid (?), Bārhaspatya, Makara,
Maṇḍala, Maṇḍalārdha, Mahāvyūha, Vajra,
Vyāla (?), Śakaṭa (= Cakraśakaṭa), Śṛṅgāṭaka,
Śyena, Sarvatobhadra and Sūcī).
<div n="P">Some of the Vyūhas used by the two
sides on certain days are neither described
in detail nor named; on the other hand,
details of those used by the two sides on the
tenth day of the war are available, but they
are not named. (1) The Vyūha used by
the Pāṇḍavas: Described as overpowering
all the foes ({%sarvaśatrunibarhaṇa%}) 6. 104.
4; Śikhaṇḍin was in the front of the entire
army ({%sarvasainyānām agra āsīt%}); Bhīma-
sena and Dhanaṃjaya acted as the protectors
of his wheel ({%cakrarakṣau%}); behind them
marched the sons of Draupadī and Abhi-
manyu, Sātyaki and Cekitāna; Dhṛṣṭadyumna,
guarded all around by the Pāñcāla army,
acted as their protector; behind them was
Yudhiṣṭhira with Nakula and Sahadeva;
behind them moved Virāṭa surrounded by
his own army, and he was followed by
Drupada; the five Kekaya brothers and
Dhṛṣṭaketu guarded the rear ({%jaghanaṃ%}
[Page144-a+ 40]
{%pālayām āsa%}) 6. 104. 3-10; this Vyūha
could be one of the Mānuṣa, Daiva,
Gāndharva or Āsura Vyūhas known to
Dhṛṣṭadyumna 5. 56. 11; (2) The counter-
Vyūha of the Kauravas used on that day:
the entire Kaurava army was led by Bhīṣma
({%agraṭaḥ sarvasainyānām%}); he was guarded
by the sons of Dhṛṭarāṣṭra; they were
followed by Droṇa and his son Aśvatthāman;
Bhagadatta, with his army of elephants,
followed them; Kṛpa and Kṛtavarman followed
Bhagadatta; next came Sudakṣiṇa, the king
of the Kāmbojas, Jayatsena, the king of the
Magadhas, and Bṛhadbala, the son of Subala;
other kings headed by Suśarman guarded
the rear ({%jaghanaṃ pālayām āsuḥ%})
6. 104. 15; similarly, during the war
at night (between the fourteenth and
the fifteenth day), the Kaurava army
was rearranged ({%punar vyūham akal-%}
{%payat%} 7. 138. 10) by Duryodhana (?, by
Droṇa ?); this Vyūha is also not named;
Droṇa was in the front, Aśvatthāman and
Śakuni on either side, and Śalya in the rear;
Duryodhana himself protected all the wings
of the army 7. 138. 11; this Vyūha in which
the chariots, horses, and elephants took up
their positions looked like (the armies in)
the Vyūha of the gods and the demons
7. 138. 32.
