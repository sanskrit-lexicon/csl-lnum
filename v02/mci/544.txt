<div n="P">Arjuna, who knew the {%mantras%} of this
missile, charged his arrow with the Mahāstra
when he shot it at Karṇa to kill him ({%yuktvā%}
{%mahāstreṇa pareṇa mantravit%}); he then
described his arrow as Mahāstra ({%ayam%}
{%mahāstro 'pratimo dhṛtaḥ śaraḥ%}) 8. 67. 19;
he also strengthened it with the power of
truth by making a {%satyakriyā (tapo 'sti%}

{%suhṛdāṃ tathā śrutam / anena satyena ni-%}

to work like a fierce {%atharvāṅgirasī%} magic
and bring victory to Arjuna ({%kṛtyām athar-%}
{%vāṅgirasīm ivogrāṃ … ayaṃ śaro me vija-%}
{%yāvaho 'stu%}) 8. 67. 21-22.
