{@Vāyavyāstra, (Vāyavya)@}¦ nt. (rarely pl.
1. 225. 12): Name of a missile related to
god Vāyu 3. 164. 29; to Vāta 3. 161. 28;
to Mātariśvan 4. 56. 14.
{@A.@} Description: heavenly ({%divya%})
5. 181. 13; 7. 132. 28; best ({%uttama%}) 1. 218.
15; very fierce ({%sudāruṇa%}) 6. 98. 20. {@B.@} Its
knowledge: Arjuna learnt it from god Vāyu
when he, after satisfying Mahādeva (Śiva),
received it in the heaven along with many
other heavenly weapons 1. 225. 12 (pl.
{%vāyavyāni%}); 3. 164. 29; 3. 161. 28 (Vāta);
4. 56. 14 (Mātariśvan); 6. 116. 38; but
apparently he had also learnt it earlier
from Droṇa since he used it while displaying
his skill in archery (1. 125. 19), and at
the time of burning the Khāṇḍava forest
(1. 218. 15); Droṇa, of course, knew it,
and it was known to many other epic heroes,
viz. Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Karṇa, Aśvatthāman,
Yudhiṣṭhira, and the Pāṇḍya king (see the
next section); it was known also, perhaps, to
Kṛṣṇa 6. 116. 39. {@C.@} Use: (1) In the epic
war: (i) by Arjuna, agaisnt the Trigartas;
noticing its employment, Droṇa repelled it
with the Śaila astra 6. 98. 18-20; against
the Saṃśaptakas, to scatter their shower of
arrows, when they covered Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna
with their arrows; the two, therefore, could
[Page138-b+ 40]
not be seen and were mistaken to be dead
7. 18. 17-22; god Vāyu carried away
the Saṃśaptakas together with their horses,
elephants, chariots and weapons like dried
leaves; they looked like birds flying from
trees 7. 18. 17-23; agaisnt Droṇa to repel
the Vāyavyāstra released by him 7. 163. 28
(here not specifically named: {%astṛāṇy astrair%}
{%yadā tasya vidhivad dhanti pāṇḍavaḥ%});
against Karṇa, to scatter the clouds created
by his Vāruṇāstra 8. 67. 11; (ii) by
Droṇa, against Yudhiṣṭhira 7. 132. 28; again
against Yudhiṣṭhira, when Droṇa was for
a moment distressed by Yudhiṣṭhira's arrow
and had to sit down in the chariot 7. 137.
40-42; against the army of king Drupada
to blow it away, as wind blows away the
clouds 7. 136. 10; 7. 132. 37; against Arjuna
7. 163. 28; (iii) by Yudhiṣṭhira, to combat
successfully the same Astra used against him
by Droṇa ({%astram astreṇa jaghnivān%})
7. 132. 28; again to halt the same Astra used
against him by Droṇa ({%tad astram astreṇa%}
{%raṇe stambhayām āsa%}) 7. 137. 42; (iv) by
Aśvatthāman, against Ghaṭotkaca to blow him
away ({%vyadhamat%}) when Ghaṭotkaca em-
ployed his {%māyā%} to become a dark cloud to
attack Aśvatthāman 7. 131. 71-72; (v) by
Karṇa, against Ghaṭotkaca under similar
conditions 7. 150. 70-71; (vi) by the
Pāṇḍya king, to obstruct ({%rudh-%}) the shower
of arrows released by Aśvatthāman
on his army 8. 15. 30-31; (2) Outside the
epic war—(i) Arjuna used it by reciting
{%mantras (abhimantrya)%} to dispel the clouds
and the lightning created by Vāyu and Indra
at the time of burning the Khāṇḍava forest
1. 218. 15; Arjuna used it against Kirāta
(Śiva), but the missile had no effect on
him 3. 163. 29-30; against Droṇa at the
[Page139-a+ 40]
time of the cattle-raid to swallow the Vāya-
vyāstra used by Droṇa ({%vāyavyaṃ … %}
{%astram astreṇa pāṇḍavaḥ / … grasate%}
{%sma … %}) 4. 53. 48; against Bhīṣma at the
time of the cattle raid 4. 59. 21; at the
time of displaying his skill in the use of
missiles 1. 125. 19; (ii) by Bhīṣma, against
Arjuna at the time of the cattle-raid 4. 59.
21; against Rāma Jāmadagnya who combated
it with the use of the Guhyakāstra 5. 181.
11; (iii) by Droṇa, against Arjuna at the
time of the cattle-raid 4. 53. 48; (iv) the
effect of the Vāyavyāstra was produced by
the Nivātakavaca demons by employing
their {%māyā%} while fighting with Arjuna; it
produced wind, the velocity of which was
obstructed by Arjuna by the use of the Śaila
astra ({%śailena ca mahāstreṇa vāyor vegam%}
{%adhārayam%}) 3. 168. 9-10; the demons again
practised their different {%māyās%} simultaneously
({%prākurvan vividhā māyā yaugapadyena%})
and produced the Astra of Vāyu (along
with that of Agni and the Aśmavarṣa); it
oppressed Arjuna and produced darkness all
around, which was dispelled by Arjuna
by employing his Astramāyā 3. 168.
11-13, 25-26. {@D.@} Effects: Arjuna
created wind by the use of the Vāyavya astra
({%vāyavyenāsṛjad vāyum%}) 1. 125. 19; the
wind that was released by the use of the
missile agitated the sky, felled the trees, and
killed soldiers 6. 98. 18-20; when used against
the Saṃśaptakas, god Vāyu ({%bhagavān%}
{%vāyuḥ%}) swept them away together with their
horses, elephants, chariots and weapons, like
dried leaves; they appeared like birds flying
away from trees 7. 18. 22-23. [See
{@Vāyuvarṣa@}]
