left side (while Sainya carried it on the right)
10. 13. 2; (however Uttara compared the
horse yoked on the right side of his chariot
with Sugrīva 4. 40. 18); often only the two
(Sainya and Sugrīva), and not all the four
horses, mentioned as yoked to Kṛṣṇa's chariot,
especially when the chariot did not figure
in the war-context; hence Kṛṣṇa's epithet
{%sainya-sugrīvavāhanaḥ%} 2. 2. 13; 5. 81. 58;
9. 61. 39. {@C.@} Mention on various occa-
sions: {@1.@} Only the two yoked to the
chariot: (1) When the chariot was used by
Arjuna (for abducting Subhadrā) to go out
for hunting 1. 212. 3; (2) When Kṛṣṇa's
chariot was made ready for his departure
to Dvārakā from Khāṇḍavaprastha 2. 2. 13;

after meeting the Pāṇḍavas in the forest
3. 23. 45; (4) When Kṛṣṇa came again

[Page067-b+ 40]

war 12. 38. 39; (8) When Kṛṣṇa marched
out of Dvārakā to attack Śālva in his town
Saubha 3. 21. 12; {@2.@} All the four, i. e.
Sainya, Sugrīva, Meghapuṣpa and Balāhaka,
yoked to the chariot, mostly when the chariot
figured in the war-context: (1) When
the chariot was to be kept ready for Kṛṣṇa's
likely intervention in the war to kill the
Kaurava heroes in order to enable Arjuna to
fulfil his vow to kill Jayadratha before
sunset 7. 56. 35; (2) When the chariot
was brought to Sātyaki when he lost his

Bhīṣma lying on his bed of arrows 12. 53. 21;
12. 46. 35 (here although only Sainya and
Sugrīva are named, all the four are
intended); {@3.@} Only Sugrīva, without
Sainya, named as yoked to the chariot
5. 22. 27; 5. 47. 62. [In 12. 102. 17
warriors are described as {%udvṛttāś caiva%}
{%sugrīvāḥ%} where {%sugrīvāḥ%} apparently means
‘those having good necks’. But Nī. who
reads {%uddhatā īva sugrīvāḥ%} takes {%sugrīvāḥ%}
to stand for all the horses of Kṛṣṇa,
Sugrīva and the others ({%vāsudevāśvā iva%}
{%uddhatāḥ,%} on Bom. Edn. 12. 101. 17]
