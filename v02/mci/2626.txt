{@Kuṇḍadhāra@}¦ m.: Name of a cloud.
{@A.@} Description: An attendant of gods
({%devānucara%}) 12. 263. 6; lustrous ({%kuṇḍa-%}
{%dhārasya tejasā%}) 12. 263. 13; of great
lustre ({%mahādyuti%}) 12. 263. 17, 20; of great
fame ({%mahāyaśas%}) 12. 263. 27; magnanim-
ous ({%mahātman%}) 12. 263. 7. {@B.@} Kuṇḍa-
dhāra figures in an ancient narrative
({%itihāsaṃ purātanam%}) told by Bhīṣma to
Yudhiṣṭhira in reply to his question:
What is most profitable among the three
Puruṣārthas viz. {%dharma, artha%} and {%kāma%}
(2. 263. 1-2); in the narrative, Kuṇḍadhāra
obliges a Brāhmaṇa due to affection for
his devotee ({%kuṇḍadhāreṇa yat prītyā%}
{%bhaktāyopakṛtaṃ purā%}) 12. 263. 2-55;
the narrative runs as follows: A certain
poor Brāhmaṇa desired to obtain wealth
in order to perform a sacrifice; he therefore
worshipped many deities but did not get
wealth; he then wondered which could be
that one deity which would show him favour
[Page936-a+ 40]
quickly; he then saw standing near him
the cloud Kuṇḍadhāra ({%jaladharaṃ kuṇḍa-%}
{%dhāraṃ%} st. 6) who appeared before him
assuming an agreeable form ({%saumyena%}
{%vapuṣā%} st. 6); the Brāhmaṇa felt assured
by Kuṇḍadhāra's form and felt that he
would definitely give him ample wealth;
the Brāhmaṇa became his devotee and
worshipped Kuṇḍadhāra with incenses,
perfumes, garlands and oblations ({%tato%}
{%dhūpaiś ca gandhaiś ca mālyair uccāvacair%}
{%api /balibhiś cāpi … ,%} st. 9); the cloud,
satisfied, told the Brāhmaṇa that there were
expiations for the sins committed due to
killing a Brāhmaṇa, drinking wine, theft,
breaking a vow, but there was no expiation
for the sin of ungratefulness ({%kṛtaghne%}
{%nāsti niṣkṛtiḥ%} st. 11); {%adharma%} was the
child of craving, anger of envy, greed of
insult ({%nikṛtyāḥ%}), and that an ungrateful
person did not deserve progeny ({%kṛtaghno%}
{%nārhati prajām%} st. 12); then the Brāhmaṇa,
lying on the {%kuśa%} grass, due to the lustre
({%tejas%}) of Kuṇḍadhāra, saw in a dream
({%nidarśanam apaśyata%} st. 14), Maṇibhadra
distributing kingdoms and wealth as desir-
ed by gods ({%maṇibhadraṃ vyādiśantam … /%}
{%tatra devāḥ prayacchanti rājyāni ca%}
{%dhanāni ca%} st. 15-16); Kuṇḍadhāra fell
at the feet of Maṇibhadra; Maṇibhadra, at
the instance of gods, asked Kuṇḍadhāra
what he desired; Kuṇḍadhāra replied that if
the gods were satisfied with him they should
show that kind of favour to the Brāhmaṇa
which would lead him to happiness ({%asyā-%}
{%nugraham icchāmi kṛtaṃ kiṃcit sukho-%}
{%dayam%} st. 19); again, at the instance of
the gods, Maṇibhadra told Kuṇḍadhāra
that he was willing to give the Brāhmaṇa
as much wealth as desired by him; Kuṇḍa-
[Page936-b+ 40]
dhāra then, reflecting that a man's (wealth)
was fickle, decided to fix the Brāhmaṇa's
mind on practising austerities ({%vicārya%}
{%kuṇḍadhāras tu mānuṣaṃ calam adhruvam /%}
{%tapase matim ādhatta brāhmaṇasya yaśas-%}
{%vinaḥ%}) 12. 263. 22; Kuṇḍadhāra therefore
told Maṇibhadra that he would not seek
wealth for the Brāhmaṇa, but that the
Brāhmaṇa be devoted to {%dharma;%} he desir-
ed that the Brāhmaṇa should take delight
in {%dharma%} and should live following the
{%dharma (bhaved eṣa tu dhārmikaḥ / dharme%}
{%'sya ramatāṃ buddhir dharmaṃ caivopa-%}
{%jīvatu / )%} 12. 263. 25; when Maṇibhadra
persisted on giving the Brāhmaṇa kingdom
and various kinds of happiness since that
was what one aspired to get by follow-
ing {%dharma,%} Kuṇḍadhāra did not change
his mind and wanted his Brāhmaṇa devotee
to live following the {%dharma;%} the gods
were pleased with him; Maṇibhadra told
Kuṇḍadhāra that the gods were satisfied
with him and that the Brāhmaṇa's mind
would be fixed on {%dharma%} and that he would
be a {%dharmātmā;%} Kuṇḍadhāra was delight-
ed for having obtained what was desired in
the form of a boon not easily obtained by
others; the Brāhmaṇa saw thin garments
around him but his mind was not deluded;
abandoning them, he went to the forest
and practised severe austerities; he felt that
if he so desired he could certainly give
some one even kingdom (12. 263. 30-39);
at that juncture Kuṇḍadhāra again appeared
before the Brāhmaṇa due to his friendship
with him and the severe austerities per-
formed by him; the Brāhmaṇa, surprised,
received him according to the rites; Kuṇḍa-
dhāra told the Brāhmaṇa that he had now
obtained the highest divine insight ({%divyaṃ%}
[Page937-a+ 40]
{%te cakṣur uttamam%} 12. 263. 42) and by
using it the Brāhmaṇa should see the ulti-
mate fate of the kings and the worlds
they would get; then the Brāhmaṇa by his
divine eye saw thousands of kings sunk in
the hell; Kuṇḍadhāra wondered that if the
Brāhmaṇa, after worshipping him was to
get unhappiness, what kind of favour had
he done to him ? He therefore asked the
Brāhmaṇa (to use his divine eye and) to
realize that it was futile to run after various
longings because the door to heaven was
closed for such men ({%kāmān icched kathaṃ%}
{%naraḥ / svargadvāraṃ hi saṃruddhaṃ mānu-%}
{%ṣeṣu viśeṣataḥ //%} 12. 263. 45); the Brāhmaṇa
then saw that lust, anger, greed, fear,
arrogance, sleep, drowsiness, laziness hinder
men from going to heaven ({%tato 'paśyat sa%}
{%kāmaṃ ca krodhaṃ lobhaṃ bhayaṃ madam /%}
{%nidrāṃ tandrīṃ tathālasyam āvṛtya puruṣān%}
{%sthitān // %} 12. 263. 46); Kuṇḍadhāra again
told the Brāhmaṇa that the vices, mentioned
before, stopped men from going to heaven;
gods were afraid of such men; (these vices),
as ordained by the gods, create obstacles
all around ({%tathaiva devavacanād vighnaṃ%}
{%kurvanti sarvaśaḥ //%} 12. 263. 47); no one
who was not permitted by gods could be
virtuous; the Brāhmaṇa, due to his auste-
rities, could confer kingdoms and wealth
on others; the Brāhmaṇa fell at the feet
of the cloud ({%toyadhāriṇe%} i. e. Kuṇḍa-
dhāra) and told him that he had done a
great favour to him; he requested Kuṇḍa-
dhāra to forgive him for having formerly
envied him ({%purā te yad asūyitam%}) due
to his hankerings and greed; Kuṇḍadhāra
embraced the Brāhmaṇa and told him that
he had forgiven him and then disappeared;
the Brāhmaṇa then roamed through the
[Page937-b+ 40]
skies due to his austerities to which he was
led by Kuṇḍadhāra; due to his virtuousness
he also gained what he wanted and the
highest bliss ({%vihāyasā ca gamanaṃ tathā%}
{%saṃkalpitārthatā / dharmāc chaktyā tathā%}
{%yogād yā caiva paramā gatiḥ //%}) 12. 263.
