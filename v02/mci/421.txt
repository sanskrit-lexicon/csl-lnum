{@Stambamitra@}¦ m.: Name of one of the
four Śārṅgaka birds who survived the Khāṇ-
ḍava fire 1. 219. 40; 1. 220. 1-4.
<div n="P">The ascetic Mandapāla turned into a
Śārṅgaka bird had four sons from the Śārṅ-
gikā Jaritā; Mandapāla left them when they
were still in the eggs, but their mother did
not desert them; she reared them as birds
({%svavṛtyā%} 1. 220. 19) after they were born;
they all were seers ({%ṛṣi%}), knowers of Brah-
man, full of lustre and strong; they were able
speakers 1. 220. 17; 1. 224. 8, 10; 1. 225. 3;
when the fire began to burn the Khāṇḍava
forest Mandapāla praised Agni and secured
[Page079-b+ 40]
a promise from him not to burn his young ones
1. 220. 5, 16-32; 1. 223. 22-23; 1. 224. 9;
1. 225. 1; Stambamitra's father expected him
to practise austerities when he grew up 1. 221.
9; when the forest fire broke out the Śārṅgaka
young ones had not developed wings and feet
({%abarhāś caraṇair hīnāḥ%} 1. 221. 4, 18); as
the fire drew near they advised their mother
to abandon them and fly to a safe place;
she, on her part, advised them to creep into
the hole of a mouse to save themselves from
fire; they did not agree since they were
afraid of the mouse; when the young ones
were not prepared to enter the hole even
when assured by their mother that the mouse
was taken away by a falcon, she left them to
their fate 1. 221. 1-21; 1. 222. 1-16; as the
fire drew close the three younger Śārṅgaka
birds entreated the eldest one, Jarṅāri, to do
something to rescue them; on that occasion
Stambamitra said to his brother: “The eldest
is the protection, the eldest releases from
difficulty; if the eldest does not know (what
to do), what shall the younger one do ?”
(1. 223. 4); when the young Śārṅgaka birds
began to praise god fire in turns, Stamba-
mitra, when his turn arrived, said: “Oh
Agni, you are the only one, and this whole
world stands in you; you hold the beings
and you bear the world; you carry the ob-
lation, and wise men worship you as one and
as manifold; after creating these worlds,
you digest them when time arrives; you are
the source of this world and its mainstay;
oh lord of the world, you digest the food
eaten by the living beings” (1. 223. 12-15);
when the fire subsided the mother of the
Śarṅgaka birds returned to them 1. 224. 17;
sage Mandapāla also was anxious about the
safety of Stambamitra and the rest and he
[Page080-a+ 38]
returned to them; he was not greeted by the
children and they did not speak to him; he
enquired who was the eldest, who the next,
who the middle one and who the youngest;
when be assured them that he had already
secured their safety from god Fire they were
reconciled to him; Mandapāla left the region
of the Khāṇḍava forest and went elsewhere
with his wife and children 1. 224. 6, 20-22;
1. 225. 1-4.
