As told by Mātali to Arjuna: The city
once belonged to the king of gods (Indra);
the Nivātakavaca demons practised severe
austerities, satisfied Pitāmaha (Brahma-
deva) and obtained as a boon this city for
their residence and for freedom from fear
of gods in battles ({%idaṃ vṛtaṃ nivāsāya%}
{%devebhyaś cābhayaṃ yudhi //%}); Indra, out
of self-interest, agreed to what the demons
had asked for ({%vidhattāṃ bhagavān atrety%}
[Page595-b+ 40]
{%ātmano hitakāmyayā%}); the Nivātakavacas
then drove out gods from this place and
made the city their residence ({%tato nivāta-%}

{%śan nagare tasmin%}) 3. 168. 21; Arjuna
entered the town along with Mātali frighten-
ing the women by the loud sound of the
