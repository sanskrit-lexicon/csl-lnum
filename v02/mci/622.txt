{@Sūcī (Sūcī̆°)@}¦ f.: Name of a particular
arrangement of the army ({%vyūha%}).
{@A.@} When to be used: According to
the great sage Bṛhaspati if the number
of warriors in one's army was small it
should be gathered together, but if it was
large it might be spread out as much as
desired; in the former case the contingent in
the front should be arranged according to the
Sūcī vyūha ({%maharṣer vacanāt tāta veda-%}
{%yanti bṛhaspateḥ / saṃhatān yodhayed alpān%}
{%kāmaṃ vistārayed bahūn // sūcīmukham%}
{%anīkaṃ syād alpānāṃ bahubhiḥ saha /%}) 6.
19. 4-5; 12. 101. 44. {@B.@} Its use in the
[Page157-a+ 40]
epic war: (1) In the opinion of Yudhiṣṭhira,
since the Pāṇḍava army was smaller in
number than that of their opponent, it was to
be arranged as directed by the great sage
(Bṛhaspati); this was his suggestion to
Arjuna at the beginning of the war
on the first day ({%asmākaṃ ca tathā sainyam%}

5-6; (Arjuna, however, chose to arrange the
Pāṇḍava army according to the Vajravyūha 6.
19. 7); (2) When the contingent compris-
ing the Kekaya princess the sons of Draupadī,
and Dhṛṣṭaketu and which was led by Abhi-
manyu with a large force was asked by
Yudhiṣṭhira to rush to the aid of Bhīmasena
and Dhṛṣṭadyumna, they arranged themselves
in such a way that its front formed the
Sūcī 6. 73. 51, 54-55; (3) In order to
protect Jayadratha a small contingent was
arranged in the form of Sūcī which was
concealed in the middle of the Padma vyūha,
which itself formed the rear half of the main
Śakaṭa (7. 53. 27) or the Cakraśakaṭa vyūha
7. 63. 21; 7. 63. 23; the front of the Sūcī
({%sūcīmukha%}) was formed by Kṛtavarman,
followed by Jalasandha, the Kāmboja;
Duryodhana with his Amātyas stood behind
them; behind them, at the position of the
‘eye’ of the Sūci ({%? sūcipāśa%} 7. 63. 27),
stood Jayadratha surrounded by a large force
7. 63. 24-27; 7. 53. 27; a hundred thousand
warriors who would not turn away from the
battle-field were distributed in the Śakaṭa
vyūha to guard the Sūci vyūha ({%yodhānām%}
