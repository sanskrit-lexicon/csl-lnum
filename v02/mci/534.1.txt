{@Brahmāstra@}¦, {@Brāhma astra@}, ({@Paitā-@}
 {@maha@}) nt. (rarely pl. 7. 165. 22; 8. 29. 26):
Name of a missile.
{@A.@} Relationship with god Brahman:
Destined by god Brahman for repulsing all
other missiles ({%sarvāstrapratighātāya vihitaṃ%}
{%padmayoninā%}) 7. 172. 32; when withdrawn
by Kṛṣṇa from the stillborn Parikṣit, the
flaming missile returned to Pitāmaha
(Brahman) 14. 69. 1, 3. {@B.@} Gods and
heroes who knew its use: (1) Among the
gods, Indra knew it 5. 47. 100; (2) Among
men: (i) Droṇa: He received it from Rāma
Jāmadagnya; when Droṇa received it, he
became distinguished among men 1. 154. 13;
Droṇa not equalled by any one in the use
of Brahmāstra; Drupada attributed his defeat
at the hands of Droṇa to Droṇa's know-
ledge of Brahmāstra 1. 155. 22; Droṇa un-
equalled in battle by any one because of his
knowledge of Brahmāstra (and other missiles)
({% … brahmāstrādīni yāny api /tāni sarvāṇi%}
{%tiṣṭhanti bhavaty eva viśeṣataḥ%}) 7. 160. 5;
known for his knowledge of Brahmāstra,
Droṇa knew its use and remedy ({%saprayoga-%}
{%cikitsitam%}) 3. 38. 5; 4. 46. 7, 9; 7. 166.
2; (ii) Arjuna: He was taught ({%niṣṭhita%})
Brāhma astra by his teacher (Droṇa) 1.
181. 20; 6. 116. 38; in its use, he never
violated the rules of the Kṣatriyas ({%kṣatra-%}
{%dharmān mahābāhur nākampata dhanaṃ-%}
{%jayaḥ%}) 10. 15. 21; Arjuna was asked by
Indra to learn the Paitāmaha astra (identical,
[Page122-b+ 40]
or different from Brahmāstra ?) 3. 164. 29;
(iii-v) Bhīṣma, Kṛpa, and Aśvatthāman:
According to Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma, Kṛpa and
Aśvatthāman knew its use and remedy ({%sa-%}
{%prayogacikitsitam%}) 3. 38. 5; 4. 46. 7 (Kṛpa
and Aśvatthāman); 4. 46. 9 (Aśvatthāmān);
(vi) Karṇa: Karṇa requested Droṇa to teach
him Brahmāstra together with its secret and
withdrawal, but Droṇa refused to oblige
12. 2. 10, 13; Karṇa, who coveted the Astra
(12. 3. 27, 30), then learnt it in its entirety
({%kṛtsnam%}) from Rāma Jāmadagnya 12. 3.
2; 8. 5. 67; but since Karṇa had told a lie
to obtain its knowledge (12. 3. 30), Rāma
cursed him saying that the missile would flash
to him on all occasions except when he met
his equal and the time of his death had arrived
({%te … brahmāstraṃ pratibhāsyati /anyatra%}
{%vadhakātāt te sadṛśena sameyuṣaḥ%}) 12. 3.
30-31; 5. 61. 2; returning, Karṇa reported
to Duryodhana that he had acquired the
missiles (from Rāma) ({%kṛtāstro 'smi%}) 12. 3.
33; since Karṇa had pacified Rāma, knowledge
of Brahmāstra remained with him; hence
Karṇa assured Duryodhana that he was quite
capable of bearing the burden of the war
({%tatas tad astraṃ mama sāvaśeṣaṃ tasmāt%}
{%samartho 'smi mamaiṣa bhāraḥ%}) 5. 61. 2-4;
according to Yudhiṣṭhira, Karṇa knew the
use and remedy of Brahmāstra 3. 38. 5;
Karṇa boasted to Śalya that he knew the
Brāhma astras (pl. {%astrāṇi … brāhmāṇī%}) 8.
29. 26; (vii) Kṛṣṇa: According to Bhīṣma,
perhaps Kṛṣṇa knew Brāhma and many
other heavenly weapons ({%kṛṣṇo vā devakī-%}
{%putraḥ%}) 6. 116. 39; (viii) Vibhīṣaṇa: He
prayed Brahman that the Brahmāstra might
flash to him although it was not duly taught
to him ({%aśikṣitaṃ ca bhagavan brahmāstraṃ%}
{%pratibhātu me%}) 3. 259. 30; [For its use also
[Page123-a+ 40]
by Yudhiṣṭhira, Kuvalāśva, Bṛhatkṣatra,
Pradyumna, Rāma (Dāśarathi), and Lakṣ-
maṇa see below section {@F@}]. {@C.@} Des-
cription: heavenly ({%divya%}) 3. 271. 16; 7.

matched strength ({%apratimaujas%}) 3. 274. 27;
invincible even in thought ({%manasā tad dhy%}
{%ajayyam%}) 8. 29. 27; highly respected
({%paramasaṃmata%}) 1. 154. 13; to be employ-
ed mentally ({%manasā saṃvidheyam%}) 8. 65.
24; cannot be withstood even by Indra 9.
61. 27. {@D.@} Teaching of the {%astra:%} The
use of the missile was to be taught in full
({%kṛtsnam%}), i. e. together with the mode of
its withdrawal; this is how Rāma Jāmadagnya
taught it to Karṇa after performing due rites
({%tasmai sa vidhivat kṛtsnam brahmāstraṃ%}
{%sanivartanam / provāca%}) 12. 3. 2; Droṇa
learnt from Rāma Jāmadagnya both—the
mode of its employment ({%prayoga%}) and with-
drawal ({%saṃhāra%}) 1. 154. 11; when Karṇa
expressed his desire to learn it from Droṇa
he wanted to know it with its secrets and the
mode of its withdrawal ({%sarahasyanivartanam%})
12. 2. 10; Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Kṛpa, Karṇa and
Aśvatthāman reputed for their knowledge of
the employment of the {%astra%} and its remedy
(i. e. withdrawal) ({%saprayogacikitsitam%}) 3.
38. 5; it could be taught only to a Brāh-
maṇa who had duly observed the prescribed
vow ({%yathāvat caritavrataḥ%}), or a Kṣatriya
who had practised austerities ({%tapasvī%}), but
to none else 12. 2. 13; hence Karṇa told a
[Page123-b+ 40]
lie to Rāma Jāmadagnya about his lineage
while declaring that he was a Bhārgava Brāh-
maṇa 12. 2. 15; 12. 3. 26-30. {@E.@} Use
and withdrawal: At the time of its employ-
ment, {%mantras%} related to Brahmāstra were
recited on an arrow to use it as a charged
missile ({%bāṇavaryaṃ … brahmāstreṇābhi-%}
{%mantritam%}) 3. 274. 24-25; ({%brahmāstra-%}
{%parimantritaiḥ sāyakaiḥ%}) 3. 167. 17; ({%saṃ-%}
{%mantrya%}) 8. 66. 52; these {%mantras%} used
to charge the arrow with the Brāhma (and the
other {%astras%}) were supposed to serve as
the ritual {%mantras%} for the ‘sacrifice to be
performed with weapons’ ({%śastrayajña,%} i. e.
in the war) 5. 139. 31; it was necessary
to support the bow and the arrow with great
might ({%balenātha sa saṃstabhya brahmā-%}
{%straṃ samudairayat%}) 8. 66. 48; at the time of
withdrawing the Brahmāstra (Iṣīkā) employ-
ed by Aśvatthāman, Kṛṣṇa touched water
({%upaspṛśya%}) 14. 68. 16, 14. 69. 1, and also
made a {%satyakriyā%} 14. 68. 19-23. {@F.@}
Uses: (1) In the epic war: (i) by
Droṇa—(a) against Arjuna in order to cut
down the {%bhalla%} arrows 7. 67. 9 ({%samu-%}

Brāhma astra as if to destroy all the Kṣatriyas
({%kṣatriyāṇām abhāvāya brāhmam ātmānam%}
{%āsthitaḥ%}) 7. 165. 14-15; (e) against the
armies of the Pāṇḍavas, the Kekayas, the

{%vikurvāṇaḥ%}) 7. 165. 105; (ii) by Arjuna:
(a) He assured Kṛṣṇa that by employing his
Brāhma astra he would repulse all the missiles
used against him by the protectors of Jaya-
dratha 7. 53. 44; (b) Arjuna cut down with
the rain of arrows released by the use of the
Brahmāstra the shower of arrows released
against him by Droṇa by using the same mis-
sile 7. 67. 12; 7. 163. 46; (c) Arjuna released
({%udīraya-%}) his Brāhma astra to nullify the
effect of the Āgneya astra (7. 172. 14) of
Aśvatthāman 7. 172. 14; (d) against Karṇa:
Arjuna thought of using it for the welfare of
the people ({%śivāya lokasya%}) and the death of
Karṇa ({%vadhāya sauteḥ%}); to do this he sought
the permission of Kṛṣṇa, the gods, Brahman,
Śiva, and of all the knowers of {%brahman (bra-%}
{%hmavid)%} 8. 65. 23-24; Arjuna advised to use
Brahmāstra by Kṛṣṇa 8. 66. 52 ({%visṛj-, prayo-%}
{%jaya.%}); he countered Karṇa's Brahmāstra by
using apparently the same missile ({%tad astram%}

heavenly Brāhma missiles (pl.) against each
other in many ways ({%brāhmāṇi divyāny%}
[Page124-b+ 40]
{%astrāṇy anekaśaḥ%}) 7. 165. 22; Dhṛṣṭdyumna
repelled successfully all missiles used by
Droṇa 7. 165. 23; (vi) by Bṛhatkṣatra (a
Kaikeya): he repulsed Droṇa's Brāhma astra
by the use of the same weapon 7. 101. 13,
(14); (2) Outside the epic war: (i) by
Arjuna: (a) against Kirāta (Śiva); but
it was destroyed by Kirāta 3. 163. 33,
35; (b) against the Nivātakavacas to blow
them away by hundreds and thousands with
the arrows released from the missile 3.
167. 17; (ii) by Aśvatthāman: the {%iṣīkā%}
directed by Aśvatthāman towards the foetus
of Uttarā (10. 15. 31, 33) identified with
Brahmāstra 14. 65. 9; 14. 67. 21; 14. 68. 16;
14. 69. 1; (14. 67. 13, 16); (iii) by Rāma

with it 3. 195. 28; (vii) by Rāma (Dāśa-
rathi): against Rāvaṇa; Rāma, while using

Rāvaṇa, together with his chariot and the
charioteer, were burnt down 3. 274. 24-25,
28; (viii) by Lakṣmaṇa: against the demon
Kumbhakarṇa who was burnt with it 3. 271.
16. {@G.@} Effects of Brahmāstra: When the
Brahmāstra was released: (i) it produced
a very large number of (flaming) arrows 3.
163. 33; 3. 167. 17; 7. 67. 9 ({%bhalla%}), 12;
7. 165. 100 ({%bhalla%}); 8. 33. 25; 8. 65. 24; 8.
66. 53; 8. 67. 8; (ii) it produced fire enough
to heat the worlds and fill the directions
and space with lustre ({%tataḥ saṃtāpito loko%}
{%matprasūtena tejasā / kṣaṇena hi diśaḥ%}
[Page125-a+ 40]
{%khaṃ ca sarvato 'bhividīpitam%}) 3. 163.
34; ({%jajvāla%}) 5. 185. 16; ({%vyomni pādur-%}
{%abhūt tejaḥ%}) 5. 185. 18; ({%dīpayāṃ cakre%})
5. 186. 7; ({%tad astraṃ jvalitam%}) 14. 69. 3;
or to burn the enemy with it 3. 195. 28; 3.
271. 16; 3. 274. 28; 7. 165. 102; or to burn
the enemy's weapon 7. 81. 33; or to burn
the enemy's chariot 9. 61. 18-19; or to burn
the chariot together with horses and charioteer
3. 274. 28; (iii) it produced smoke to fill the
directions 5. 185. 21; (iv) it produced
darkness all over which terrified creatures 7.
132. 33-34; (v) it removed the darkness
produced by the enemy's missile with the
result that cold winds blew and the directions
became clear 7. 172. 32; (vi) all life could
be threatened by it 5. 47. 101; 5. 185. 18,
20-21; 7. 163. 45; (vii) earth, with its
mountains, forests, and trees shook, winds
blew in the opposite direction, and the oceans
were agitated 7. 163. 44; 5. 185. 22; (viii)
gods and other divine and demoniac beings
were heated with its blaze 5. 185. 19; or they
could not remain in the mid-region and they
bewailed 5. 185. 21-22; (ix) under its
influence the Rakṣases infested the residence;
they disappeared when the missile was with-
drawn 14. 69. 2. {@H.@} Withdrawal: Bra-
hmāstra, when employed, either served the
purpose for which it was used, or was
repulsed, or pacified by the counter-use of the
same missile (cf. above sections {@F@} and {@G@});
it was only once destroyed by Kirāta (Śiva) 3.
163. 35; only once when the same missile was
employed by the opponents they clashed in-
between without reaching the respective targets
5. 185. 17; Arjuna withdrew it (= Brahma-
śiras) 10. 15. 1, 5, but it (Iṣīkā identified
with Brahmāstra) could not be withdrawn
by Aśvatthāman as he had not observed the
[Page125-b+ 40]
{%brahmacārivrata%} 10. 15. 7-8; later Kṛṣṇa
withdrew it after sipping water (and making
a {%satyakriyā%}) to revive the still-born child
14. 68. 16, (19-23); 14. 69. 1; when Kṛṣṇa
withdrew the Brahmāstra, brilliant light
emanated from the body of Parikṣit to fill
the room; the evil spirits ({%rakṣāṃsi%}) then left
the house and disappeared, and the mid-region
was filled with the words ‘well-done’ ({%sādhu%}
{%keśava sādhv iti%}) 14. 69. 1-2. {@I.@} Com-
parison: the missile compared with the raised
Brahmadaṇḍa 3. 274. 27; {@J.@} Status:
Inferior to Pāśupatāstra of Śiva 13. 14. 127,
(124). [See {@Iṣīkā, Brahmaśiras<sup>1</sup>@}]
