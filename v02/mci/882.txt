{@Tretā@}¦ f., {@Tretāyuga@} nt.: Name of the
second Yuga among the four Yugas.
{@A.@} Place among the four Yugas:
Second, occurs after Kṛta, hence mentioned
after it ({%pūrvaṃ kṛtayugaṃ nāma tatas%}
{%tretāyugaṃ vibho%}) 6. 11. 4; 6. 11. 3; 12.
224. 18; 12. 323. 50-51; after Tretā follows
Dvāpara ({%tretānirmokṣasamaye dvāpara-%}
{%pratipādane%}) 12. 139. 14; hence the junction
of these two {%yugas%} is referred to ({%tretā-%}
{%dvāparayoḥ sandhau%}) 1. 2. 3; 12. 139. 13;
12. 326. 78. {@B.@} Duration: Mārkaṇḍeya
told Yudhiṣṭhira that the duration of the
Tretā Yuga was three thousand years, with
dawns of three hundred years and twilights
of the same duration ({%trīṇi varṣasahasrāṇi%}

planation of {%saṃdhyā%} and {%saṃdhyāṃśa,%} see
{@Kali,@} Section {@C@}); the same duration was
told by Vyāsa to Śuka without specifically
naming the Yuga but in relation to Kṛta
({%itareṣu sasaṃdhyeṣu sasaṃdhyāṃśeṣu ca%}

Bhagavān (Nārāyaṇa) told Nārada that in
the Tretāyuga, (first), he will be born as
Rāma in the family of the Bhṛgus and will
destroy the Kṣatriyas; and, (next), when the
junction of the Tretā and the Dvāpara will
have arrived he will be born as Rāma, son
of Daśaratha, to be the king of the world

(2) A being without bodily form informed
from the sky (12. 323. 46) Ekata, Dvita
and Trita that when the Kṛtayuga had passed
and the Tretāyuga of the 7th {%manvantara%}
presided over by Manu Vaivasvata will have
arrived they will work as helpers of gods
for achieving a great purpose ({%vaivasvate%}
{%'ntare viprāḥ prāpte tretāyuge tataḥ /%}
{%surāṇāṃ kāryasiddhyarthaṃ sahāyā vai%}
{%bhaviṣyatha%}) 12. 323. 51; (cf. 12. 326. 79-
80); (3) Vyāsa told Yudhiṣṭhira that
Karaṃdhama's son (Avikṣit) was born at
the commencement of the Tretāyuga—he
was glorious, not inferior to Indra, and invin-
cible even by the gods 14. 4. 17; (4) Bhīṣma
told Yudhiṣṭhira that formerly at the junction
of the Tretā and the Dvāpara, a terrible
drought, lasting for twelve years, occurred
due to the working of the fate ({%daivavidhi-%}
{%kramāt%}) 12. 139. 13; when the Tretā was
about to end and the Dvāpara was about
to set in and when the end of the eon was at
hand Indra did not release rain ({%yugānte par-%}
{%yupasthite / tretānirmokṣasamaye dvāpara-%}
{%pratipādane // na vavarṣa sahasrākṣaḥ%})
12. 139. 14-15. {@D.@} Nārāyaṇa-Kṛṣṇa and
Tretā: Bhagavān (Nārāyaṇa) told Mārka-
ṇḍeya that his colour in the Tretāyuga was
yellow ({%pītas tretāyuge mama%}) 3. 187. 31;
but according to Hanūmant, Acyuta was
red in the Tretā ({%raktatāṃ yāti cācyutaḥ%})
3. 148. 23; Bhīṣma told Yudhiṣṭhira that
Kṛṣṇa conformed to {%jñāna%} in the Tretā
({%tretākāle jñānam anuprapannaḥ%}) 13. 143.
9 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 158. 10: {%jñānam%}
{%akartavyakoṭer api upasthānāt tretāyāṃ%}
{%viveka āsīt%}). {@E.@} King and Tretā: When
[Page248-b+ 40]
the king observes {%daṇḍanīti%} only in three
parts and leaves out the fourth, the Tretā-
yuga sets in; the place of the fourth part is
then made up by what is inauspicious and this
part gets associated with the other three,
hence the earth has to be ploughed for the
growth of the plants ({%daṇḍanītyā yadā rājā%}
{%trīn aṃśān anuvartate / caturtham aṃśam%}

{%pacyaiva pṛthivī bhavantyoṣadhyas tathā //%})
12. 70. 14-15; ({%pādonenāpi dharmeṇa gac-%}
{%chet tretāyuge tathā%}) 12. 259. 32; a king is
the cause of the Tretā (as also of the other
three Yugas) ({%tretāyāḥ … / … rājā bhavati%}
{%kāraṇam%}) 5. 130. 16 = 12. 70. 25; (also cf.
{%rājā kālasya kāraṇam%} 12. 70. 6 = 5. 130. 15);
Tretā, like the other three Yugas, depends
on the conduct of the king and hence the
king is called a Yuga ({%rājavṛttāni sarvāṇi%}
{%rājaiva yugam ucyate%}) 12. 92. 6; ({%rāja-%}
{%mūlāni sarvāṇi%}) 12. 139. 10; a king obtains
heaven, but not endlessly, because he intro-
duces Tretā ({%tretāyāḥ karaṇād rājā svargaṃ%}

absence of {%daṇḍanīti%} 12. 65. 24-27;
{@F.@} Tretā and {%dharma:%} In the Tretāyuga
Dharma loses one of its four feet ({%tatra%}
(i. e. {%tretāyuge%}) {%pādacaturtho vai dharm-%}
{%asya na bhaviṣyati%}) 12. 327. 74; ({%pādena%}
{%hrasate dharmaḥ%}) 3. 148. 22-23; in the
Tretā, Dharma is established in three parts
and the remaining one part is affected by
{%adharma (adharmapādaviddhas tu tribhir%}
{%aṃśaiḥ pratiṣṭhitaḥ / tretāyām)%} 3. 188. 11;
also of 12. 259. 32; in the Tretā and the
other two following Yugas the {%dharma%} is
displaced from tradition successively by one
quarter and the {%adharma%} is on increase due
[Page249-a+ 40]
to thefts, falsehood and deceit ({%itareṣv%}
(i. e. {%yugeṣu%}) {%āgamād dharmaḥ pādaśas%}
{%tv avaropyate / caurikānṛtamāyābhir%}
{%adharmaś copacīyate%}) 12. 224. 23; the
{%dharmas%} in the Tretā were different from
those in the Kṛta 12. 224. 26 = 12. 252. 8;
{%jñāna%} was considered to be the best {%dharma%}
for the Tretā ({%tretāyāṃ jñānam uttamam%})
12. 224. 27; Hanūmant told Bhīma that times
in the different Yugas were different 3. 148.
6; Vyāsa told his son Śuka that he had
heard that the study of the Vedas decreased
in every following Yuga and so also the
benefit derived by people from the Veda
({%vedavādāś cānuyugaṃ hrasantīti ca naḥ%}
{%śrutam / … vedasyaiva ca yat phalam%}) 12.
224. 25; the Sātvata {%dharma,%} which flourished
in the Kṛtayuga of the fourth birth of Brah-
man (12. 336. 25), disappeared when the
Tretā returned ({%tataḥ so 'ntardadhe bhūyaḥ%}
{%prāpte tretāyuge punaḥ%}) 12. 336. 35; but
in the seventh birth of Brahman (12. 336.
44) the same Sātvata {%dharma%} was taught
by Vivasvān to Manu 12. 326. 47; according
to Mārkaṇḍeya, however, the {%dharma%} for
the Kṛta, the Tretā and the Dvāpara was
the same 3. 189. 13. {@G.@} Tretā and the
sacrifice: There were no sacrifices in the
Kṛtayuga, but they all, very strong, collected
together appeared in the Tretā and be-
came controllers of those that move (living
beings) and those that do not (non-living
beings) ({%tretāyuge vidhis tv eṣāṃ yajñānāṃ%}

224. 62, 64, 65 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed.

[Page249-b+ 40]
{%śāstāro vedāś ca saṃhatā yajñādyanuṣṭhā-%}
{%panāya sannaddhā āsan%}); Bhagavān (Nārā-
yana) told the gods that the three Vedas
will rule the Tretāyuga and then the animals,
consecrated for the sacrifice, will be killed

{%bhāvanā kriyā aham anena karmaṇā%}
{%idaṃ phalaṃ anena prakāreṇa kariṣyāmīty%}
{%evaṃrūpā tadviṣaya eva saṃkalpo yeṣām%});
Vyāsa told Śuka that at the commencement
of the Tretā the Vedas and the sacrifices
are complete in form ({%tretādau sakalā vedā%}
{%yajñā varṇāśrāmās tathā%}) 12. 230. 14;
(also cf. Maheśvara (Viṣṇu) recommending
the performance of sacrifices for the benefit of
gods, and the gods, on their part, sustaining
the worlds in the Yugas (not named) other
than the Kṛta 12. 327. 53-60). {@H.@} Nature
of the Tretāyuga: Hanūmant told Bhīma
that the times in the Tretā were different from
those in the Kṛta ({%anyaḥ kṛtayuge kālas%}
{%tretāyāṃ dvāpare 'paraḥ%}) 3. 148. 6; Hanū-
mant then described to Bhīma the condition
of the world in the Tretāyuga 3. 148. 22-25
(men are truthful ({%satyapravaṛttāś ca narāḥ%}),
they do not deviate from the path of {%dharma,%}
are given to the practice of austerities and to
giving gifts); the Tretāyuga also described
by Saṃjaya to Dhṛtarāṣṭra (Kṣatriyas are
long-lived, they are great warriors, excellent
archers in war, brave and emperors) 6. 11. 10
[Page250-a+ 40]
({%jāyante kṣatriyāḥ śūrās tretāyāṃ cakra-%}
{%vartinaḥ%}); according to Mārkaṇḍeya the
condition of {%dharma%} in the Tretā is not
different from the one in the Kṛta described
by him ({%eṣa dharmaḥ kṛtayuge treāyām%})
3. 189 13; the ascetics in the Tretā, who
are steady in the {%sattva guṇa,%} have no
doubt whatever whether {%puruṣa, daiva%}
or {%svabhāva%} is the cause of a man's success
in his activities; they see no distinction,
as same people for want of judgement do,
between them ({%pauruṣaṃ kāraṇaṃ kecid%}
{%āhuḥ karmasu mānavāḥ / daviam eke%}
{%praśaṃsanti svabhāvaṃ cāpare janāḥ // … %}
{%trayam etat pṛthagbhūtam avivekaṃ tu%}
{%kecana / … karmasthā viṣamaṃ brūyuḥ%}
{%sattvasthāḥ samadarśinaḥ // tretāyāṃ … %}
{%tapasvinaḥ … %}) 12. 230. 4, 6-7; in the Tretā,
as in the Kṛta, people could get progeny by
mere thought and did not have to cohabit
for this purpose ({%tatra tretāyuge kāle saṃ-%}
{%kalpāj jāyate prajā / na hy abhūt maithuno%}
{%dharmas teṣām api narādhipa //%}) 12. 200.
36; evil tribes like the Talavaras, the
Andhrakas and others in the south and the
Yaunas (Yavanas), the Kāmbojas and others
in the north, unlike in the Kṛtayuga, begin
to roam about on the surface of the
earth from the Tretāyuga onwards ({%naite%}
{%kṛtayuge tāta caranti pṛthivīm imām /%}
{%tretāprabhṛti vartante te janā bharatar-%}
{%ṣabha //%}) 12. 200. 42. {@I.@} Span of life:
Vyāsa told Śuka that people in each suc-
ceeding Yuga lived a quarter years less
than those in the Kṛtayuga who lived for
four hundred years, i. e. in the Tretā they
lived for three hundred years ({%caturvarṣa-%}
{%śatāyuṣaḥ / kṛte tretādiṣv eteṣāṃ pādaśo%}
{%hrasate vayaḥ%}) 12. 224. 24; Vyāsa had heard
that life gradually decreased in each succes-
[Page250-b+ 39]
sive Yuga ({%anuyugaṃ hrasantīti ca naḥ%}
{%śrutam / āyūṃṣi%}) 12. 224. 25; the same
thing was told by Mārkaṇḍeya to Yudhi-
ṣṭhira ({%āyur vīryam atho buddhir balaṃ%}
{%tejaś ca pāṇḍava / manuṣyāṇām anuyugaṃ%}
{%hrasatīti nibodha me%}) 3. 188. 13; however,
Saṃjaya, told Dhṛtarāṣṭra that people lived
for three thousand years in the Tretā ({%āyuḥ-%}
{%saṃkhyā … saṃkhyātā rājasattama / tathā%}
{%trīṇi sahasrāṇi tretāyāṃ manujādhipa //%})
6. 11. 5-6 (apparently, in Saṃjaya's narra-
tion, there is confusion between the dura-
tion of the Tretāyuga (cf. section {@B.@} above)
and the life expectancy of the people in this
Yuga). {@J.@} Simile: The region where
the river Narmadā (f.) passes along the
Vaiḍūrya mountain (m.) is compared with
the conjunction of the Tretā (f.) and the
Dvāpara (m) ({%vaiḍūryaparvataṃ dṛṣṭvā%}
{%narmadām avatīrya ca / sandhir eṣa nara-%}
{%śreṣṭha tretāyā dvāparasya ca //%}) 3. 121.
18-19. {@K.@} Name of Sūrya: Tretā
appears as the 47th name among the hundred
and eight names of Sūrya taught by Dhaumya
to Yudhiṣṭhira 3. 3. 22. [The words Kṛta,
Tretā and Dvāpara occurring in 5. 140. 7-
15 are wrongly interpreted by Nī. (Bom.
Ed. 5. 142. 7-15) as names of the three
Yugas and not as the names of the throws
of dice in a dice-game].
