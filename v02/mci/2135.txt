{@Uttama@}¦ m. (pl.): Name of a people ?
<div n="P">Bhīma in his expedition to the east,
south and north ({%yayau prācīṃ diśaṃ prati%}
2. 26. 1; {%tataḥ prācīṃ diśaṃ bhīmo yayau%}
2. 26. 7; {%tato dakṣiṇam āgamya%} 2. 26. 10;
{%tato himavataḥ pārśve%} 2. 27. 4) conquered
the Uttamas when he went beyond Ayo-
dhyā and Gopālakaccha and then to the
foot of the Himālayas ({%tato gopālakacchaṃ%}
{%ca sottamān api cottarān … vyajayat pra-%}
{%bhuḥ%}) 2. 27. 3; (since in 2. 27. 11 there is a
reference to Dakṣiṇamallas, and in 2. 27. 3
{%mallānām adhipaṃ caiva%} follows immedi-
ately after {%sottamān api cottarān,%} it is very
likely that {%uttarān%} and {%uttamān%} refer to the
northern and most northern Mallas; the
passage would then mean that Bhīma
conquered the king of Mallas, together with
the Uttara and Uttama Mallas; Edgerton,
however, takes Uttara and Uttama as
names of different peoples, see his note on
this stanza in Cr. Ed. Vol. II, p. 501).
