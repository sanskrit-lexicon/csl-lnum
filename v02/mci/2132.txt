{@Īrin@}¦ m. (pl.): Designation of the des-
cendents of king Īrin ?
<div n="P">Mentioned by Nārada among the holy
royal sages ({%tasyāṃ rājarṣayaḥ puṇyāḥ%} 2.
8. 7; {%ete rājarṣayaḥ puṇyāḥ%} 2. 8. 25) who
were present in the Sabhā of Yama; there
were a hundred of them ({%īriṇāṃ vairiṇāṃ%}
{%śatam%}) 2. 8. 22 (Nī., however, seems to
take it to mean the name of a king; he justi-
fies the use of plural on the ground that
there were many Īrins, of the same form and
function, belonging to different Kalpas, cf.
his remark on Bom. Ed. 2. 8. 23: {%purāṇeṣu%}
{%prāyeṇādhikāriṇām eva kīrtanāt teṣāṃ ca%}
{%pratikalpaṃ samānarūpakarmatvād aneka-%}
{%kalpaṃ dharmasabhāvāsināṃ teṣāṃ bahu-%}
{%tvaṃ yuktam%}).
