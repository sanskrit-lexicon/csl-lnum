tion of Vāraṇāvata, the Pāṇḍavas desired to
go there; Dhṛtarāṣṭra permitted the Pāṇḍa-
vas to go to Vāraṇāvata to see the festival
and enjoy themselves there; they might give
gifts to Brāhmaṇas and singers as desired
and then return to Hāstinapura 1. 131. 7-
10; Yudhiṣṭhira told Bhīṣma and others his
wish to live in Vāraṇāvata for some days

[Page564-a+ 41]
keys 1. 132. 6-7; Purocana was to build
at Vāraṇāvata for the Pāṇḍavas a house
