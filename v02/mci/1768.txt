than Kurukṣetra ({%puṇyam āhuḥ kuru-%}

by visiting Sarasvatī people have gone to

they visit Sarasvatī they never grieve in this
or the other world ({%sarasvatīṃ prāpya janāḥ%}
{%suduṣkṛtāḥ / sadā na śocanti paratra ceha%}
{%ca //%}) 9. 53. 34-35; according to the Gāthās
sung by Yayāti (12. 148. 8) if one bathes
and drinks water at Pṛthūdaka on Sarasvatī
one does not have to worry about death in
near future ({%naiva śvomaraṇaṃ tapet%}) 12.
148. 10; this was also told by Ruṣaṅgu to
his sons 9. 38. 29; by visiting Sarasvatī and
by satisfying there gods and manes one re-
joices undoubtedly in the worlds of Sarasvatī
({%sārasvateṣu lokeṣu modate nātra saṃ-%}

Dvaipāyana, Śuka, Kṛṣṇa, Yakṣas and many
others became perfected in Yoga ({%yoga-%}
{%siddhāḥ%}) 9. 48. 18-20; one should live on
Sarasvatī for a month 3. 81. 3; (3) By
bathing at the confluence of Gaṅgā and Sara-
svatī one gets the fruit of an Aśvamedha and
goes to heaven 3. 82. 34; by visiting the place
where Sarasvatī meets the ocean ({%sarasvatyāḥ%}
{%sāgarasya ca saṃgame%}) one gets the fruit
of gifting a thousand cows and shining always
with lustre like that of fire he is glorified in
heaven ({%svargaloke mahīyate / dīpyamāno%}
{%'gnivan nityaṃ prabhayā%}); living there for
three nights one should satisfy manes and
gods; he thereby shines like the moon ({%pra-%}

of an Aśvamedha 3. 80. 79-80; at the con-
fluence of Sarasvatī (the other river is not

and Cāraṇas, visit it on the fourteenth day
of the bright half of Caitra 3. 80, 130; it is
recommended that one should live at Kuru-

to tell him the origin, the merits, the reward
of visiting them, and how one achieves suc-

deserted by Sarasvatī would be bereft of
holiness ({%apuṇya eṣa bhavatu deśaś tyaktas%}
{%tvayā śubhe%}) 13. 139. 26; cows act like
Sarasvatīs (pl.) in delivering persons from

among the holy places by visiting which the

Plakṣaprasravaṇa tīrtha at the source of
Sarasvatī ({%prabhavaṃ ca sarasvatyāḥ pla-%}

Plakṣaprasravaṇa he heard about the destruc-
tion in the battle; so he descended from the
mountain Himavant and went to hte place
where the duel between Bhīma and Duryo-
dhana was to take place; he was delighted to
look at Sarasvatī again and again 9. 53. 33,

two stanzas praising the qualities of Sarasvatī

at night in a well which was not far away from
Sarasvatī 9. 35. 24-25; when Trita requested
gods to rescue him from the well, Sarasvatī,
full of waves, leapt up and threw Trita out of
the well ({%tatra cormimatī rājann utpapāta%}
{%sarasvatī / tayotkṣiptas tritas tasthau%}) 9. 35,

flowing towards the east, returned from a
certain {%tīrtha%} to the west out of her regard
for the sages living in the Naimiṣa forest;
formerly, in the Kṛta age, many sages from
the Naimiṣa forest, after completing {%satra%}
of twelve years, flocked to Sarasvatī for
pilgrimage ({%tīrthakāraṇāt%}); on account of
their large numbers the {%tīrthas%} on the south
bank of Sarasvatī appeared like cities
({%ṛṣīṇāṃ bahulatvāt tu sarasvatyā viśāṃ%}
{%pate / tīrthāni nagarāyante kūle vai dakṣiṇe%}

of Sarasvatī as far as the Samantapañcaka
on account of their love for {%tīrthas (tīrtha-%}

the river shone ({%aśobhata saricchreṣṭhā%});
the sages, dwelling near Sarasvatī, beautified
the river as do gods the Ganges ({%śobhayan-%}

when other sages arrived there to perform a
{%satra%} they found no place in Kurukṣetra;

Maṅkaṇaka, who was observing chastity
({%kaumārabrahmacāriṇaḥ%}) saw by chance
[Page473-a+ 40]
a woman taking bath in Sarasvatī his seed
fell into water; when it was collected in a
jar by the sage, the seed got divided into
seven parts; from it were born seven seers,
from whom sprang the Maruts ({%tatrarṣayaḥ%}

Brāhmaṇa Ruṣaṅgu, when he decided to
give up his body in old age, asked his sons
to carry him to Pṛthūdaka, a {%tīrtha%} on
Sarasvatī; when he was carried to the river
by his sons, he took bath there ({%āplutaḥ%})

told his sons: “one who gives up his body

have to worry about iminent death” ({%nainaṃ%}

Dālbhya, when insulted by Dhṛtarāṣṭra, son
of Vicitravīrya (9. 40. 1; probably different
from the son of Ambikā and the father of the
Kauravas), kindled fire at a desolate {%tīrtha%} on
Sarasvatī ({%avakīrṇe sarasvatyās tīrthe pra-%}

giving offerings of flesh of dead animals;
as a result the kingdom of Dhṛtarāṣṭra began
to waste away; he was therefore advised to
propitiate Baka in a bower in the water of
Sarasvatī ({%apāṃ kuñje sarasvatyās taṃ%}
{%prasādaya pārthiva%}) and request Baka to
forgive him for his fault 9. 40. 10-21; (also
see No. 27 below); (10) For the sacrifice
of Yayāti, son of Nahuṣa, Sarasvatī brought
in her currents clarified butter and milk
({%ghṛtaṃ payaś ca susrāva%}); in that sacri-
[Page473-b+ 40]
fice, Sarasvatī fulfilled the wishes of Brāh-
maṇas by producing many juices (?) in
accordance with their wishes ({%yatra yatra%}
{%hi yo vipro yān yān kāmān abhīpsati /%}
{%tatra tatra saricchreṣṭhā sasarja subahūn%}
{%rasān%}) 9. 40. 30, 33; (11) Viśvāmitra
practised severe austerities on an excellent
{%tīrtha%} (not named) of Sarasvatī and became
a Brāhmaṇa 9. 39. 23, 28-29; the {%āśrama%}
of Vasiṣṭha was at Sthāṇutīrtha on the
eastern bank of Sarasvatī and that of
Viśvāmitra on the western bank; at the
{%tīrtha%} Vasiṣṭhāpavāha, Viśvāmitra was able
to displace Vasiṣṭha with the help of severe
austerities ({%vasiṣṭhaṃ cālayām āsa tapa-%}
{%sogreṇa%}) 9. 41. 4, 8; Viśvāmitra wanted
Sarasvatī to bring Vasiṣṭha to him swiftly
so that he could kill him (Vasiṣṭha); Viśvā-
mitra therefore thought of Sarasvatī; she
appeared before him, trembling with fear, and
asked him what she might do for him; Viśvā-
mitra told the river what he wanted her to do;
hearing that Sarasvatī was pained; she just
stood there all the while shaking with fear;
Viśvāmitra asked her again to bring Vasiṣṭha
quickly to him; she was worried what
to do as she was afraid of the curses
of both the sages; she went to Vasiṣṭha
and informed him what Viśvāmitra's desire
was; Vasiṣṭha saw her pale and lean and
told her to carry him to Viśvāmitra and save
herself from the latter's curse; hearing that
Sarasvatī reflected on what she might
do which would turn out beneficial to
Vasiṣṭha as he had been merciful to her;
when she saw on the other bank Viśvāmitra
engaged in giving offerings she thought that
to be the right moment to act swiftly ({%saras-%}
{%vaty abhyacintayat / idam antaram ity eva%}
9. 41. 26-27); she washed away a part of
[Page474-a+ 40]
her bank on the side of Vasiṣṭha so that he
was carried on her current to the {%āśrama%} of
Viśvāmitra; while he was being thus carried
Vasiṣṭha praised Sarasvatī (Sarasvatī's praise
9. 41. 29-31); Sarasvatī informed Viśvāmitra
that she had brought Vasiṣṭha; Viśvāmitra
began to look for a weapon to kill Vasiṣṭha;
being afraid of the sin of killing a Brāhmaṇa
Sarasvatī carried Vasiṣṭha back to the eastern
bank ({%brahmahatyābhayān nadī / apovāha%}
{%vasiṣṭhaṃ tu prācīṃ diśam atandritā%} 9. 41.
34); she thus did what both the sages asked
her to do, but Viśvāmitra was deceived;
enraged, he cursed the river to flow with
blood; as a result Sarasvatī flew with water
mixed with blood for a year; the sages, gods,
Gandharvas and Apsarases were excessively
pained to see Sarasvatī in that condition; this
is how the {%tīrtha%} Vasiṣṭhāpavāha came into
existance 9. 41. 11-39; when Sarasvatī
carried blood with water in her current,
Rākṣasas came there and were happy to drink
blood from the river water; once, some sages,
while visiting the {%tīrthas,%} came to Vasiṣṭhā-
pavāha they saw the Rākṣasas drinking
blood from the river; they decided to do
something to save the river; they invited
Sarasvatī and found out from her the cause
of the disturbed condition of the {%tīrtha%}
({%kāraṇaṃ brūhi kalyāṇi kimarthaṃ te%}
{%hrado hy ayam / evam ākulatāṃ yātaḥ%}
9. 42. 9); on hearing the cause, they decided
to free the river from the curse; by their
mere word Sarasvatī returned to her normal
condition and her water was as placid as
before ({%teṣāṃ tu vacanād eva prakṛtisthā%}
{%sarasvatī / prasannasalilā jajñe yathā pūr-%}
{%vam tathaiva hi%} 9. 42. 13); the excellent river
shone as before; since the river water was
normal again the Rākṣasas were afflicted by
[Page474-b+ 40]
hunger and they requested the sages to relieve
them from that condition; the sages praised
the river and urged her to relieve the Rākṣasas
from their condition; knowing what the sages
wanted Sarasvatī brought to her current the
river Aruṇā ({%aruṇām ānayām āsa svāṃ%}
{%tanum%}); bathing in that river the Rākṣasas
abandoned their bodies and went to heaven
9. 42. 1-25; (12) While Dadhīca was
giving offerings to gods on the bank of Saras-
vatī ({%tasya tarpayato devān sarasvatyām%}
9. 50. 8), the Apsaras Alambusā, sent by
Indra to disturb the austerities of Dadhīca,
approached him; seeing her divine form the
seed of Dadhīca spilled into water of Sara-
svatī; the river held it in her womb as she
desired to have a son and also because the seed
might not be wasted ({%kukṣau cāpy adadhat … %}
{%tad retaḥ … putrahetor mahānadī%} 9. 50. 10;
{%na vināśam idaṃ gacchet tvatteja iti niśca-%}
{%yāt%} 9. 50. 14); when Sarasvatī delivered the
child at proper time she took him to Dadhīca;
seeing Dadhīca seated in the assembly of
sages she handed over the child to him saying
it was his son whom she bore out of her
devotion to the sage ({%brahmarṣe tava putro%}
{%'yaṃ tvadbhaktyā dhārito mayā%} 9. 50. 12);
Dadhīca accepted the child and was very much
delighted; he then gave the following boon
to Sarasvatī: “all gods, manes, Gandharvas
and Apsarases will be satisfied when they
receive offerings of your water ({%tṛptiṃ yā-%}
{%syanti subhage tarpyamāṇās tavāmbhasā%} 9.
50. 17); the sage then praised the great river
(9. 50. 19-20); he declared that this her
son will be known as Sārasvata after the
mother's name ({%tavaiva nāmnā prathitaḥ%}
{%putras te lokabhāvanaḥ%} 9. 50. 21); he also
declared that by his grace Sarasvatī would
be the holiest of all holy rivers ({%puṇyābhyaś%}

having received a boon from him Sarasvatī
went away taking her son with her 9. 50.
5-24; (13) Once there was drought lasting
for twelve years; when Sārasvata, like other
people, wanted to leave the place and go else-
where in search of food, Sarasvatī told him
not to leave the place; she assured him to
provide food to him in the form of excellent
fish; Sārasvata therefore lived there; he ate
the food offered by the river and preserved the
Vedas 9. 50. 36-38; (14) Bharata, son of
Duḥṣyanta and Śakuntalā, bound twenty
horses for sacrifice on the bank of Sarasvatī
({%sarasvatīṃ viṃśatiṃ ca%}) 12. 29. 41; (15)
Gārgya satisfied Śiva by offering a mental
sacrifice on the bank of Sarasvatī ({%sarsvatyās%}
{%taṭe tuṣṭo manoyajñena pāṇḍava%}); Śiva
then gave him wonderful knowledge of time
({%kālajñānaṃ mamādbhutam%}), a thousand
sons, equal to Gārgya, versed in the exposition
of Brahman ({%tulyaṃ mama sahasraṃ tu%}
{%sutānāṃ brahmavādinām%}), and very long
life to him and to his sons 13. 18. 25-26;
(16) Nahuṣa invited Agastya, who was
then on the bank of Sarasvatī, to come to
him and draw his carriage ({%vāhanāyājuhāva%}
{%saḥ / drutaṃ sarasvatīkūlāt%}) 13. 103. 12;
(17) Utathya, angered at the abduction
of his wife by Varuṇa, began to drink up
water everywhere, compelled the ocean to
recede and asked Sarasvatī: “Be invisible
in a desert land; when deserted by you let
the land be unholy” ({%adṛśyā gaccha bhīru%}
{%tvaṃ sarasvati maruṃ prati /apuṇya eṣa%}

seen by Mārkaṇḍeya in the belly of the Bāla
[Page475-b+ 40]
(3. 186. 83 = Nārāyaṇa 3. 187. 3) 3. 186.
96; (19) Janamejaya asked Vaiśaṃpāyana
the origin of the Saptasārasvata tīrtha;
Vaiśaṃpāyana then began the narration of
a past event in which Sarasvatī, when invited
for a sacrifice at different places, appeared
there under different names 9. 37. 1, 3-4; (i)
When Pitāmaha (Brahmadeva) thought of
Sarasvatī she first appeared as Suprabhā at
Puṣkara to make the sacrifice of Pitāmaha
on this earth highly fruitful ({%mahāphalaḥ%});
Sarasvatī thus showed her respect for Pitāmaha
({%pitāmahaṃ mānayantīm%}) 9. 37. 11-14;
(ii) When Sarasvatī was thought of by the
sages performing a {%satra%} at Naimiṣa forest
she appeared there as Kāñcanākṣī to help the
sages ({%sahāyārthaṃ mahātmanām%}); she was
honoured by the sages ({%pūjitā%}) 9. 37. 15-18;
(iii) When she appeared for the sacrifice of
Gaya among the people of Gayā ({%gayeṣu%}),
sages called her Viśālā 9. 37. 20; (iv) In
the sacrifice of Auddālaki in the northern Ko-
salas when she was thought of by Auddālaka
the river appeared there for him ({%ājagāma%}
{%saricchreṭhā taṃ deśam ṛṣikāraṇāt%}) under
the name Manohradā (Mānasahradā in 9. 37.
4) since she was carried there by the sages
through the agency of their mind ({%sā hi%}
{%tair manasā hṛtā%}); the river was honoured
there by the sages ({%pūjyamānā munigaṇaiḥ%})
9. 37. 21-23; (v) In the Ṛṣabhadvīpa the
river appeared with the name Suveṇu 9. 37.
24; (vi) In the sacrifice of Kuru at
Kurukṣetra. when invoked by Vasiṣṭha, the
river Sarasvatī appeared with the name Ogha-
vatī 9. 37. 24-25; (vii) In the sacrifice
of Dakṣa at Gaṅgādvāra the river appear-
ed as Vimalodā 9. 37. 26 (Vimalodakā
9. 37. 4); when Brahman offered a sacri-
fice again he called the river back on the
[Page476-a+ 40]
Himavant mountain; the {%tīrtha%} where all
the seven forms of the river got united
became famous as Saptasārasvata 9. 37. 26-
28; (20) When the chariot of Śiva was
got ready for his fight with Asuras fighting
from the Tripuras the Mahānadīs became
its hind parts ({%jaṅghās tasya mahānadīḥ%})
8. 24. 69 (Sarasvatī could be one of these
‘big rivers’; but cf. the next); (21) Saras-
vatī was the {%parirathya%} (?) of Śiva's
chariot 8. 24. 75 (however, according to Nī.

with them Skanda and went to Himavant
and the river Sarasvatī for his consecration
as the general of their army 9. 43. 50-52;
they consecrated Skanda at Sthāṇutīrtha on
Sarasvatī 9. 41. 6-7; gods consecrated Skanda
as their general with the holy waters of Saras-
vatī having heavenly waters ({%sarasvatībhiḥ%}

a sacrifice and honoured Sarasvatī and then
established Sthāṇutīrtha on the river 9. 41. 8;
(26) When Indra was pursued by the head
of Namuci, Pitāmaha (Brahman) asked Indra
[Page476-b+ 39]
to offer a sacrifice and to bathe in Aruṇā;
Indra then offered a sacrifice in the Kuñja of
Sarasvatī and bathed in Aruṇā ({%sarasvatyāḥ%}

Dālbhya on the river Sarasvatī (9. 39. 32;

for the prosperity of gods and the decline of
Asuras ({%asurāṇām abhāvāya bhāvāya ca%}

it to Śiva as these rivers were well-versed
