1. 215. 7. {@D.@} Agni's desire to burn the
forest: Agni approached Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna to

25; 3. 46. 40; 4. 34. 14; {@E.@} Arjuna's

1. 220. 31-32; 20-21; 1. 223. 22; they were left
behind in the Khāṇḍava by their mother as they

{@I.@} Why was the forest burnt: Destruction
of the Khāṇḍava was ordained — this was told
to Indra by an invisible voice ({%vāg uvācā-%}
{%śarīriṇī … diṣṭaṃ cānupaśyaitat khāṇḍava-%}
{%sya vināśanam%}) 1. 219. 12, 18; when Arjuna
was born an invisible voice had foretold that
Agni would burn the forest with the help of
Arjuna 1. 114. 28, 32; 8. 48. 7; but Agni is
said to have burnt the forest to make the world
free from fear ({%bhagavān api tigmāṃśuḥ%}
