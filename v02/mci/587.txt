{@Śakaṭavyūha@}¦ m.: Name of a {%vyūha%}
(a particular arrangement of the army)
7. 6. 15.
<div n="P">Droṇa arranged the Kaurava army in the
form of the Śakaṭavyūha on the eleventh day
of the war; Jayadratha, the Kaliṅga king (not
named), and Vikarṇa stood on the right side
({%dakṣiṇa pārśva%}); at the extremity of the
right wing ({%prapakṣa%}) was Śakuni, assisted
by excellent horsemen from the Gandhāra
[Page144-b+ 40]
country who fought with sharp {%prāsas;%} Kṛpa,
Kṛtavarman, Citrasena, and Viviṃśati, with
Duḥśāsana to lead them ({%duḥśāsanamukhāḥ%}),
stood on its left side ({%savya pārśva%}); at the
extremity of the left wing ({%prapakṣa%}) stood
the Kāmbojas, led by Sudakṣiṇa, who fought
on horses, as also the Śakas and the Yavanas;
apparently in between the two sides were
stationed the Madras, the Trigartas, the
Ambaṣṭhas, warriors who came from the west
and the north, the Śibis, the Śūrasenas, the
Śūdras, the Maladas, the Sauvīras, and the
Kitavas, all of whom were led by Duryo-
dhana ({%tavātmajaṃ puraskṛtya%}); Karṇa
took position in front of Duryodhana
and was at the head of all the archers
({%pramukhe sarvadhanvinām%}) 7. 6. 1-8;
in this Vyūha, Karṇa was in front of the army
({%tāvakānāṃ mukhaṃ karṇaḥ%}) 7. 6. 21;
from the description of the start of that
day's battle it is clear that Droṇa also stood
at the head of the army 7. 6. 32-36; this
Vyūha of the Kauravas was opposed by the
Pāṇḍavas with the Krauñcavyūha 7. 6. 15.
