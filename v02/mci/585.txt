{@Vyāla@}¦ m.: Name (?) of a particular
kind of the arrangement of army ({%vyūha%}).
<div n="P">On the fourth day of the war the Kau-
ravas arranged their army according to this
Vyūha; Bhīṣma led it, and he was followed
all around by Droṇa, Duryodhana, Bāhlika
(Somadatta), Durmarṣaṇa, Citrasena, Jayad-
ratha and other kings with their armies;
the Kaurava army looked like the sky full
of clouds at the advent of the rainy season;
that army, protected by Bhīṣma, rushed
towards Arjuna like a mighty current of a
river; its great strength lay concealed in
various ways and it had a large number of
elephants, horses, foot-soldiers and chariots
on either side ({%taṃ vyālanānāvidhagū-%}

6. 60. 7) 6. 56. 1-7; it appears that this
Vyūha was opposed by the Pāṇḍavas with
their Ardhacandravyūha (not directly
mentioned) which they had adopted on the
previous day and in which the Pāñcāla and
the Cedi chiefs took their positions as before
