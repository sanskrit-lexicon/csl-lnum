where Duryodhana, whose thighs were

vowed that he would not take off his armour
unless he had killed all the Pāñcālas led by
Dhṛṣtadyumna and the Pāṇḍavas with their
house attendants ({%ahatvā sarvapāñcālān%}

2. 180; where the trio, led by Drauṇi, killed
the Pāñcālas and their attendants while they
were confidently asleep at night; where the
five Pāṇḍavas and Sātyaki were saved as
they were protected by the might of Kṛṣṇa
({%kṛṣṇabalāśrayāt%} 1. 2. 182) and all the
rest perished; where Draupadī, grieved by
the death of her sons, and pained at the
killing of her father and brothers, resolved
to fast unto death; where, at the instance
of Draupadī, Bhīma pursued Aśvatthāman;
where Aśvatthāman, afraid of Bhīmasena,
released the missile (Brahmaśiras) against
him saying it was for the destruction of the
Pāṇḍava’ ({%apāṇḍavāyeti ruṣā drauṇir%}
{%astram avāsṛjat%} 1. 2. 185); but Kṛṣṇa,
wanting to neutralize (the effect of) those
words said ‘let that not happen’ ({%maivam%}

{%vacaḥ%} 1. 2. 186); whereupon Phālguna

{%rājñām udakadānike%} 1. 2. 187); where Pṛthā
(Kuntī) narrated the birth of her son who

the {%ślokas%} to be eight hundred and seventy
1. 2. 189-190; the {%parvan%} (? or the incident

with the son of Droṇa (Aśvatthāman), killed
those who were asleep ({%sauptike ye ca nihatāḥ%}
{%suptānena durātmanā // droṇaputrasahāyena%}
