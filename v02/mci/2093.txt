(8) (According to Bhūriśravas, however,
the Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas could be trea-

{%duryodhanam upāgamat%}) 5. 19. 17; (20)
Saṃjaya, while conveying the message
from the Kauravas told Yudhiṣṭhira that he
(Saṃjaya) would consider Yudhiṣṭhira's
living by begging in the kingdom of
the Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis better than
waging a war for kingdom ({%bhaikṣacaryām%}

after killing Droṇa) ({%yāpyas tvam asi … sar-%}

When Kṛṣṇa returned to Dvārakā after the
war, Bhojas, Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas came out
to meet him; Kṛṣṇa honoured them and en-
quired about their well-being ({%upayātaṃ tu%}

told about the curse of the sages, Viśvā-
mitra and others, to the effect that an iron
pestle would be born to Sāmba for the des-
truction of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas; accord-
ingly Sāmba gave birth to a large pestle of
the size of a {%kiṃkara%} (shaft of a chariot ?)

and Andhakas were maintaining vigil over
their conduct, Kāla always moved round
their houses; many bad omens including
blowing of fierce strong winds, occurred
indicating the destruction of Vṛṣṇis and
Andhakas; also whitish pigeons having red
feet, goaded by Kāla, moved over their
houses; when the conch Pāñcajanya was
sounded in their houses, asses of harsh
voice brayed in response ({%evaṃ prayatamā-%}

Andhakas, wishing to go out with their
wives, decided to go for a {%tīrthayātrā;%}
so they got ready food and drink, which
included meat and wine, which they took
with them; fond of liquor they went out of
the town in vehicles, or on horses and ele-
phants; they stayed at Prabhāsa; hearing
that they had settled near the sea, Uddhava
took leave of them; the Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka
heroes saw Uddhava leaving them; the
food which was prepared for Brāhmaṇas,
they gave to monkeys; then a great
drinking bout began at Prabhāsa in which
musical instruments were played upon and
actors and dancers took part ({%tato jiga-%}

in a state of drunkenness struck Yuyu-
dhāna (Sātyaki) with pots from which
food was eaten; Bhojas then fought with
Pradyumna, who had intervened to save
Sātyaki, and Andhakas attacked Sātyaki,
and killed both of them; Kṛṣṇa then killed
those Bhojas and Andhakas who were in
front of him with the pestle which arose
out of the {%erakā%} grass held by Kṛṣṇa in
his hand; whoever of them held the {%erakā%}
in his hand, it became (a pestle like) {%vajra;%}
the Andhakas, Bhojas, Śaineyas and Vṛṣṇis
killed each other with that {%vajra%}-like pestle;
in the tumult, the son killed the father and
the father his son; Kukuras and Andhakas

would take with him Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas
to Śakraprastha; there Vajra would be their
king; when Arjuna left Dvārakā, servants,
elephant- and chariot-drivers of Andhakas
and Vṛṣṇis, as also their sons, followed
him; many thousands of women of Bhojas,
Andhakas and Vṛṣṇīs, who had lost their
husbands left Dvārakā to follow Arjuna;
on their way to Indraprastha when they
were attacked by Mlecchas (also called
Dasyus 16. 8. 44, 47, 58, 60 or Ābhīras 16.

Vyāsa consoled Arjuna by saying that the
great heroes among Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas
were destroyed due to the curse of a
Brāhmaṇa and hence Arjuna should not
grieve over the event; it was ordained for
