Mārkaṇḍeya, while instructing Yudhiṣṭhira,
told him that to honour the old injunction
[Page274-b+ 40]
laid down by Brahman the Saptarṣis shine

injunction considering himself to be strong

wars: Bhīṣma told Yudhiṣṭhira that the
soldiers in the army, while fighting, should
keep the constellation Ursa Major at the
back and remain steady like mountains;
this way one could wish to win even the
unconquerable opponents ({%saptarṣīn pṛṣṭha-%}

16. {@D.@} Omens: Among the omens
noticed by Vyāsa before the war one was
related to the position of the two planets

and Ketu ?) who obscured the brilliance of
the lofty stars of the Ursa Major ({%grahau%}

Brāhmaṇa instructed his wife that there was
only one relative, no other; he dwelt in our
heart; (in saying this) the Brāhmaṇa was only
repeating what the relative within had said
to him: instructed by the relative within
people have relatives; they shine (like ?) the
stars of the Ursa Major ({%eko bandhur nāsti%}
