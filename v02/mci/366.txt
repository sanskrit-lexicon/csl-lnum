1. 60. 67; 3. 263. 1; 3. 266 48. {@B.@} Descri-
ption and Eminence: Of terrible and fear-
ful appearance he looked like a peak of a

({%khayādhipa%} 3. 266. 48; {%pakṣirāj%} 3. 266.
54). {@C.@} Meeting with monkey-chiefs:
He approached Hanūmant and other monkey-
chiefs with a view to eating them when they
talked about Jaṭāyu; he asked them who they
[Page064-b+ 39]
were talking about his brother and introduced
himself to them as Saṃpāti and the elder
brother ({%jyeṣṭho bhrātā%} 3. 266. 48) of
Jaṭāyu; he informed them about his contest
with his brother in which they flew up to the
assembly hall of the Sun ({%ādityasaṃsad%}
3. 266. 48); as a result his wings were burnt
but not of Jaṭāyus; with his wings burnt
down he fell on the mountain Malaya;
he had not met his brother for quite a long
time; he was then informed by Hanūmant
and others that his brother was dead;
dejected to hear the sad news he asked the
monkey-chiefs about Rāma and Sītā and how
his brother got killed; on hearing Rāma's story
Saṃpāti asked the monkey-chiefs to get up
and told them that he knew Rāvaṇa and had
seen his Laṅkā on the other shore of the ocean;
he was sure that Sītā would be there and had
no doubt about it; having heard Saṃpāti's
words Hanūmant and others took counsel
among themselves how they could cross the
ocean 3. 266. 46-56; 3. 147. 33 (Saṃpāti not
named, but referred to as {%gṛdhra%}).
