{@Puruṣasūkta@}¦ nt.: Name of a section
({%adhyāyas%} 12. 338-339) in the Śāntiparvan
12. 338. 5 (perhaps part of the Nārāyaṇīya
since the Puruṣa, also called {%puruṣaḥ virāṭ%}
12. 338. 21, is identified with Nārāyaṇa 12.
339. 14).
<div n="P">Vaiśaṃpāyana narrated it to Janamejaya
when the latter asked him: “Who is the
foremost Puruṣa and who is the source (of
the universe) ? ({%ko hy atra puruṣaḥ śreṣṭhaḥ%}
{%ko vā yonir ihocyate%}) 12. 338. 1; Vaiśaṃ-
pāyana narrated it to Janamejaya by the
favour of his teacher Vyāsa to whom he paid
obeisance 12. 338. 7, 4; the Puruṣasūkta is
known in the Vedas as {%ṛta%} and {%satya%} 12.
338. 5; Vyāsa, the best among the sages
({%ṛṣisiṃha%} 12. 338. 5), has summarized in it
what the sages Kapila and others have ex-
pounded in their {%śāstras%} 12. 338. 6-7; origi-
nally the Puruṣottama (12. 338. 23) was
described by the four-faced Brahman to his
three-eyed son Rudra, hence called an old
Itihāsa ({%itihāsaṃ purātanam%}) 12. 338. 8-25;
12. 339. 1-21.
