{@Rudrāṇām astrāṇi@}¦ nt. pl.: Missiles
special to the Rudras.
<div n="P">When Arjuna reached Indra's residence,
the Rudras, along with the other group-gods,
agreed to give their missiles to him 3. 164.
49-50; they figure in a bad omen: when
Garuḍa flew up from a mountain top to
[Page130-a+ 40]
fetch Soma from the heaven, there occurred
bad omens for the gods, one of them being
that the missile ({%praharaṇam%}) of the Rudras
clashed with those of the Vasus, the Ādityas,
the Sādhyas, the Maruts and the other hosts
of gods ({%ye cānye devatāgaṇāḥ%}); such a
thing had never happened before 1. 26. 29-30.
