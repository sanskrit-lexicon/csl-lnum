{@Lomaśa@}¦ m.: A cat.
{@A.@} Residence: He lived on the branches
of a banyan tree in a certain forest 12. 136. 19,
22; also in a hole ({%svabilam%}) at the foot of
the tree 12. 136. 190. {@B.@} Description: Had
sharp front teeth and eyes resembling the
cat's-eye gem; he was intelligent, eloquent
({%vākyasaṃpanna%}) and knew the import of
speech {%vākyatattvajña%}) 12. 136. 65, 64, 94.
{@C.@} Palita-Lomaśa Episode: A mouse,
Palita, also lived in a hole at the foot of the
banyan tree; Lomaśa, although normally
watchful ({%apramatta%} 12. 136. 25), was once
caught in a trap ({%unmātha%} 12. 136. 23) fixed
by a Cāṇḍāla; when this happened Palita
began to move about freely, got a piece of
flesh, and started eating it on the top of the
trap while smiling inwardly at the cat caught
in the trap below; just then the mouse
Palita saw his two other enemies, an
ichneumon on the ground and an owl on the
tree, wanting to get him; Palita immediately
realized that the cat, his third enemy in
distress, was his only means of escape; he
therefore offered the cat to cut off the cords
[Page050-b+ 41]
of the net if the cat in return promised not
to injure him when he moved near the cat
to protect himself from the ichneumon and
the owl; Palita wished that Lomaśa remained
alive and expected a similar response from
Lomaśa ({%tava jīvitam icchāmi tvaṃ mame-%}
{%cchasi jīvitam%} 12. 136. 59); the cat too
knew that be by himself was almost at
the end of his life ({%tām avasthām avek-%}
{%ṣyāntyām%} 12. 136. 64) and hence spoke in
conciliatory terms to the mouse; Lomaśa
told the mouse that he had given up his
pride and that he was Palita's devotee and
pupil; he was prepared to carry out Palita's
order and work in his interest; he requested
Palita to do what would serve the purpose
of both of them; Palita then suggested the
following plan to Lomaśa: the mouse was
to go very close to the cat and while he
was in that condition the cat was to protect
the mouse from the owl and the ichneumon;
when the danger to the mouse from the two
had passed, the mouse was to cut the cords of
the net and free the cat; Lomaśa agreed to
this plan and promised not only to be well-
disposed towards Palita when he drew near, but
also offered later to do, with his friends and
relatives, things pleasing to Palita; the mouse
then moved very close to the cat and slept on
his chest; having seen that the ichneumon and
the owl had returned to their respective homes
Palita started to cut off the cords of the net
slowly; Lomaśa tried to hasten him asking
him not to be ungrateful; Lomaśa wanted
Palita to finish the work before the Caṇḍāla
({%śvapaca%}) returned; Palita refused to hasten
until he was sure that the Caṇḍāla was close
by so that Lomaśa, when freed, would not
pounce on the mouse but jump on the tree
from the fear of the Caṇḍāla; Lomaśa again
pleaded with Palita to be more quick in his
[Page051-a+ 41]
work pointing out that good men did not
act the way Palita was going about his
work; Palita should not remember their
past enmity and delay in freeing the cat;
Palita assured Lomaśa that he had cut off
most of the cords and deliberately left only
one which he would bite off at the proper
time; when the night ended and the Caṇḍāla
was seen arriving, Lomaśa was frightened and
asked Palita what he intended to do; Palita
cut off the last cord and the freed Lomaśa
jumped up the tree as was expected by Palita,
and Palita himself entered his hole; when the
disappointed Caṇḍāla went away, Lomaśa
requested Palita not to misunderstand him if
he, when he became free, jumped up the
tree without conversing with Palita ({%akṛtvā%}
{%saṃvidaṃ kāṃcit sahasāham upaplutaḥ /%}
{%kṛtajñaṃ kṛtakalyāṇaṃ kaccin māṃ nābhi-%}
{%śaṅkase%} 12. 136. 119); Lomaśa asked the
mouse to trust him and come close to him as
he wanted to honour Palita who had saved
him; Lomaśa asked Palita to be his minister
and instruct him like a father ({%amātyo me%}
{%bhava prājña piteva hi praśādhi mām%} 12.
136. 126); the counsel ({%mantra%}) of the mouse
and the strength ({%bala%}) of the cat together
would win victories for them (12. 136. 127);
but Palita pointed out to Lomaśa that he
fell into the trap due to his thoughtlessness
({%capalatvāt%} 12. 136. 142); thoughtlessness
does not help the person himself, how can it
help others ?; Palita plainly told the cat that
he wanted the mouse to move close to him
because he was the food of the cat; Palita
refused to go near Lomaśa when that
was the cat's dinner time; Lomaśa made one
more plea to Palita describing himself to be
the knower of duties ({%dharmajña%}), apprecia-
tive of the merits of others ({%guṇajña%}), grate-
ful for the good act ({%kṛtajña%}), and fond of
[Page051-b+ 38]
friends ({%mitreṣu vatsala%} 12. 136. 179); if the
mouse forsook the cat the latter would die;
Palita, however, remained firm and advised
Lomaśa to protect himself from the Caṇḍāla;
hearing Caṇḍāla's name, the frightened
Lomaśa quickly entered his hole, and Palita
entered his 12. 136. 21-191.
