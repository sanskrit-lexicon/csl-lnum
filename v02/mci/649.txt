<div n="P">When all the sages took the oath to
prove that they had not stolen Agastya's
lotus stalks, Śakra, when his turn came,
uttered a benediction (instead of a curse)
and said, among other things, “Let him
who has stolen your stalks be like a Brāh-
maṇa ({%vipra%}) who takes bath after com-
pleting the study of the Ātharvaṇa Veda”
({%ātharvaṇaṃ vedam adhītya vipraḥ snāyeta%}
{%yaḥ puṣkaram ādadāti%}) 13. 96. 44.
