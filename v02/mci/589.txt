{@Śakti<sup>2</sup>@}¦ f., {@Śaktyastra@} nt.: missile of
Skanda.
<div n="P">Described as terrific ({%bhīmam%} nt.) 9.
45. 60, ({%sughorā%} f.) 9. 45. 62; its association
with Skanda noticed when it is described that
in the entourage of Śiva, Skanda, on his
peacock, stood on the side of Devī,
holding Śakti on his neck ({%śaktim kaṇṭhe%}
{%samādāya%}) 13. 14. 143; it was used by
Skanda against the demon Tāraka and his
associates; Skanda released it again and again,
imbibing it with his own lustre ({%ādadhac%}
{%cātmano tejaḥ%} 9. 45. 60); when released, the
flame of the meteor and resounding thunder-
bolts struck the earth as would happen at the
time of the end of the world; when one
Śakti was hurled by Skanda, crores of Śaktis
fell out from it; Skanda killed with his
missile the demons Tāraka, Mahiṣa, Tripāda
[Page147-b+ 39]
and Hradodara together with innumerable
Daityas; they were burnt by the flames
of the Śaktyastra 9. 45. 60-70. [See
{@Śakti<sup>1</sup>, <sup>3-5</sup>@}]
