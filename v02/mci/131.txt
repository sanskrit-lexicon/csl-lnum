{@Jaritā@}¦ f.: A female {%Śārṅga%} bird
({%śārṅgikā, śārṅgī%} 1. 220. 16; 1. 222. 16).
<div n="P">Lived in the Khāṇḍava forest 1. 220. 19;
sage Mandapāla turned himself into a {%Śārṅga%}
bird and became united with Jaritā; he begot on
her four sons 1. 220. 16-17; when Mandapāla
left his sons, still in the form of eggs, and went
to Lapitā, another {%Śārṅga%} female, Jaritā was
very much worried out of her affection for the
young ones 1. 220. 17-18; she did not aban-
don the eggs and when they were hatched, she
reared them as a bird would do ({%svavṛtyā%})
1. 220. 19; when the Khāṇḍava forest was
on fire she was distressed and lamented for her
sons who had then not developed feathers, or
feet; she did not have strength enough to fly
to a safe place taking all the young ones with
her; she did not know whom to abandon and
whom not; she therefore told her children that
she would cover them under her wings and
die with them 1. 221. 1-7; but the young ones
suggested to her to abandon them and save her-
self from fire 1. 221. 12; she then advised them
to enter the hole of a mouse under a tree which
she would cover with earth; when the fire sub-
sided she would return and remove the earth
1. 221. 15-17; the young ones hesitated for the
fear of the mouse; Jaritā tried to remove the
[Page024-b+ 40]
fear by telling them that the mouse had been
already picked up by a hawk ({%śyena%}); the
young ones were still sceptical; she once again
told them that when the hawk took the mouse
she flew behind the hawk and blessed him to
be golden when he went to heaven for he had
taken off the enemy of the birds 1. 222. 5-8;
the young birds remained firm in their resolve
not to enter the hole and asked their mother to
fly away to a safe place; Jaritā then left her
sons to their fate and flew away 1. 222. 10-
16; when the fire had moved away from that
place Jaritā, coveting her sons, returned and
seeing them safe tears came to her eyes again
and again; she could not believe that they
were safe 1. 224. 17-19; Mandapāla also
remembered Jaritā and his sons and wondered
what might have happened to them in the fire
1. 224. 3-5; Lapitā, the other {%Śārṅgikā,%} en-
vious of Jaritā asked Mandapāla to go to her
for whom he was in anguish 1. 224. 11-13;
Mandapāla met Jaritā and his sons, but the
sons would not talk to him; Jaritā, too,
asked Mandapāla what business he had with
the young birds and told him to return to the
young and sweet smiling Lapitā 1. 224. 21-
25; Mandapāla blamed Jaritā for her distrust
1. 224. 26-31, but also acknowledged her being
conversant with {%dharma (dharmajñatā)%}
1. 225. 2; when all were reconciled Manda-
pāla took his wife ({%bhāryā%}) Jaritā and the
sons with him and left for another country
1. 225. 4.
