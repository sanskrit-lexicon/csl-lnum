of Brahman, the serpent Ananta lifted it for
them 1. 16. 5-7; when gods took it to the
ocean and told it that they wanted to churn the
ocean for {%amṛta,%} the ocean asked for a share
in it as it would bear the pounding by the
Mandara 1. 16. 8-9; gods then requested
Akūpāra, the king of tortoises, to offer
support to the mountain; it agreed and then
Indra fixed the top of the mountain on the
tortoise with some mechanism ({%tasya śailasya%}
{%cāgraṃ vai yantreṇedro 'bhyapīḍayat%}); gods
then started churning the ocean using Man-
dara as the churning rod 1. 16. 10-12; from
the top of the mountain showers of flowers
fell on gods and demons and there arose
a loud noise as the ocean was being churned;
the great mountain crushed many acquatic
creatures and they perished by hundreds; the
mountain destroyed many creatures belonging
to Varuṇa who lived in Pātāla; huge trees, as
they rubbed against each, other, fell down,
together with the birds on them, from the top
of the mountain when the ocean was being
churned; fire which arose due to the rubbing
of the trees engulfed the Mandara mountain;
the fire burnt elephants, lions and other
creatures (on the mountain) 1. 16. 17-23;

5. 9. 52, (5. 10. 6-13); (3) In another
version, Viṣṇu advised gods, Indra and the
rest, to go to Mandara to see Śiva; only
then they would be able to kill their enemy
(Vṛtra); then gods, together with Brahman,
went to Mandara and saw Śiva there 7. 69.
