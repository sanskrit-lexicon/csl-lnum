4. 40. 20); often only these two, and not
all the four, mentioned as yoked to Kṛṣṇa's
chariot, especially if the chariot did not figure

58; 9. 61. 39. {@C.@} Mention on various
occasions: {@1.@} Only the two, yoked to the

Kṛṣṇa's chariot was made ready for his depa-
rture for Dvārakā from Khāṇḍavaprastha

Dvārakā to attack Śālva and his town Saubha
3. 21. 12; (4) when Kṛṣṇa started for Dvā-
rakā after meeting the Pāṇḍavas in the forest
3. 23. 45; (5) when Kṛṣṇa came again to

Sainya, Sugrīva, Meghapuṣpa and Balāhaka,
[Page078-b+ 38]
yoked to the chariot mostly when the chariot
figured in the context of the war: (1) when
the chariot was to be kept ready for Kṛṣṇa's
likely intervention in the war to kill the
Kaurava heroes to enable Arjuna to fulfil
his vow to kill Jayadratha before the sun-
set 7. 56. 35; (2) when the chariot was
brought to Sātyaki when he lost his chariot
while fighting with Karṇa 7. 122. 45; (3)

mission 5. 81. 19; 5. 81. 58-59 (here although
only Sainya and Sugrīva are named all the
four are intended, cf. {%te hayāḥ%}), and on his
return journey 5. 135. 28-30; (5) when
Kṛṣṇa went to meet Bhīṣma 12. 53. 21; 12.
46. 35 (here also although only Sainya and

cf. {%varāśvaiḥ%}).
