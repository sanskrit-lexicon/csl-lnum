{@Nārāyaṇāstra@}¦ nt.: Name of the missile
employed unsuccessfully by Aśvatthāman,
after the death of his father Droṇa, to kill
the Pāṇḍavas 1. 1. 145; 1. 2. 165; 7. 166. 55;
a sub-{%parvan%} related to the employment of
the Nārāyaṇāstra occurs after the sub-{%parvan%}
related to {%droṇavadha%} 1. 2. 58.
{@A.@} History: Droṇa received the Nārā-
yaṇāstra as a boon from Nārāyaṇa himself
who appeared before him in the form of
a Brāhmaṇa 7. 166. 43-44, 51; with its
acquisition Droṇa became unrivalled in
battle 7. 166. 45; given by Nārāyaṇa
also to Aśvatthāman 7. 166. 50; Aśva-
tthāman knew how to release it ({%sakalyam%}
for {%sakalpam ?%} See Cr. Notes 7, p. 1157
on 166. 42; Nī. {%kalyaḥ prayogaḥ%} on Bom.
Ed. 7. 195. 30), and how to withdraw it
({%sanivartanam%}) 7. 166. 42 (but See Section
{@C.@} 3 below); Nārāyaṇāstra known only to
Droṇa and Aśvatthāman; it was not known
even to Arjuna and the other Pāṇḍavas, nor
to Kṛṣṇa, Sātyaki, Dhṛṣṭadyumna and
Śikhaṇḍin 7. 166. 2. 41-42. {@B.@} Descrip-
tion: heavenly ({%divya%}) 1. 1. 145; 7. 166.
60; great missile ({%mahāstra%}) 7. 166. 49;
({%parama%}) 7. 166. 44; fierce, frightful ({%ugra%})
1. 2. 165; ({%ghorarūpaṃ bhayāvaham%}) 7. 167.
6. {@C.@} Use: (1) To be used with great
circumspection: The missile was not to be
employed in haste ({%na tv idaṃ sahasā%}
{%brahman prayoktavyaṃ kathaṃcana%}); since
[Page110-a+ 40]
it did not return without killing the enemy,
it might kill, if used without circumspection,
even one who did not deserve to be killed
7. 166. 46-47; (2) Mode of release: To use
it, Aśvatthāman touched water and produced
the divine missile ({%tathoktvā droṇaputro 'pi%}
{%tadopaspṛśya bhārata / prāduścakāra tad%}
{%divyam astraṃ nārāyaṇaṃ tadā%}) 7. 166. 60;
(3) Restrictions: It could be used only
once, and it could not be withdrawn; hence
Aśvatthāman unable to employ it again when
requested by Duryodhana to do so; if with-
drawn the {%astra%} would kill the user 7. 171.
24, 27, 28, 30. {@D.@} Effects: When em-
ployed, the missile released powerful arrows
({%? kṛśāśvatanayāḥ%}), as also sharp arrows
which would fill the directions 7. 166. 38;
it let loose many heavenly weapons ({%divyāni%}
{%śastravarṣāṇi%}) and the employer (Aśvat-
thāman) shone with lustre 7. 166. 50; the
arrows released from it would hit the enemies
as desired by the employer (Aśvatthāman);
it would release rocks at will and iron-tipped
arrows which would put the enemy to flight
7. 166. 53-54; when Aśvatthāman produced
the missile, thunderous winds carrying water-
drops blew in cloud-less sky, the earth shook,
and the ocean was agitated; rivers started
flowing in the opposite direction; peaks of
mountains were shattered; sun became turbid
({%kaluṣa%}), and the gods, the demons, and
the Gandharvas were frightened 7. 167. 1-5;
arrows with shining tips appeared in thou-
sands to cover the army of the enemy and
fill the directions; (hot) iron balls ({%kārṣṇāya-%}
{%samayā guḍāḥ%}) shining like celestial bodies,
{%śataghnīs%} (‘hundred-killers’), fire-arms
({%? hutāśadāḥ%}), and disks with sharp ends
({%cakrāṇi kṣurāntāni%}), all these were produc-
ed by the Nārāyaṇāstra (7. 170. 16-19); as the
[Page110-b+ 40]
Pāṇḍava warriors tried to resist the missile,
it grew in strength 7. 170. 21; as a result,
the Pāṇḍava army was burnt and destroyed
7. 170. 22-23; to combat it successfully
Kṛṣṇa advised the warriors to lay down arms
and get down from their chariots and mounts
7. 170. 38-42; when all followed his in-
struction, Bhīma wanted to resist the missile
with arrows, mace, and the strength of his
arms; as a consequence, the Nārāyaṇāstra
grew in strength; since other warriors
had laid down their arms the missile des-
cended on Bhīma with all its strength 7.
170. 45-46, 50-51, 57-60; seeing Bhīma
surrounded by the Nārāyaṇāstra, Arjuna tried
to protect him from the missile by using
Vāruṇāstra; since this was of no avail,
Arjuna and Vāsudeva left from their chariot,
ran to Bhīma, and entered through the cover
of lustre produced by the {%astra;%} since they
had no weapons, the {%astra%} did not affect them
(and also because of the effect of the Vāru-
ṇāstra and the prowess of Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna);
Bhīma was forced down by Nara (Arjuna)
and Nārāyaṇa (Kṛṣṇa) from his chariot and
forced to give up weapons; the Nārāyaṇāstra
was then pacified; the quarters became clear
and gentle winds blew; the birds and the
animals felt assured 7. 171. 1, 3, 6, 10-14,
20-22; if Vāsudeva had not shown the way
to combat the Nārāyaṇāstra it would have
meant death for the enemy (of the Kauravas)
7. 171. 28; but the missile was rendered in-
effective and the Pāṇḍavas freed from it 7.
171. 33; 8. 1. 42. {@E.@} The means to pacify
the Nārāyaṇāstra: When released, the missile
must kill the enemy and only then it would
subside; the other ways of pacifying it were to
run away from it, to lay down the arms, to
beg for life, and ask refuge ({%vadhaḥ saṃkhye%}

The Pāśupatāstra of Śiva rated superior to
the Nārāyaṇāstra 13. 14. 127.
