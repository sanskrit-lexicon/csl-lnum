{@A.@} History: In the bygone days, Earth
({%pṛthivī, jagatī, kṣamā%}) asked for her son
Naraka the following boon from the fourth
form of Kṛṣṇa (Viṣṇu) which wakes up once
after thousand years: “May he be equipped
with the Vaiṣṇavāstra so that he cannot be
killed by the gods and the Asuras”; accord-
ingly Viṣṇu gave the missile to Naraka and
said: “May this missile be unfailing in
protecting Naraka; no one shall kill him;
protected by the missile, Naraka will be
unassailable in the worlds for all times”;
from Naraka, the missile went to Prāgjyotiṣa
(Bhagadatta) 7. 28. 26-33. {@B.@} Descrip-
tion: heavenly ({%divya%}) 6. 116. 38; great
missile ({%paramāstra%}) 7. 28. 34; unfailing
({%amogha%}) 7. 28. 29, 30; killer of all
({%sarvaghātaka%}) 7. 28. 17. {@C.@} Know-

according to Bhīṣma, all the heavenly missiles
including the Vaiṣṇava astra, known to
Arjuna and perhaps to Kṛṣṇa, and to no one
else in the world of the mortals ({%sarvasmin%}
{%mānuṣe loke vetty eko hi dhanaṃjayaḥ /%}
{%kṛṣṇo vā devakīputro nānyo vai veda%}
{%kaścana%}) 6. 116. 38-39. {@D.@} Use in
the epic war: Bhagadatta, wishing to
release the Vaiṣṇavāstra ({%udīrayan%}) recited
{%mantras (abhimantrya)%} on his hook
({%aṅkuśa%}) and hurled it aiming it on Arjuna's
chest; Kṛṣṇa covered Arjuna and received the
missile on his chest, where it turned into the
garland Vaijayantī 7. 28. 16-18; since there
was no one in the worlds, including even Indra
and Rudra, who could not be killed by the
missile, Kṛṣṇa covered Arjuna to save him
({%nāsyāvadhyo 'sti lokeṣu sendrarudreṣu%}
{%māriṣa%}) 7. 28. 33-34.
