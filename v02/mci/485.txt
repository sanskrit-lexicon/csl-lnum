dressed in red robes, and wearing red decora-
tions and gold strings; they had formed a cove-
nant ({%kṛtābhisamayāḥ%} 7. 33. 13); they shared
their grief with each other, they were of equal
daring and they vied with each other (in

complished 7. 32. 19 ({%duṣkaraṃ karma%}), a
burden difficult to bear ({%aviṣahyaṃ guruṃ%}
{%bhāram%}) 7. 34. 12; its penetration ({%bheda%})

{%gantum ahaṃ kasyāṃcid āpadi%}) 7. 34.
14-15, 19; 7. 50. 20-21; Abhimanyu commis-
