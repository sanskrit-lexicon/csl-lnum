{@Caitra@}¦ m.: Name of a month.
<div n="P">Aṅgiras had told Bhīṣma (13. 109. 9-
10) that if one, with restrained mind, spent
the month of Caitra eating only once a day
he was born in a noted family that was rich
with gold, gems and pearls 13. 109. 22;
Nārada told the Pāṇḍavas that Brahmadeva
and other gods, the Seers, the Siddhas and the
Cāraṇas visit the famous and very holy con-
fluence of the river Sarasvatī where Janārdana
was worshipped ({%saṅgamaṃ lokaviśrutam /%}
[Page246-a+ 39]
{%sarasvatyā mahāpuṇyam upāsante janār-%}
{%danam //%} 3. 80. 130) on the fourteenth day
of the bright half of Caitra (3. 80. 131);
if a king was threatened by a stronger adver-
sary (12. 69. 32) he should, in the month
of Caitra when there was fear of fire, get in
advance all houses, that were covered with
grass, smeared with mud and remove the
grass from them ({%tṛṇacchannāni veśmāni%}
{%paṅkenāpi pralepayet / nirharec ca tṛṇaṃ%}
{%māse caitre vahnibhayāt puraḥ%}) 12. 69. 45.
