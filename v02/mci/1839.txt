[Page501-a+ 40]
(also called {@Ṛṣabhakūṭa@} 3. 109. 7; once
identified with {@Kailāsa@} 6. 7. 39).
{@A.@} Location: Listed by Saṃjaya among
the six mountains which stretch towards the
east and merge at both ends in the eastern
and the western oceans ({%prāgāyatā mahārāja%}
{%ṣad ete ratnaparvatāḥ / avagāḍhā hy ubha-%}
{%yataḥ samudrau pūrvapaścimau%}) 6. 7. 2;
the distance between them is thousands of
{%yojanas (teṣām antaraviṣkambho yojanāni%}
{%sahasraśaḥ)%} 6. 7. 4; it lies between Haima-
vatavarṣa and Harivarṣa; the Varṣa beyond
Hemakūṭa is Harivarṣa ({%idaṃ tu bhārataṃ%}
{%varṣaṃ tato haimavataṃ param / hemakūṭāt%}
{%paraṃ caiva harivarṣaṃ pracakṣate%}) 6. 7.
6; identified with Kailāsa ({%hemakūṭas tu%}

to the north of Kailāsa and towards Maināka
is the Hiraṇyaśṛṅga mountain 6. 7. 40;
near the rivers Nandā and Aparanandā
({%tataḥ prayātaḥ … nandām aparanandāṃ%}
{%ca nadyau … /sa parvataṃ samāsādya%}
{%hemakūṭam%}) 3. 109. 1-2; 3. 109. 18-19.
{@B.@} Description: Free from disease ({%anā-%}
{%maya%}) 3. 109. 2; big ({%mahāgiri%}) 3. 109. 14;
({%sumahant%}) 6. 7. 39; all the six mountains
listed by Saṃjaya are full of jewels ({%ratna-%}
{%parvatāḥ%}) 6. 7. 2 and resorted to by Siddhas
and Cāraṇas ({%siddhacāraṇasevitāḥ%}) 6. 7. 4.
{@C.@} Characteristics: (1) Many unthinkable
wonders happen on the mountain ({%acintyān%}
{%adbhutān bhāvān dadarśa subahūn nṛpaḥ%});
spoken words turn into clouds and rocks by
thousands and hence people cannot climb it
({%vāco yatrābhavan meghā upalāś ca sahasra-%}
{%śaḥ / nāśaknuvaṃs tam āroḍhum … %}
{%janāḥ //%}) 3. 109. 3; wind always blows there
and it rains continuously; the oblation bearing
god (Fire) can be seen there morning and
evening ({%vāyur nityaṃ vavau yatra nityaṃ%}

{%devaś ca varṣati /sāyaṃ prātaś ca bhaga-%}
{%vān dṛśyate havyavāhanaḥ //%}) 3. 109. 4; (2)
One cannot even look at this mountain, let
alone climb it; one who has not practised
austerities cannot look at it or climb it
({%nāśaknuvann abhidraṣṭuṃ kuta evādhiro-%}
{%hitum // nātaptatapasā śakyo draṣṭum eṣa%}
{%mahāgiriḥ / āroḍhuṃ vāpi kaunteya%}) 3. 109.
13-14; (3) Guhyakas live there ({%hema-%}
{%kūṭe tu guhyakāḥ%}) 6. 7. 48; King Vaiśra-
vaṇa, along with the Guhyakas, enjoys him-
self there ({%yatra vaiśravaṇo rājā guhya-%}
{%kaiḥ saha modate%}) 6. 7. 39. {@D.@} Epic
event: Yudhiṣṭhira having reached Hemakūṭa
saw many wonders there 3. 109. 5; Lomaśa
gave to him the explanation of these
wonders 3. 109. 6-17 (see the next section);
he advised Yudhiṣṭhira to bathe in the
river Nandā flowing along the mountain
since a bath destroyed the sin instantly
3. 109. 18; he also asked him to restrain his
speech ({%niyatavāg bhava%}) 3. 109. 14. {@E.@} Past
events: (1) An ascetic named Ṛṣabha
once lived on this mountain (hence called
Ṛṣabhakūṭa ?) and was practising austerities
for many hundred years ({%anekaśatavarṣāyus%}
{%tapasvī%}); he got angry when he was drawn
into conversation by others; so he told the
mountain to release rocks if any one uttered
a word there; he summoned wind and bade
him not to make noise; hence if any one tried
to speak there he was restrained by a cloud

{%puruṣo meghena vinivāryate //%}) 3. 109.
7-9; (2) When gods formerly came to the
river Nandā (flowing near Hemakūṭa) men
followed there to see the gods; since the
[Page502-a+ 12]
gods, Indra and the rest, did not wish to be
seen by men they made the land inaccessible
making this mountain an obstacle ({%durgaṃ%}
{%cakrur imaṃ deśaṃ giripratyūharūpakam%});
hence men cannot even look at the mountain,
let alone climb it; the gods then always per-
formed best sacrifices there; the signs of
those sacrifices could even now be seen in
the form of the sprawling {%dūrvā%} grass having
the form of sacrificial grass ({%kuśa%}) and many
trees having the shape of sacrificial posts

11-16; (3) Hamakūṭa was one of the
mountains seen by Mārkaṇḍeya in the belly
of the Bāla (3. 186. 83 = Nārāyaṇa 3. 187.
