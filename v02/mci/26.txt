{@Aśvasena@}¦ m.: A mythical serpent.
[Page004-b+ 39]
{@A.@} Family and Residence: Takṣaka's son
and his constant companion ({%nityaṃ saha-%}
{%carāv ubhau%}) 1. 3. 145; 1. 218. 5; 8. 65. 39;
Uttaṅka mentions him, (while praising the
{%nāgas%}), as one living at Kurukṣetra along the
river Ikṣumatī 1. 3. 145. {@B.@} Khāṇḍava
fire: He was at the Khāṇḍava forest at
the time of the great fire, but escaped death
1. 219. 40; his mother swallowed him,
head first, so that when Arjuna cut off her
head while she was flying upwards Aśvasena
did not die 1. 218. 5, 1. 220. 2; Aśvasena
could escape because Indra confounded
Arjuna with {%Vātavarṣa%} (an {%astra ?%}) 1. 218.
9. {@C.@} Part in the great war: Karṇa had a
fiery arrow described as {%bhujaga%} (8. 66. 10),
{%sarpamukha%} (8. 66. 5), poisonous (8. 66. 6,
16); reserved by him for use against Arjuna
8. 66. 5; when the arrow was shot it could
remove only Arjuna's diadem ({%kirīṭa%}) 8. 66.
11, 12, 15, 17; on this arrow apparently lay
the big snake ({%mahoraga%}) Aśvasena, inimical
to Arjuna due to the killing of his mother
by Arjuna 8. 66. 20, 21; Arjuna killed him
when Kṛṣṇa explained to him who the serpent
really was 8. 66. 21, 24; Aśvasena not
directly named in this incident, but Duryo-
dhana names him as figuring in this incident
when he mentions Aśvasena (as an arrow
shot at Arjuna) who was deflected ({%vyaṃ-%}
{%sanenāśvasenasya%}) by Kṛṣṇa 9. 60. 35.
