[Page062-a+ 40]
{%vāsukis tadanantaram%} 1. 31. 5; hence called

excellent serpent’ (i. e. of Vāsuki) 1. 32.
22; listed as a {%kādraveya%} (son of Kadrū,
daughter of Dakṣa) along with Ananta,

63. 10. {@B.@} Epithets and Description: ad-
orable ({%bhagavant%}) 1. 32. 2; lord ({%prabhu%})
1. 32. 5, ({%prabhur bhuvaḥ%}) 1. 32. 22;
to whom {%dharma%} is god ({%dharmadeva%})
1. 32. 23; firm in truth ({%satyadhṛti%}) 1. 32.
6; of infinite coils ({%anantabhoga%}) 1. 32.

{%mottama%}) 1. 32. 21, ({%pannagaśreṣṭha%}) 7. 69.
48; described as ‘high as white mountain, wear-
ing various ornaments, his tongues being like
flames of fire, and of great strength’ ({%śveto-%}
{%ccayanibhākāro nānāvidhavibhūṣaṇaḥ / … %}
{%jvālājihvo mahābalaḥ%}) 5. 101. 3; the big
white snake issuing from the mouth of Bala-
rāma is described as ‘having a thousand heads,
having an expanse like that of a mountain, and
having a red face’ ({%sahasraśīrṣaḥ parvatā-%}
{%bhogavarṣmā / raktānanaḥ%}) where appare-
ntly Śeṣa is meant, but is not directly named
16. 5. 12-13. {@C.@} Śeṣa's austerities and
meeting with Brahmadeva: Śesa deserted
his mother Kadrū and visited the slopes of
the Himālayas; there on the Gandhamādana
mountain and in Badarī, as also at other holy
places like Gokarṇa, Puṣkarāraṇya and in
various {%tīrthas%} and holy abodes ({%āyataneṣu%}
1. 32. 4) Śeṣa practised severe austerities
living on wind and observing difficult vows;
he lived all alone and had controlled his
[Page062-b+ 40]
senses ({%ekāntaśīlī, vijitendriyaḥ%} 1. 32. 4);
during the austerities he put on bark garments
and wore matted hair; his flesh, skin and
sinews dried up; when Pitāmaha Brahman,
saw Śeṣa in this condition he asked him to
do something beneficial to the people instead
of tormenting them by his severe austerities;
he asked Śeṣa the reason for undertaking the
austerities; Śeṣa told Pitāmaha that his
serpent brothers were dull-witted; they envied
each other and did not suffer either Vinatā
or her son (Vainateya Garuḍa) who was
their cousin; they hated Garuḍa; Śeṣa there-
fore did not want to see his brothers nor live
with them; Śeṣa undertook austerities to give
up his body and to avoid the company of his
brothers in the next life; he asked Pitāmaha's
permission to do that 1. 32. 5-12; Brahman
told Śeṣa that his brothers faced danger
because they had offended their mother but
that incident had been taken care of; since
Śeṣa was devoted to righteousness ({%diṣṭyā%}
{%ca buddhir dharme te%} 1. 32. 16), Pitāmaha
offered him a boon 1. 32. 13-16; Śeṣa
desired to find pleasure in righteousness
({%dharma%}), equanimity ({%śama%}), and austerity
({%tapas%}) 1. 32. 17. {@D.@} Śeṣa as supporter
of the earth: Brahman was pleased with Śeṣa's
self-control and equanimity and asked him
to collect the earth properly and hold it so
that it became steady for the benefit of the
creatures; Śeṣa agreed to do what Brahman
desired and asked Brahman to place the
earth on his head; Brahman asked him to go
below the earth for which earth would
provide an opening ({%vivara%}) 1. 32. 21-22;
Śeṣa entered the earth through a cleft and
held the divine ({%devī%}) earth, girdled by the
oceans, after enclosing it on all sides; he made
the earth firm 1. 32. 19-22; 5. 101. 2; 6. 63.
[Page063-a+ 40]
10; 7. 69. 48; for this feat of holding the
earth Śeṣa compared with Brahman or with
Balabhid (Indra) 1. 32. 23; (here called
{%nāga%} Ananta) dwells all alone below the
earth 1. 32. 24; Brahman gave to Śeṣa Vaina-
teya Suparṇa (i. e. Garuḍa) as his friend
1. 32. 25. {@E.@} Association with Viṣṇu
Nārāyaṇa: Nārāyaṇa told Mārkaṇḍeya that
he, having become Śeṣa, supports the earth
surrounded by the four oceans and adorned
by Meru and Mandara 3. 187. 10; when the
entire creation, both moving and non-moving,
gets lost in one single ocean, god Viṣṇu Nārā-
yaṇa sleeps alone on the bed of water on the
huge body of Śeṣa; at that time with Śeṣa's
great coil Viṣṇu encompasses the whole earth
and sustains it 3. 194. 8-10; Hari Nārāyaṇa
when he is in his {%nidrāyoga%} also sleeps on
the bed in the form of the body of the snake
(Śeṣa not named here) which is arranged
on water 12. 335. 57-58, 17. {@F.@} Śeṣa's
place in the four {%vyūhas%} of the Pāñcarātra
system: Nārāyaṇa told Nārada that his
fourth form ({%mūrti%}) created imperishable
({%avyaya%}) Śeṣa who is known as Saṃka-
rṣaṇa; from him was created Pradyumna
12. 326. 68; {%jīva%} is called Śeṣa Saṃkarṣaṇa
12. 326. 35. {@G.@} Other features of his
eminence: (1) A {%jīva,%} before attaining
{%siddhi%} (12. 271. 44) passes through various
courses before he reaches the undecaying and
infinite place of Viṣṇu, Brahman, Śeṣa, and
Nara 12. 271. 50; (2) Droṇa while blessing
Duryodhana says: “May Śeṣa, the eminent
among the serpents, grant well being ({%svasti%})
to you” 7. 69. 48; (3) Baladeva was the
incarnation of a portion of Śeṣa 1. 61. 91;
(4) He with other snakes came to greet
Arjuna's birth 1. 114. 60.
