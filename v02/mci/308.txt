as can be seen from the fact that for holding
consultations in order to find a way out of a
difficult situation he cited the example of
the gods finding out the fire who had dis-
appeared 1. 33. 8; conscious of his merits and
faults ({%guṇadoṣau madāśrayau%} 1. 33. 31).
{@E.@} Eminence: Vāsuki mentioned first when
serpents listed according to their eminence
({%yathāśreṣṭhān%}) 5. 101. 8, 9; gods consecrated

2. {@F.@} Role in churning of the ocean for
nectar: Vāsuki was used as the churning cord
({%netra%} 1. 16. 12; 1. 35. 4) by the gods and
the demons at the time of {%samudramanthana;%}
his one end was held by the great {%asuras,%}
the tail by all the gods; the serpent Ananta
stood near Nārāyaṇa and raised up and
threw down again and again the head of
Vāsuki; from the mouth of Vāsuki, whose
body was forcibly dragged at the time of
churning, smoky winds with fire came out
repeatedly which turned into clouds and lightn-
ings and showered rain on the gods fatigued
due to the labour of churning the ocean 1. 16.
13-16. {@G.@} Vāsuki and the snake sacrifice
of Janamejaya: When Vāsuki heard the curse
of Kadrū, the mother of serpents, that they
would be burnt in the snake sacrifice of
Janamejaya (1. 13. 35), he held consultations
with his brother Airāvata and other serpents
to think of the remedy to nullify the curse
({%śāpo 'yaṃ na bhavet katham%} 1. 33. 1); he
told them that all curses had a cure, but the
curse of a mother would be difficult to avert,
especially when the curse was uttered within
the hearing of the imperishable god (i. e.
Brahman) (cf. 1. 18. 9) and the god did not
stop her from uttering the terrible curse; yet
they had to find a way out before it was too
late; they had to see if the snake sacrifice of
Janamejaya did not get started or, if started,
it could be defeated in its purpose ({%yathā sa%}
{%yajño na bhaved yathā vāpi parābhavet%} 1.
33. 9) 1. 33. 1-9; he listened to the sugges-
tions made by serpents to avoid the snake
sacrifice but did not agree with any one of
them; he himself had nothing better to offer,
hence he was worried 1. 33. 29-31; at that time
Elāpatra informed Vāsuki that since Pitāmaha
Brahman had prophesied that the son of the
[Page055-b+ 41]
great sage Jaratkāru born of his wife having
the same name would stop the snake sacrifice
and free virtuous serpents from danger,
Vāsuki should give in marriage his sister,
who was named Jaratkāru, to the sage, when
he came begging for a maiden; that would
put an end to the fear of the serpents 1. 34.
1-18; earlier, after the churning of the ocean,
the gods had taken Vāsuki to Pitāmaha
Brahman and told him that Vāsuki was very
much disturbed due to the curse of his mother
and that Pitāmaha should free him from his
mental agony; they pointed out that Vāsuki
had always acted for the benefit of the gods
and for what was dear to them; Pitāmaha
had then told the gods that when the occasion
arrived Vāsuki should act according to the
advice of Elāpatra 1. 35. 5-7; 1. 48. 25;
1. 49. 9-13, 25; thereafter Vāsuki took great
care of his sister Jaratkāru knowing her to be
the saviour of serpents 1. 35. 2; Vāsuki appoi-
nted various serpents to watch for Jaratkāru
and report to him when Jaratkāru arrived
asking for a wife 1. 35. 12-13; when Jarat-
kāru arrived Vāsuki's attendants informed him
about Jaratkāru's intention to marry a girl
of his name and who was offered as alms;
knowing this Vāsuki approached the sage
Jaratkāru with his well-adorned sister; the
sage asked Vāsuki his sister's name and also
told him that even after marriage it would be
Vāsuki's responsibility to maintain her 1. 42.
16-20; Vāsuki assured Jaratkāru that his
sister had the same name as the sage and
that he would support her even after marriage
with all his might 1. 42. 16-20; 1. 43. 1-2;
1. 13. 30-34; Jaratkāru then went to Vāsuki's
residence and married his sister; Jaratkāru
went with his wife to the shining house
({%vāsagṛhaṃ śubhram%} 1. 43. 5) approved by
Vāsuki 1. 43. 3-5; when the sage Jaratkāru
[Page056-a+ 41]
left his wife he asked her to inform Vāsuki
about his departure and that he had lived
happily with him 1. 43. 29; Jaratkāru's wife
pleaded with the sage that he should not
abandon her; he should realize what Vāsuki
would feel if he knew that her husband had
left her without blessing her with a son—
that being the principal purpose of their
marriage—1. 43. 32-34; when Vāsuki knew
about Jaratkāru's departure he was sorry;
but he would not pursue the sage fearing that
he might curse him; he knew it was improper
to ask his sister if she was with a child from
Jaratkāru but the seriousness of the matter
prompted him to do that ({%kiṃ hi kārya-%}
{%garīyastvāt tatas tvāham acūcudam%} 1. 44.
6); Vāsuki's sister assured him that she had
conceived from Jaratkāru and that a lustrous
son will be born to her; she removed his
anxiety; on hearing the news Vāsuki was
happy; he honoured his sister by giving gifts 1.
44. 1-15; later when the snake sacrifice began
Vāsuki was highly disturbed due to the death
of a large number of serpents and feared that
he himself might fall into the fire; he there-
fore told his sister Jaratkāru that the time
had came for her son Āstīka to intervene and
stop the destruction of the snakes 1. 48. 19-
26; accordingly Jaratkāru asked her son to ful-
fil the purpose for which she was married to
Jaratkāru; on enquiry, Jaratkāru told Āstīka
why Vāsuki gave her to the sage Jaratkāru 1.
49. 1-15; Āstīka assured Vāsuki, who was
terribly upset, that he would release him from
the curse and remove his fear 1. 49. 17-21;
when Vāsuki again expressed his anxiety by
saying that he felt he was revolving, that
his heart was bursting, and that he had lost
sense of directions as he was afflicted by
the punishment inflicted by Brahman ({%āstīka%}
{%parighūrṇāmi hṛdayaṃ me vidīryate / diśaś%}
[Page056-b+ 40]
{%ca na prajānāmi brahmadaṇḍanipīḍitaḥ%} 1.
49. 22), Āstika reassured him that he would
destroy Vāsuki's fear of {%brahmadaṇḍa%} 1. 49.
22-24; later after accomplishing his difficult
task Āstīka returned to his mother and
maternal uncle (Vāsuki) and reported to
them all that had happened at Janamejaya's
snake sacrifice; all the serpents present
were happy to receive the news 1. 53. 17-18.

one of the {%nāgas%} who wait upon Varuṇa in
his {%sabhā%} without feeling fatigue 2. 9. 8, 11;
(2) present among those who arrived to greet
the birth of Arjuna 1. 114. 60; (3) he sided

the mid-region to watch the battle took sides

was one of the snakes who received the white
serpent issuing from Balarāma's mouth and
entering the ocean 16. 5. 14, 12; (5) after
Skanda's consecration as the leader of the
army (9. 43. 48) and when gifts were given
to Skanda, Vāsuki gave him two snakes,
Jaya and Mahājaya 9. 44. 48; (6) when
Uttaṅka blew into the anus of the horse
(god Fire), the house of Vāsuki and other
prominent snakes in the {%nāgaloka%} were cover-
ed with smoke 14. 57. 46-47.
