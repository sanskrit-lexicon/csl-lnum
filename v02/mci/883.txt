{@A.@} Duration: It lasts for six months
({%ṣaṇmāsā dakṣiṇāyanam%}) 6. 30. 25. {@B.@}
Association with darkness: Vyāsa told Śuka
that Dakṣiṇāyaṇa formed the night of the
gods ({%rātriḥ syād dakṣiṇāyanam%}) 12. 224.
[Page251-a+ 40]
16; Dakṣiṇāyana is associated with blind
darkness and the dark night ({%andhaṃ tamas%}
{%tamisraṃ ca dakṣiṇāyanam eva ca%}) 13.
101. 46. {@C.@} Bhīṣma's falling down in the
Dakṣiṇāyana and his death in the Uttarā-
yaṇa: When Bhīṣma fell down on the battle-
field he heard a heavenly voice in the mid-
region resounding all around saying “how
should the high-souled Gāṅgeya (Bhīṣma)
die when it was Dakṣiṇāyana ?” ({%kathaṃ%}
{%mahātmā gāṅgeyaḥ … /kālaṃ kartā nara-%}
{%vyāghraḥ saṃprāpte dakṣiṇāyane%}) 6. 114.
88; the great sages who, in the form of the
swans, were sent by Gaṅgā observed that the
sun was in the south when Bhīṣma fell from
the chariot ({%dakṣiṇena ca bhāskaram%} 6. 114.
93); they said to each other: (it seems)
Bhīṣma, though high-souled, shall die when
it was Dakṣiṇāyaṇa ({%itaretaram āmantrya%}
{%prāhus tatra manīṣiṇaḥ / bhīṣma eva mahā-%}
{%tmā san saṃsthātā dakṣiṇāyane //%}) 6. 114.
94 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 119. 102: {%saṃ-%}
{%sthātā mariṣyati%}); Bhīṣma then assured the
sages that he had resolved that in no case
would he go (from this world) when the
sun was turned towards the south ({%tān%}
{%abravīc chāntanavo nāhaṃ gantā kathaṃ-%}
{%cana / dakṣiṇāvṛtta āditye etan me manasi%}
{%sthitam //%}) 6. 114. 96; Yudhiṣṭhira became
anxious when the realized that Bhīṣma had only
a few days to live in the Dakṣiṇāyana and
that he would soon leave for the highest state
when the sun had started moving (north-
wards) ({%śeṣam alpaṃ dmānāṃ te dakṣiṇā-%}
{%yanabhāskare / āvṛtte bhagavaty arke gant-%}
{%āsi paramāṃ gatim //%}) 12. 291. 4; the period
of Dakṣiṇāyaṇa, when Bhīṣma fell, is alluded
to in Bhīṣma's instruction to Yudhiṣṭhira to
come back to him when the sun had return-
ed (from the southerly course) ({%vinivṛtte%}
[Page251-b+ 40]
{%dinakare%}) 13. 152. 10; it is also alluded to
when Yudhiṣṭhira returned to meet Bhīṣma
({%dṛṣṭvā nivṛttam ādityam pravṛttaṃ cottarā-%}
{%yaṇam%}) 13. 153. 6; when Bhīṣma, on seeing
Yudhiṣṭhira, greeted him and said that the sun
had, indeed, returned (from the southerly
course) ({%parivṛtto hi bhagavān sahasrāṃśur%}
{%divākaraḥ%}) 13. 153. 26; and when Bhīṣma,
composed in attitude, put his entire bodily
function in his self as soon as the sun had
returned (from the south) ({%nivṛttamātre tv%}
{%ayane uttare vai divākare / samāveśayad%}
{%ātmānam ātmany eva samāhitaḥ //%}) 12. 47.
3; Bhīṣma finally died when the sun left the
southerly course and the Uttarāyaṇa had start-
ed ({%akarot sa tataḥ kālaṃ śaratalpagato%}
{%muniḥ // ayanaṃ dakṣiṇaṃ hitvā saṃprāpte%}
{%cottarāyaṇe //%}) 14. 59. 12. {@D.@} Death in
the Dakṣiṇāyana: If a Yogī dies during the six
months of the Dakṣiṇāyana he, after reaching
the moon's realm of light, returns to this
world ({%ṣaṇmāsā dakṣiṇāyanam / tatra cān-%}
{%dramasaṃ jyotir yogī prāpya nivartate //%})
6. 30. 25; Nārada, while consoling Sṛñjaya
lamenting over the death of his son, told
him that Ambarīṣa, son of Nābhāga, and
hundreds of other kings who performed the
Aśvamedha, went towards the Dakṣiṇāyana
(i. e. died during the Dakṣiṇāyana) ({%sarve%}
{%'śvamedhair ījānās te 'bhyayur dakṣiṇāya-%}
{%nam%}) 12. 29. 96; (Nī., however, who reads
{%anvayuḥ,%} on Bom. Ed. 12. 29. 103: {%sarve%}
{%rājānaḥ … dakṣiṇāyanam anu paścāt ayur%}
{%gatāḥ / uttarāyaṇamārgeṇa hiraṇyagarbha-%}
{%lokaṃ prāptāḥ ity arthaḥ%}); but men who
perform bad deeds and who die in the
Dakṣiṇāyana wait upon Dharmarāja (Yama)
in his {%sabhā (narā duṣkṛtakarmāṇo dakṣi-%}

2. 8. 28-29. [For most of the information
