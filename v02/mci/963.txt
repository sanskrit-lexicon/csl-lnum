{@Soma@}¦ m.: Name of the planet moon,
referred to also as {@Candra@} or {@Candramas@}
and by its other synonyms such as {@Indu,@}
{@Śaśin, Niśākara.@}
{@A.@} Origin and activity: According to
Bhīṣma, Candra, Āditya and other planets,
the constellations and stars were born from
Viṣvaksena (i. e. Kṛṣṇa) ({%candrādityau%}
{%grahanakṣatratārāḥ … viṣvaksenāt sarvam%}
{%etat prasūtam%}) 13. 143. 31; Puruṣottama
(Nārāyaṇa) told the seven sages, Marīci
and others, that the sun, the moon, all con-
stellations act in their own prescribed way in
their respective spheres and are considered an
authority ({%sūryācandramasau … adnikāreṣu%}
{%vartante yathāsvaṃ … sarve pramāṇaṃ hi%})
12. 322. 39-40. {@B.@} Born repeatedly,
its waxing and waning: The moon is born
repeatedly ({%candramā jāyate punaḥ%}) 3. 297.
47; vanishes thousands of times ({%candramā%}
{%iva … sahasraśaḥ / līyate%}) 12. 293. 3; the
moon waxes and wanes ({%kṣayaṃ vṛddhiṃ ca%}
{%candrasya%}) 12. 290. 46; the moon on the
new moon day remains only as a very thin
digit ({%viddhi candramasaṃ darśe sūkṣmayā%}
{%kalayā sthitam%}) 12. 233. 15; the fifteen
[Page278-a+ 40]
digits of the moon are its source and abode;
the moon also has a sixteenth digit, which
is very thin, and that is the real moon; that
digit is not used by gods but it favours
gods (?) ({%kalāḥ pañcadaśā yonis tad%}

{%devair indriyair na upayujyate pālyate kiṃ-%}
{%tu devān eva sattāsphūrtipradānena upa-%}
{%yunakti pālayati%}). {@C.@} Description: high-
souled ({%mahātman%}) 6. 13. 42; whose rays
are cool ({%śītaraśmi%}) 6. 13. 42; {@D.@} Ex-
tent: Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya to tell
him everything about the extent ({%sarvaṃ%}
{%pramāṇam%}) of Soma, to which Saṃjaya
agreed 6. 12. 3-4; according to Saṃjaya's
information the diameter ({%viṣkambha%}) of
Candramas was 11000 {%yojanas%} and its cir-
cumference ({%maṇḍalam%}) 33000 {%yojanas;%}
(according to the learned Paurāṇikas) the
expanse ({%vaipulya%}) of the moon was 5900
{%yojanas (candramās tu sahasrāṇi rājann%}
{%ekādaśa smṛtaḥ / viṣkambheṇa kuruśreṣṭha%}
{%trayastriṃśat tu maṇḍalam // ekonaśaṣṭir%}
{%vaipulyāc chītaraśmer mahātmanaḥ)%} 6. 13.
42 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 12. 41 interprets
{%vipulatvena%} as {%tato 'py ādhikyena;%} in that
case moon's circumference will be 33000 +
5900 = 38900; see also the editor's note on
the stanza 6. 13. 41, Vol. 7, p. 765); on
account of the larger extent of Rāhu, it covers
the sun and the moon at proper times ({%sa%}

Śiva, said that he (Śiva) was Candramas
among the {%nakṣatras (nakṣatrāṇāṃ ca%}
[Page278-b+ 40]
{%candramāḥ)%} 13. 14. 156; Soma appears
among the names of Śiva ({%somo nakṣatra-%}
{%sādhakaḥ%}) 13. 17. 36; also Candra in a com-
plex form ({%candrasūryagatiḥ%}) 13. 17. 37;
(2) Soma appears as one of the names of
Sūrya taught by Dhaumya to Yudhiṣṭhira 3.

kara) the chief of the constellations ({%cakre%}
{%nakṣatrāṇāṃ niśākaram (īśam)%}) 12. 122.
31; Candramas is known as the chief of the
constellations ({%nakṣatrāṇāṃ ca candramāḥ%}
{%(adhipaḥ)%}) 14. 43. 6; Indu is known as
the chief of the luminous bodies ({%jyotiṣām%}

Kṛta Yuga: When the Moon, the Sun, the
Tiṣya (Puṣya) and Bṛhaspati will come in
one {%rāśi,%} the Kṛta age will commence 3.
188. 87 (for the citation and Nī.'s com,
[Page279-a+ 40]
on it see {@Puṣya<sup>1</sup>,@} p. 257. 1). {@G.@} Mytho-
logical events: (1) Pained due to the des-
truction indulged in by Sunda and Upasunda,
the moon, the sun, the planets, the stars, the
constellations and the denizens of the heaven
felt dejected ({%candrādityau grahās tārā%}
{%nakṣatrāṇi divaukasaḥ / jagmur viṣādam%})
1. 202. 26; (2) When the gods made
ready an excellent chariot for Śiva's fight
with the Tripuras, Sūrya and Candramas
were made its wheels ({%sūryācandramasau%}
{%kṛtvā cakre rathavarottame%}) 8. 24. 71.
{@H.@} Auspicious conjunction: (1) Kuntī
gave birth to Yudhiṣṭhira when the moon
was in conjunction with the Aindra (Jyeṣṭhā)
{%nakṣatra (aindre candrasamāyukte)%} 1.
114. 4-5; (2) Vyāsa asked first Yudhi-
ṣṭhira to take the hand of Draupadī (in
marriage) since that was an auspicious
day on which Candramas would he in con-
junction with the Puṣya constellation (for
the citation and Nī.'s comment on it see
above {@Pauṣya@} p. 259. 1); (3) Daśaratha
asked his Purohita to make preparations for
the consecration of Rāma as heir-apparent
since on that night the moon would be
in conjunction with the Puṣya which was an
auspicious {%yoga (adhya puṣyo niśi brahman%}
{%puṇyaṃ yogam upaiṣyati)%} 3. 261. 15;
{@I.@} Omens: (1) While pointing out different
bad omens to Kṛṣṇa, Karṇa said that the
mark on Soma had disappeared ({%somasya%}
{%lakṣma vyāvṛttam%}) 5. 141. 10 (But Nī. on
Bom. Ed. 5. 143. 11: {%lakṣma vyāvṛttaṃ%}
{%kṣīṇatvād amāvāsyāsānnidhyāt kṣīṇacandro%}
{%'pi pāpa eva%}); the same bad omen was
noticed by Vyāsa also which, according to him,
indicated great danger ({%vyāvṛttaṃ lakṣma%}
{%somasya bhaviṣyati mahad bhayam%}) 6. 2.
32 (Here Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 2. 32: {%vyā-%}
[Page279-b+ 40]
{%vṛttaṃ naṣṭaṃ lakṣmahīnaś candra dṛśyata%}
{%ity arthaḥ%}); a similar sight was noticeable
at the junction of the Tretā and the Dvāpara
when there occurred a drought for twelve
years; at that time Soma, with its mark
disappeared, receded to the south ({%jagāma%}
{%dakṣiṇaṃ māragaṃ somo vyāvṛttalakṣaṇaḥ%})
12. 139. 15 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 141. 15:
{%vyāvṛttaṃ anyathābhūtaṃ lakṣaṇaṃ cihnaṃ%}
{%yasya%}); (2) According to another omen
noticed by Vyāsa and reported to Dhṛtarāṣṭra
the moon on the Kārttikī full moon night,
being without lustre, was (sometimes ?) not
visible, and (at other times ?) with the
colour of fire appeared in the sky which had
the same colour ({%alakṣyaḥ prabhayā hīnaḥ%}
{%paurṇamāsīṃ ca kārttikīm / candro 'bhūd%}
{%agnivarṇaś ca samavarṇe nabhastale%}) 6.
2. 23; (3) According to a third omen
noticed by Vyāsa, whether it was day or
night, the sun, the moon and the constellations
appeared blazing; that indicated destruction
({%jvalitārkendunakṣatraṃ nirviśeṣadinakṣa-%}
{%pam / ahorātraṃ mayā dṛṣṭaṃ tat kṣayāya%}
{%bhaviṣyati //%}) 6. 2. 22; (4) According to
another astronomical event, Vyāsa noticed
that the {%amāvāsyā%} had occurred on the
thirteenth day of the month which was very
unusual; on that day Candra and Sūrya
both were swallowed the same month by
Rāhu at an improper time 6. 2. 28-29 (for
citation and Nī.'s commentary see Sūrya
p. 276. 2); (5) A similar event-Rāhu
swallowed Āditya and at the same time
Soma-occurred when the Sindhu heroes
fought with Arjuna ({%rāhur agrasad ādityaṃ%}
{%yugapat somam eva ca%}) 14. 76. 15; (6)
Saṃjaya told Dhṛtarāṣṭra that the day on
which the two armies gathered at Kurukṣetra,
Soma was in the constellation Maghā and the
[Page280-a+ 40]
seven principal planets gathered in the sky
blazing (for the citation and Nī.'s commen-
tary on it see above {@Maghā,@} p. 263. 1);
(7) Yājñavalkya told Janataka that one to
whom the full moon appeared broken towards
the south had only a year to live ({%purṇen-%}
{%duṃ (dīpam eva ca) / khaṇḍābhāsaṃ dakṣi-%}
{%ṇatas te 'pi saṃvatsarāyuṣaḥ //%}) 12. 305. 9;
(8) He also told Janaka that one who saw
Soma with a hole like a wheel with a broken
nave had only a week to live ({%śīrṇanābhi%}
{%yathā cakraṃ chidraṃ somaṃ prapaśyati /%}
{%saptarātreṇa mṛtyubhāk%}) 12. 305. 13.
{@J.@} Similes: (1) Rohiṇī's association with
the moon: Sudeva wondered when would
Damayantī be associated with Nala, as
Rohiṇī with Śaśin, and end her miseries
({%rohiṇī śaśino yathā%}) 3. 65. 21; Śāntā
waited on Ṛśyaśrṅga as Rohiṇī on Soma
({%khe rohiṇī somam ivāmukūlā%}) 3. 113. 22;
Kuntī blessed Draupadi after her marriage
saying that she might be united with her
husbands as Rohiṇī with Soma ({%rohiṇī ca%}
{%yathā some%}) 1. 191. 5; also cf. {%candraś ca%}
{%rohiṇyām%} 5. 115. 9; {%rohiṇī śaśinaḥ%} 13. 134.

{%nakṣatras:%} (i) Kṛttikās: The king of the
Prāgjyotiṣa with a white parasol decorated
with garlands ({%mālayadāmavatā … śvetaccha-%}

day in conjunction with the Kṛttikās ({%kṛ-%}
{%ttikāyogayuktena paurṇamāsyām ivendunā%})
7. 19. 18; (ii) Sāvitra: Droṇa in the
company of the five Pāṇḍava brothers looked
like the moon in association with the constel-
lation Sāvitra (i. e. Hasta) consisting of
five stars ({%pañcatāreṇa saṃyuktaḥ sāvitre-%}
{%ṇeva candramāḥ%}) 1. 125. 30 (Nī. on Bom.
Ed. 1. 135. 30: {%sāvitreṇa hastanakṣatreṇa%});
(iii) Punarvasū: the two Pāñcāla heroes
[Page280-b+ 40]
({%pāñcālyau%}), guarding the wheels of Yudhi-
ṣṭhira, shone like the two Punaravasu stars
on the two sides of the moon ({%rathābhyāśe%}
{%cakāśete candrasyeva punarvasū%}) 8. 33. 16;
(iv) Viśākhā: Karṇa with the two shin-
ing {%kuṇḍalas%} in his ears appeared like the
bright moon in the sky with two Viśākhā
stars on each side ({%viśākhayor madhya-%}
{%gataḥ śaśīva vimalo divi%}) 3. 285. 11; the
head of the Pāṇḍya king wearing the
{%kuṇḍalas%} shone like the moon with two
Viśākhā stars on two sides 8. 15. 42; also
8. 14. 50; (v) Constellations or stars in
general: Balarāma of white complexion and
wearing a blue garment ({%nīlavāsāḥ sita-%}
{%prabhaḥ%}), seated among the kings, appeared
like the moon among the constellations
({%nakṣatragaṇaiḥ parikīrṇo niśākaraḥ%}) 9.
33. 17; 9. 54. 42; Kṛṣṇa told Karṇa that he,
among the Pāṇḍavas, would appear like the
moon among the {%nakṣatras%} 5. 138. 27; the
sons of Draupadī, with their followers, stood
round Dhṛṣṭadyumna like the multitude of
stars around the moon ({%candraṃ tārāgaṇā%}
{%iva%}) 8. 32. 6; when king Sagara, followed
by his 60000 sons, moved he looked liked
the king of the {%nakṣatras%} (i. e. the moon)
followed by luminous bodies in a cloudless
sky at the end of the rainy season ({%nakṣa-%}
{%trarājaṃ varṣānte vyabhre jyotirgaṇā iva%})
12. 29. 123; (3) Moon's association with
planets: (i) Aṅgāraka: Droṇa entered the
arena with Aśvatthāhman as the moon enters
a cloudless sky in the company of Aṅgāraka
({%nabho jaladharair hīnaṃ sāṅgāraka ivāṃ-%}

(iv) Planets in general: Lakṣmaṇa and
Rāma surrounded by the monkey chiefs look-
ed like the moon and the sun surrounded by
the planets ({%candrasūryau grahair iva%}) 3.
267. 17; the seven Kaurava brothers tormented
Bhīmasena (by showering arrows) as do the
seven planets the moon at the time of the
destruction of the creatures ({%prajāsaṃha-%}
{%raṇe rājan somaṃ sapta grahā iva%}) 7. 112.
22; the five sons of Draupadī tormented
Ārśyaśṛṅgī as do the five planets the moon at
the end of the Yuga ({%yathā yugakṣaye%}
{%ghore candramāḥ pañcabhir grahaiḥ%}) 6.
96. 36; (4) Moon by itself (i) Kaca,
coming out of the belly of his teacher, is
compared with the moon on the full moon
day on the last day of the bright fortnight
({%śūklātyaye paurṇamāsyām ivenduḥ%}) 1.
71. 49; (ii) The fierce fight of Droṇa and
