land was covered with Kurava trees
({%kuravoraśchadaṃ … māgadhaṃ kṣetram%})
2. 18. 29; it could not be avoided by
clouds due to the presence of the serpent
Maṇi ({%aparihāryā meghānāṃ māgadheyaṃ%}
{%maṇeḥ kṛte%}) 2. 19. 10; the Magadha
warriors were brave ({%śūra%}) 7. 82. 35, ener-
[Page832-b+ 40]
getic ({%tarasvin%}) 8. 31. 11, and performers
of exploits ({%parākrānta%}) 5. 52. 2; skilled
in fighting while riding elephants ({%gaja-%}
{%yodhin, gajayuddheṣu kuśalāḥ%}) 8. 17. 2-3;
their women were long-eyed ({%āyatanetra%})
and had sweet voice ({%susvara%}) 11. 25. 8:
{@C.@} Characteristic of the people: Karṇa
told Śalya that Magadhas knew what the
eternal {%dharma%} was ({%magadhās tathā // … %}
{%dharmaṃ jānanti śāśvatam%}) 8. 30. 60-61;
Māgadha elders followed the prescribed
{%dharmas (māgadhāś ca śiṣṭān dharmān%}
{%upajīvanti vṛddhāḥ)%} 8. 30. 75; Magadhas
understood the intentions of others
(even if they were not expressed in
so many words) ({%iṅgitajñāś ca maga-%}
{%dhāḥ%}) 8. 30. 79. {@D.@} Epic events: (1)
Bhīṣma defeated all Māgadha warriors
when he forcibly carried away two prin-
cesses for Vicitravīrya 13. 44. 37; (2)
Pāṇḍu in his conquest of the earth killed
Dārva, the protector of Magadharāṣṭra, at
Rājagṛha ({%goptā magadharāṣṭrasya%}) 1. 105.
10; (3) At the birth of Jarāsandha, his
father Bṛhadratha ordered a festival for the
Magadha people in honour of the Rākṣasī
Jarā ({%ājñāpayac ca … māgadheṣu mahotsa-%}
{%vam%}) 2. 17. 5; (4) Once the sage Caṇḍa-
kauśika happened to visit the Magadha
country ({%magadhān upacakrāma%}) 2. 17. 8;
(5) Kṛṣṇa, along with Bhīma and Arjuna,
left Khāṇḍavaprastha for the Magadha
country ({%pratasthur māgadhaṃ prati%});
proceeding towards the east, they reached
the Magadha land after crossing the rivers
Gaṅgā and Śoṇa; when they reached the
Goratha mountain they saw the capital
town of Magadha ({%uttīrya gaṅgāṃ śoṇaṃ%}

{%āsādya dadṛśur māgadhaṃ puram //%}) 2. 18.
21, 29-30; they proceeded towards the
capital town of the Magadha country ({%māga-%}
{%dhaṃ puram%}) and attacked the very beautiful
surroundings of the {%caityaka%} of Māgadhas
({%māgadhānāṃ suruciraṃ caityakāntam%}
{%upādravan%}) 2. 19. 12, 17 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 2.
21. 15: {%caityakaṃ nagarasūcakam%}); when
they had entered the town, the Magadha
people, seeing them, were wonderstruck
2. 19. 19, 27; Kṛṣṇa advised Jarāsandha
not to disregard others because he had
the support of the large and strong army
of Māgadhas ({%māgadhair vipulaiḥ sainyair%}
{%bāhulyabaladarpitaiḥ%}) 2. 20. 18; hearing
the loud roar of Bhīma and Jarāsandha
the people of Magadha were much afraid,
their pregnant women lost their foetus
({%strīṇāṃ garbhāś ca susruvuḥ%}); they
wondered whether the Himālaya had
broken down or whether the earth was
being torn apart ({%kiṃ nu svid dhimavān%}
{%bhinnaḥ kiṃ nu svid dīryate mahī / iti sma%}
{%māgadhā jajñur … %}) 2. 22. 8-9; when the
Magadha people saw Kṛṣṇa, Bhīma and
Arjuna riding the chariot of Jarāsandha,
they were astounded 2. 22. 19; (6) Bhīma
in his expedition before the Rājasūya went
towards the east ({%yayau prācīṃ diśaṃ%}
{%prati%} 2. 27. 1; 2. 23. 9); he defeated Suhmas
and Prācyasuhmas and then marched on
Magadha; there he pacified the son of
Jarāsandha and collected tribute from him
({%tataḥ suhmān prācyasuhmān … vijitya … %}

{%yitvā kare ca viniveśya ha%}) 2. 27. 14, 16;
Later, Sahadeva (not Bhīma) is said to
have defeated Magadhas in battle ({%yaḥ%}
{%kāśīn aṅgamagadhān … yudhājayat / tena%}
{% … sahadevena%}) 5. 49. 28; (7) On the
second day of war, Droṇa, along with
[Page833-b+ 41]
Māgadhas and others, followed Bhīṣma
in the Mahāvyūha of Kauravas 6. 47. 12,
10: (8) On the third day, Māgadhas,
equipped for battle, stood at the right
wing of the Garuḍavyūha of Kauravas
({%māgadhāś ca … dakṣiṇaṃ pakṣam āsādya%}
{%sthitā vyūhasya daṃśitāḥ%}) 6. 52. 8, 3; (9)
On the fourth day, the Magadha army of
ten thousand energetic elephants led by
Jayatsena (not named) attacked Bhīma
({%anīkaṃ daśasāhasraṃ kuñjarāṇāṃ tara-%}
{%svināṃ / māgadhaṃ purataḥ kṛtvā bhīma-%}
{%senaṃ samabhyayāt //%}) 6. 58. 31; (10)
On the eighth day, Bhagadatta, along
with Māgadha warriors and others follow-
ed Droṇa in the Mahāvyūha of Kauravas
6. 83. 8; (11) On the twelfth day,
Māgadhas and others were stationed at the
back ({%pṛṣṭhe%}) of the Suparṇavyūha of the
Kauravas 7. 19. 11, 4-5; (12) On the
fourteenth day, when Vyāghradatta was
killed by Sātyaki, Māgadhas rushed towards
Sātyaki and showered him with arrows and
{%tomaras%} by thousands and also with
{%bhiṇḍipāla, prāsa%} and {%mudgara;%} but Sātyaki
easily defeated them all and they fled 7. 82.
33-36; (13) After the death of Droṇa,
Dhṛtarāṣṭra, lamenting, recalled Kṛṣṇa's
exploits which included his victory over
Māgadhas 7. 10. 15; (14) On the sixteenth
day, Māgadhas (on Pāṇḍavas' side) attack-
ed the Kaurava army ({%māgadhāś cāpi%}
{%dudruvuḥ%}) 8. 8. 19; (15) The same day,
Māgadhas and others on the side of Kaura-
vas, skilled in fighting while riding ele-
phants, were driven by the elephant-riders
towards Dhṛṣṭadyumna; they showered
him with arrows, {%tomaras%} and {%nārācas;%}
Dhṛṣṭadyumna pierced the elephants of
the enemies with arrows-each one with
ten, six or eight arrows; Dhṛṣṭadyumna
[Page834-a+ 40]
and Pāṇḍava heroes succeeded in routing
the attack of elephants ({%hastibhis tu%}

{%hatvā tava gajān // %}) 8. 17. 28; (16) On
the seventeenth day, Kṛpa, along with the
energetic Māgadha warriors, stood on the
right side of the Bārhaspatyavyūha (8. 31.
26) of the Kauravas ({%kṛpaḥ śāradvato%}

edn. adopts the reading {%māgadhaḥ%} (sg.);
but it is almost certain that we have to
read {%māgadhāḥ%} (pl.); the plural {%tarasvinaḥ%}
is hardly meant to include Kṛpa, Kṛtavar-
man and some Māgadha prince (sg.); he
cannot be Jayatsena since he was already
killed by Abhimanyu; adjective like
{%tarasvinaḥ%} are used with reference to
general warriors; there are variant read-
ings to support {%māgadhāḥ;%} the editor has
no note on the stanza); the same day,
Bhīma killed many Māgadhas (siding
with Kauravas) 8. 49. 79; (17) On the
eighteenth day, to praise Bhīma before his
duel with Duryodhana, Kṛṣṇa reminded
him that he had formerly killed many
Māgadhas along with other warriors 9.
32. 32; (18) After the war Gāndhārī
pointed out to Kṛṣṇa Māgadhī women,
who in grief had discarded their gold
ornaments, surrounding the dead body
of Jayatsena and weeping; they rolled on
the ground; their wailing sound deluded
the mind of Gāndhārī ({% … praruditā%}

recounting Kṛṣṇa's past exploits, Vasu-
deva remembered that Kṛṣṇa had slain
Māgadha Kings ({%cakre (videhān) kāliṅga-%}

(1) The eight sons of Asurī Kālakā
were born as kings; the first of them,
the great Asura, was Jayatsena who was
the illustrious king of the Magadha country

1. 61. 45-46; (2) Kākṣīva(t) and others
were born of Śūdrā Auśīnarī from the
magnanimous sage Gautama in Maga-
dha; Gautama took his residence in
Magadha; since the kings favoured him,
he took resort with the Magadha dynasty
