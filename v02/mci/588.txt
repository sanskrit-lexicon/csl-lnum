{%bibharti ca%}) 7. 148. 34. {@B.@} Exchanged
by Indra for Karṇa's armour and ear-rings:
God Sūrya advised Karṇa to obtain from
Indra his unfailing Śakti in exchange for
({%niyamena%}) the armour ({%kavaca%}) and
the ear-rings ({%kuṇḍalas%}) which Indra
would ask Karṇa to part with 3. 286.
14-15; after receiving this hint, Karṇa long-
ing for the Śakti waited for Vāsava (Indra)
3. 286. 20; when Indra came and begged
Karṇa of his {%kavaca%} and {%kuṇḍalas,%} Karṇa
asked Indra's unfailing Śakti in return 3. 294.
20-21; Indra agreed to part with his Śakti
under the stipulation that although the Śakti,
when used by Indra, would unfailingly kill
Indra's enemies {%by hundreds%} and return to
Indra's (user's) hand, when it reached Karṇa
it would kill only {%one%} illustrious, roaring and
tormenting enemy of Karṇa and return, not to
Karṇa, but to Indra ({%seyaṃ tava karaṃ prā-%}
{%pya hatvaikaṃ ripum ūrjitam / garjantaṃ%}
{%pratapantaṃ ca mām evaiṣyati sūtaja //%})
3. 294. 23-25; the Śakti, as long as it was
with Karṇa, would fail after killing one hero
[Page145-b+ 40]
and would lose its quality of being unfailing
({%ekavīravadhe moghā%}) 7. 157. 1, 7; ({%amo-%}
{%ghāyā vighātārtham%}) 7. 157. 12; Karṇa
agreed to receive the Śakti on that condition
for he feared danger in battle only from one
enemy 3. 294. 26, 29; Indra also warned
Karṇa not to use the Śakti when other missiles
were available with him and when he was
not in danger; if used negligently the
Śakti would boomerang on Karṇa ({%vidya-%}
{%māneṣu śastreṣu yady amoghām asaṃśaye /%}
{%pramatto mokṣyase cāpi tvayyevaiṣā%}
{%patiṣyati //%}) 3. 294. 33; Karṇa vowed to
Indra ({%satyam etad bravīmi te%}) that
he would release the Vāsavī (Śakti) only
when he was in great danger 3. 294. 34;
Karṇa then received the burning Sakti in
exchange of his {%kavaca%} and {%kuṇḍalas%} 3. 294.
35, 38; 8. 5. 65. {@C.@} What the Śakti meant
to Karṇa: Karṇa had great confidence due to
the Śakti ({%ayaṃ ca pratyayaḥ karṇe śaktyā%})
7. 157. 31; when Vāsava (Indra) gave the
Śakti to Karṇa, he (Karṇa) felt that Arjuna
was as good as dead 7. 155. 21-22; with
Śakti in Karṇa's hand, no one in the world
dare oppose him 7. 155. 13; Karṇa had
preserved the Śakti to kill Arjuna 7. 122. 33;
7. 148. 34; 7. 154. 53; the Śakti meant
death for Arjuna 7. 157. 38; Duḥśāsana,
Śakuni, Jayadratha and Duryodhana always
counselled Karṇa not to use the Śakti against
any one except Arjuna 7. 157. 32-34; (cf.
7. 157. 19-21 for the use of Śakti (not named)
only against Arjuna or Kṛṣṇa); if on any
occasion Karṇa's other missiles had failed and
if he was pressed ({%pīḍitaḥ%}) by the circums-
tances, he would certainly have used his
Vāsavī Śakti against Arjuna 7. 158. 54;
hence Kṛṣṇa protected Arjuna particularly
from the unfailing Śakti which, if released,
[Page146-a+ 40]
would certainly have killed him like the light-
ning striking down a tree 7. 157. 16;
according to Vyāsa too if Arjuna and
Karṇa had clashed, the latter, after exhaus-
ting all other missiles, would have surely
used Vāsavī against Arjuna 7. 158. 56;
Kṛṣṇa was therefore always looking for a
way to render the unfailing Śakti futile
({%amoghāṃ tāṃ kathaṃ śaktiṃ moghāṃ%}
{%kuryām%}) 7. 157. 29; when the Śakti was
diverted on Ghaṭotkaca, Karṇa, in the
opinion of Kṛṣṇa, was as good as dead
7. 155. 12; when Karṇa was relieved
of his Śakti, he became an ordinary
human being ({%so 'dya mānuṣatāṃ%}
{%prāpto vimuktaḥ śakradattayā%} 7. 155. 27),
and Arjuna could dare attack him 8. 22. 33.
{@D.@} Why the Śakti was not used against
Arjuna: Both Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Sātyaki asked
Saṃjaya and Kṛṣṇa respectively why the Śakti
was not used by Karṇa against Arjuna 7.
157. 1; 7. 158. 2-3; 7. 157. 31; (1) accor-
ding to Saṃjaya's reporting, Duryodhana,
Śakuni, Duḥśāsana, and he himself urged
Karṇa every night after the day's war to use
his Śakti the next day against Arjuna or
Kṛṣṇa (7. 157. 19-21), but that counsel was
forgotten the next day during the fight due
to the watchfulness of Kṛṣṇa ({%sā tu buddhiḥ%}
{%kṛtāpy evaṃ jāgrati tridaśeśvare / aprameye%}
{%hṛṣīkeśe yuddhakāle vyamuhyata%}) 7. 157. 27;
Kṛṣṇa also never brought Arjuna face to face
with Karṇa as long as the latter was equipped
with Śakti; Kṛṣṇa managed to see that
other warriors faced Karṇa 7. 157. 28-29;
according to Saṃjaya, again, the previous
night's counsel (7. 158. 4-5) was forgotten
by Karṇa the next day due to the deities
(unfavorable) to him and to the other heroes
(on the side of the Kauravas), and thus
[Page146-b+ 40]
it was primarily due to the working of the
fate that Karṇa did not employ his Śakti
against Arjuna or Kṛṣṇa to kill any one of
them ({%tataḥ prabhātasamaye rājan karṇasya%}
{%daivataiḥ / anyeṣāṃ caiva yodhānāṃ sā%}
{%buddhir naśyate punaḥ // daivam eva paraṃ%}
{%manye yat karṇo hastasaṃsthayā / na%}
{%jaghāna raṇe pārthaṃ kṛṣṇaṃ vā devakī-%}
{%sutam //%} 7. 158. 6-7; also 8-9; (2) accor-
ding to Vyāsa too it was due to fate
({%diṣṭyā%}) that Arjuna was not locked in
a duel with Karṇa prior to the latter's being
relieved of the Śakti 7. 158. 54; according
to him Ghaṭotkaca was killed by Time
using Vāsavī as his means ({%vāsavīṃ%}
{%kāraṇaṃ kṛtvā kālenāpahato hy asau%})
7. 158. 58; (3) according to Kṛṣṇa he
deluded the mind of Karṇa and hence he did
not use his Śakti against Arjuna ({%aham%}
{%eva tu rādheyaṃ mohayāmi yudhāṃ vara%}
7. 157. 37; (4) according to Dhṛtarāṣṭra
both fate and the intelligence of Kṛṣṇa
came together to defeat the purpose of the
Kauravas and hence the Vāsavī (Śakti)
killed Ghaṭotkaca instead of Arjuna
({%daivenaiva hatā yūyaṃ svabuddhyā%}
{%keśavasya ca / gatā hi vāsavī hatvā%}
{%tṛṇabhūtaṃ ghaṭotkacam%}) 7. 158. 10.
{@E.@} Use: (1) By Karṇa: All the Kuru
warriors urged Karṇa to kill the demon
Ghaṭotkaca by using the Śakti given to him
by Vāsava and save the Kauravas and their
warriors from destruction; hearing that call,
Karṇa held the Śakti desiring to kill Ghaṭot-
kaca, that Śakti given to him by Śakra
and which he had preserved for Arjuna
for years; when the missile was released,
Ghaṭotkaca, afraid, assumed a huge form
of the foot of the Vindhya mountain and
fled; the beings in the mid-region wailed
[Page147-a+ 40]
at the sight of the Śakti; the released Śakti
first burnt the {%māyā%} of Ghaṭotkaca, and
then broke open deeply the chest of Ghaṭot-
kaca and went up in the sky, shining at night,
to enter the spaces between the {%nakṣatras%}
({%ūrdhvaṃ yayau dīpyamānā niśāyāṃ%}
{%nakṣatrāṇām antarāṇy āviśantī%} 7. 154. 57);
Ghaṭotkaca, with his vitals pierced by the
Śakti, was killed 7. 154. 48-59; 7. 156. 24;
7. 158. 10; 8. 5. 71; by asking Ghaṭotkaca
to fight with Karṇa, Kṛṣṇa diverted the Śakti
on him 7. 156. 27; 7. 157. (5), 6, 39;
7. 155. 12, 14; (Kṛṣṇa said that if
Karṇa had not killed Ghaṭotkaca with his
Śakti, he would have killed Ghaṭotkaca
7. 156. 25); (2) By Indra: When used
by Indra while fighting with the Daityas,
the Śakti, after killing his enemies by hun-
dreds, returned to Indra's hand 3. 294. 24;
3. 286. 16 (killing of the enemies by
hundreds and thousands). [See {@Śakti<sup>2-5</sup>@}]
