{@Mahopaniṣada@}¦ nt.: Name (?) of a
section (12. 326. 20-99) in the Śāntiparvan
12. 326. 100.
<div n="P">Described as being in conformity with
the four Vedas and composed according to
Sāṃkhya and the Yoga, and following the
Pañcarātra ({%idaṃ mahopaniṣadaṃ catur-%}
{%vedasamanvitam / sāṃkhyayogakṛtaṃ tena%}
[Page203-a+ 40]
{%pañcarātrānuśabditam //%}) 12. 326. 100: it
was sung by Nārāyaṇa ({%nārāyaṇamukhod-%}
{%gīta%} 12. 326. 101) to Nārada when he visited
the great Śvetadvīpa (12. 325. 1); in it
Nārāyaṇa is described to Nārada as one eternal
Person, Vāsudeva ({%ekaṃ puruṣaṃ vāsudevaṃ%}
{%sanātanam%} 12. 326. 31), who is called the
soul of the world ({%lokasyāṃeti kathyate%}
12. 326. 21) or the soul of all beings
({%sarvabhūtātmabhuto hi vāsudevaḥ%} 12. 326.
31); that Puraṣa is devoid of activity and
can be seen only through knowledge; there is
nothing beyond that eternal Puruṣa ({%puruṣo%}

{%taraṃ puruṣād vai sanātanāt%} 12. 326. 30);
one should know him to be the eternal,
highest self Vāsudeva (12. 326. 24);
he, the {%kṣetrajña,%} enjoys the three {%guṇas%}
{%sattva, rajas%} and {%tamas,%} but is not
affected by them (12. 326. 27, 21); that
Vāsudeva himself ({%kṣetrajña%}) is Saṃkar-
ṣaṇa ({%jīva%}), from whom arises Pradyumna
({%manas%}), and from Pradyumna arises Ani-
ruddha ({%ahaṃkāra%}) (12. 326, 38-39; 35-
37, 68-69); all gods and sages resort to him
and the entire world is contained in him
(12. 326, 47-55); his incarnations from
Varāha to Kṛṣṇa are narrated in 12. 326.
71-93; having thus told Nārada all that was
past. and also the future, with its secret the
blessed God disappeared ({%etat te sarvam%}
