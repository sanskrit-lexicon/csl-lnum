{@Āgneyāstra<sup>1</sup>@}¦ nt.: Name of a missile;
referred to as Āgni-astra in {%ubhe caivāgni-%}
{%mārute%} 5. 140. 6.
{@A.@} Origin and succession: Arjuna
told Gandharva Aṅgāraparṇa that Bṛhaspati
gave it first to Bharadvāja, Bharadvāja to
sage Agniveśya, Agniveśya to Droṇa, and
Droṇa to Arjuna 1. 158. 26-27; 1. 121. 6-7;
but Arjuna told Uttara that he obtained
Āgneyāstra from god Agni 4. 56. 14; when
Gandharva Aṅgāraparṇa expressed his desire
to learn the {%astra,%} Arjuna taught it to him in
exchange of the Gandharva horses ({%gandhar-%}
{%vajāḥ … hayāḥ%} 1. 158. 51) 1. 158. 54-55;
Arjuna taught it to the Gandharva with due
rites ({%yathāvidhi%}) 1. 174. 3; when Arjuna
requested Indra for heavenly weapons, Indra
assured him that he would give him all the
heavenly missiles, {%āgneya%} and the rest
({%āgneyāni ca sarvāṇi%}) after Arjuna had
satisfied god Mahādeva 1. 225. 12, 10; among
the epic heroes, besides Droṇa and Arjuna,
[Page091-b+ 40]
its use was known also to Kṛṣṇa (6. 116. 38;
also see {@Āgneyāstra<sup>2</sup>@}), Bhīṣma, Karṇa and
Aśvatthāman (7. 166. 2) [See the section {@C@}
below]. {@B.@} Description: divine ({%divya%})
6. 116. 38; 7. 73. 46; very dreadful ({%mahā-%}
{%ghora%}) 7. 73. 46; very frightful ({%sudāruṇa%})
4. 59. 21; irresistible even by the gods ({%devair%}
{%api sudurdharṣam%}) 7. 172. 14. {@C.@} Its
use in war and its effects: 1. In the epic
war: (i) when used by Karṇa against
Arjuna, it gave to Karṇa's bow a fiery
look and it released fiery arrows; Arjuna
apparently combated it with the same kind of
{%astra (astraṃ astreṇa saṃvārya%}) 7. 31. 51-
52; (ii) used by Droṇa against Yuyudhāna
(Sātyaki); this was combated by Sātyaki
with Vāruṇāstra 7. 73. 46; (iii) Bhāradvāja
(Droṇa) used Āgneya and other heavenly
missiles against Yudhiṣṭhira which were ren-
dered ineffective by Yudhiṣṭhira 7. 132. 29-30;
(iv) Aśvatthāman used it against Arjuna;
when released, it produced a shower of
arrows ({%śaravarṣam ajāyata%} 7. 172. 16;
{%śaravṛṣṭayaḥ%} 7. 172. 22); cold winds blew, sun
lost its lustre, clouds rained blood, all beings
became restless; the arrows were fiery and
produced good deal of heat; they burnt down
enemies, elephants, horses and chariots; the
god Fire burnt the army like the Saṃvartaka
fire at the end of the aeon 7. 172. 16-27; the
whole army, including Arjuna, could not be
seen due to the darkness; the like of the {%astra%}
released by Aśvatthāman was never seen
before by Saṃjaya and his colleagues 7. 172.
30-31; Arjuna combated it with Brāhma Astra
7. 172. 14, 32; it was meant to be used by
Arjuna in the war 5. 140. 6 (here referred to
as Āgni instead of Āgneya). 2. Outside
the epic war: (i) Arjuna used it against
Gandharva Aṅgāraparṇa; when released, it
[Page092-a+ 39]
burnt down the excellent chariot of Aṅgāra-
parṇa, and he fell down, head downwards, as
he swooned due to the lustre of the missile 1.
158. 28, 29, 37; (ii) used by Droṇa (besides
using other divine missiles) against Arjuna at
the time of the cattle-raid; Arjuna combated
it with his Āgneyāstra 4. 53. 48; (iii) on the
same occasion used by Bhīṣma and Arjuna
against each other to combat each other's
missiles 4. 59. 21; (iv) in his fight with
Citrasena and the Gandharvas Arjuna killed
thousands of Gandharvas with Āgneyāstra
3. 234. 7; when released once again, the
Gandharvas, afflicted by heat, were dejected
3. 234. 17; (v) at the time of displaying
his skill in the use of missiles, Arjuna
produced fire by releasing Āgneyāstra 1. 125.
19; (vi) employed by Bhīṣma against
Rāma (Jāmadagnya); it was rendered in-
effective by the counter-use of Vāruṇāstra
5. 181. 12. {@D.@} Mode of use: The normal
arrows were supposed to be infused by this
{%astra%} ({%astre te vāruṇāgneye tābhyāṃ%}
{%bāṇasamāhite%} 7. 73. 48) by reciting {%mantras%}
over it ({%anumantrya%} 5. 181. 12, {%abhimantrya%}
7. 172. 15); Aśvatthāman also sipped water
({%vāry upaspṛśya%} 7. 172. 14) before reciting
{%mantras.%} {@E.@} Status: Inferior to Śivā's
Pāśupatāstra 13. 14. 127.
