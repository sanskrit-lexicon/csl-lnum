{@Jaya@}¦ m.: Name of a type of Itihāsa
({%jayo nāmetihāso 'yam%}) 1. 56. 19; 5. 134.
17; 18. 5. 39.
<div n="P">Usually this is considered to be the desi-
gnation of that text which was originally
composed by Vyāsa and later, with gradual
additions, grew to become the Bhārata and the
[Page182-b+ 40]
Mahābhārata at the hands of Vaiśāṃpāyana
and Sūta Ugraśravas respectively; as the name
of the Mahābhārata it probably occurs in the
opening {%maṅgala śloka%} found at the begin-
ning of the different {%parvans (nārāyaṇaṃ%}
{%namaskṛtya naraṃ caiva narottamam /%}
{%devīṃ sarasvatīṃ caiva tato jayam udīra-%}
{%yet //)%} which is not found in all the versions;
according to V. S. Sukthankar, however,
“ … Jaya is a {%generic%} name applicable to
different works, and not a specific name of
the Mahābhārata at all as believed by some
writers” (Ādiparvan, p. 989, note on 56. 19);
the recitation of this kind of Itihāsa should
be heard by a king who desires victory; he
then conquers the earth and shall defeat his
enemies; it should also often be heard by a
chief queen since it is as good as a rite
calculated to lead to the birth of a son ({%puṃ-%}
{%savanam%}) and by a crown prince since it
is the royal road to welfare ({%svastyayanaṃ%}
{%mahat%}) 1. 56. 19-20; its recitation is re-
commended for a king desiring prosperity
({%bhūtim%}), for princes in general, and for
any pregnant woman; it is also said that
hearing it one who desires heaven will
go to heaven, one who wants victory will
win victory, and a pregnant woman will
deliver a son or a fortunate girl ({%putraṃ%}
{%kanyāṃ vā bahubhāginīm%}) 18. 5. 39-40; the
narrative called the Vidurāputrānuśāsana
(5. 131-135) is also classed as the Jaya
type of Itihāsa 5. 134. 17; a minister should
recite this to a king who is oppressed by his
enemies and who is dejected since this tract,
being a powerful exhortation, is best suited
to cause increase in energy ({%idam uddha-%}
{%raṇaṃ bhīmaṃ tejovardhanam uttamam%});
the rest of the {%śravaṇaphala%} given here is
the same as for the Mahābhārata (as a Jaya
[Page183-a+ 39]
type of composition) with the addition which
gives the qualities of the son to be born to
a woman 5. 134. 16-21.
