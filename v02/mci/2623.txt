A certain prince, not named, of Haihayas
thought that he had killed a sage mistaking
him to be a deer; he reported the incident
to Haihayas; dejected, Haihayas ({%dīna-%}
{%mānasāḥ%} 3. 182. 7) went in search of the
dead sage; they reached the hermitage of
Tārkṣya Ariṣṭanemi; they were duly receiv-
ed by him ({%teṣāṃ pūjām athāharat%} 3. 182.
9); Haihayas, however, considered that
they were unworthy of the honour since
they had killed a Brāhmaṇa; they told
Ariṣṭanemi that they had searched for him
but could not find him; then they were
told by Ariṣṭanemi that they had commi-
tted no sin since whom they thought they
had killed was his son who was alive, and
was present in his {%āśrama;%} Haihayas asked
Tārkṣya how his dead son came back to
life; they were told that since Ariṣṭanemi
and his son always acted truthfully and
never cherished a lie, and since they follow-
ed religion they had no fear from death
({%satyam evābhijānīmo nānṛte kurmahe%}
{%manaḥ / svadharmam anutiṣṭhāmas tasmān%}
{%mṛtyubhayaṃ na naḥ%} 3. 182. 17); when
Haihayas knew that they were sinless, they
were delighted ({%hṛṣṭāḥ%}) and they returned
to their country 3. 182. 21; (2) Rāma
Jāmadagnya killed thousands of Haihayas
[Page933-b+ 40]

Arjuna's sons and grandsons and made
the earth full of their blood-stained mud
({%cakāra bhārgavō rājan mahīṃ śoṇita-%}
{%kardamām%}) 12. 49. 45-46; after many years,
the Earth when not properly protected by
Kṣatriyas entered Rasātala and requested
Kaśyapa to see that some eminent Kṣa-
triyas protected her again; she specifically
mentioned for this purpose the Kṣatriyas
born in the family of Haihayas who were
protected by her when Paraśurāma killed all
Kṣatriyas ({%santi … nṛṣu kṣatriyapuṃgavāḥ /%}
{%haihayānāṃ kule jātās te saṃrakṣantu māṃ%}
{%mune%}) 12. 49. 66; a reference to the killing
of Haihayas and of Kārtavīrya is made in
the Parvasaṃgrahaparvan while listing the
events of the Āraṇyakaparvan 1. 2. 117
(actually the event referred to here is des-
cribed in the Śāntiparvan as noted above;
the event briefly mentioned in the Āra-
ṇyakaparvan is different; see the next); (3)

Haihayas were attacked by Brāhmaṇas,
Vaiśyas and Śūdras; they were again and
again defeated by the Haihayas; the Brāh-
maṇas asked them the secret of their victory;
Haihayas replied saying that on the battle-
field they listened only to one among them
who had superior judgement; the Brāh-
maṇas and the rest who attacked them were
divided, each following his own judgement;
the Brāhmaṇas then chose one of them
who was skilled in policies and defeated
the Kṣatriya (Haihayas) ({%vayam ekasya%}

5. 153. 4-9; (5) Udāvarta, king of
