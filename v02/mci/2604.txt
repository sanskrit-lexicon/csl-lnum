kas to a small number ({%kṛtvā somakān%}
[Page924-b+ 40]
{%alpaśeṣān%}) 1. 1. 127; (2) At the start of
the {%svayaṃvara%} of Draupadi, the priest of
Somakas (in such contexts they are identi-
fied with Pāñcālas) gave offerings in fire,
asked Brāhmaṇas to pronounce benediction
({%brāhmaṇān svasti vācya ca%}) and then
stopped the sound of musical instruments
1. 176. 31-32; (3) Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked
Saṃjaya how strong Somakas were with
Dhṛṣṭadyumna as their general ({%dhṛṣṭa-%}
{%dyumnena senānyā somakāḥ kimbalā iva%})
5. 49. 9; (4) Duryodhana and others
thought that if Kṛṣṇa was arrested Pāṇḍa-
vas and Somakas would give up all their
effort ({%nirudyamā bhaviṣyanti%}) 5. 128. 7;
(5) When Pāṇḍavas had settled down at

messenger to them and Somakas 5. 157.
3; (6) Bhīṣma had assured Duryodhana
that he would kill Pāṇḍavas and Somakas
5. 170. 2; (7) Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya
how did Kurus and Pāṇḍava-Somakas
fight with one another at Kurukṣetra;
thereupon Saṃjaya described to him how
they fought when Somakas, determined to
win or die while engaged in fighting, attack-
ed Kauravas ({%āśaṃsanto jayaṃ yuddhe%}
{%vadhaṃ vābhimukhā raṇe%}) 6. 1. 1-4; Kau-
ravas and Pāṇḍava-Somakas sat together
before the start of the war and mutually
agreed upon certain conventions and
rules to be followed in the war ({%tatas te%}
{%samayaṃ cakruḥ kurupāṇḍavasomakāḥ /%}
{%dharmāṃś ca sthāpayām āsur yuddhānām%}
{% … //%}) 6. 1. 26, 33; the conventions and
rules detailed in 6. 1. 27-32; (8) Duryo-
dhana told Duḥśāsana that if Bhīṣma was
protected in war he would kill Pāṇḍavas,
Somakas and Sṛñjayas 6. 16. 14; (9) When
Arjuna got prepared for the war Somakas
[Page925-a+ 40]
and others blew their conches 6. 41. 2;
(10) On the second day of the war,
Dhṛṣṭadyumna and Somakas showered
arrows on Droṇa 6. 48. 30; (11) On the
third day, Kṛṣṇa noticed Bhīṣma routing
Somakas chased by the delighted Kauravas
({%prabhagnān dṛśya somakān%}) 6. 55. 68;
(12) On the fifth day, when Bhīṣma
started killing Pāñcālas and Somakas, they
acted nobly and decided to attack Bhīṣma
({%āryāṃ yuddhe matiṃ kṛtvā bhīṣmam%}
{%evābhidudruvuḥ%}) 6. 68. 31; (13) On the
sixth day, Śikhaṇḍin surrounded by Soma-
kas and Irāvant stood at the ‘tail’ of
the Makaravyūha of Pāṇḍavas ({%pucche%}
{%makarasya%}) 6. 71. 4, 11; Somakas were
terrified ({%vitresuḥ%}) to hear the sound of
Droṇa's conch when he blew it after defeat-
ing Drupada 6. 73. 46; (14) On the eighth
day, when the Pāṇḍava army attacked
Bhīṣma he killed Pāñcālas, Somakas and
Sṛñjayas with his arrows; nevertheless,
abandoning the fear of death they attacked
Bhīṣma ({%tyaktvā mṛtyukṛtaṃ bhayam%})
6. 84. 2-4; battle that ensued, in which
Bhīṣma cut off their hands and heads and
felled down those riding chariots, horses
and elephants ({%virathān rathinaś cakre;%}
{%hayebhyo hayasādinām; nirmanuṣyāṃś ca%}
{%mātaṅgāñ … %}), described in 6. 84. 5-7;
when Droṇa attacked Somakas and Sṛñjayas
in order to kill them ({%abhyadravata … %}
{%preṣayiṣyam yamakṣayam%}) a loud cry was
raised by Sṛñjayas (by implication also by
Somakas) ({%tatrākrando mahān āsīt sṛñja-%}
{%yānām%}) 6. 85. 20-21; that night, Karṇa
assured Duryodhana that he would kill all
Pārthas and Somakas if Bhīṣma laid down
his arms and left the battlefield 6. 93. 13;
Duryodhana then went to Bhīṣma and
[Page925-b+ 40]
reminded him that he had assured him
(Duryodhana) to kill Somakas; he asked
Bhīṣma to carry out his assurance by killing
Somakas 6. 93. 37-38; thereupon Bhīṣma
once again assured Duryodhana that next
day he would either kill Somakas and Pāñ-
cālas to delight him or they would kill
him ({%tair vāhaṃ nihataḥ saṃkhye gamiṣye%}
{%yamasādanam / tān vā nihatya saṃgrāme%}
{%prītim dāsyāmi vai tava //%}) 6. 94. 14-15;
(15) On the ninth day, in the morning,
Duryodhana asked the kings to get ready
with their armies since Bhīṣma was going
to kill that day Somakas ({%adya bhīṣmo … %}
{%nihaniṣyati somakān%}) 6. 95. 1; at mid-day,
Bhīṣma fought a fierce battle with Somakas
blowing them away by hundreds and thou-
sands with his sharp arrows ({%vyadhaman%}
{% … śataśo 'tha sahasraśaḥ%}) 6. 99. 1-2;
in the evening when the sun had set
({%bhāskare 'stam upāgate%} 6. 103. 1), Yudhi-
ṣṭhira seeing that great chariot-fighters
among Somakas had been defeated and
had lost enthusiasm ({%jitān dṛṣtvā … nirut-%}
{%sāhān mahārathān%}) felt like ordering
cessation of hostilities for that day ({%ava-%}
{%hāram arocayat%}) 6. 103. 4; (16) Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya how, on the tenth
day, did Bhīṣma face Pāṇḍavas while at
the same time killing Somakas 6. 104. 25;
Dhṛṣṭadyumna, aided by Somakas, attack-
ed Droṇa 6. 111. 30; Bhīṣma, when attack-
ed by Śikhaṇḍin, killed Somakas who
followed Arjuna ({%pārthapadānugān%}) 6.
112. 64; none of the great chariot-fighters
of Somakas hoped to live after facing
Bhīṣma in battle ({%na … yaḥ saṃprāpya raṇe%}
{%bhīṣmaṃ jīvite sma mano dadhe%}) 6. 112.
75; exhorted by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Somakas
and Sṛñjayas rushed at Bhīṣma showering
[Page926-a+ 40]
weapons on him from all sides ({%abhyadra-%}
{%vanta … śastravṛṣṭyā samantataḥ%}) 6. 113.
16-17; Somakas and Pāñcālas were delight-
ed when Bhīṣma fell down 6. 114. 107;
(17) On the fourteenth day, when Droṇa
started killing Somakas no one succeeded
in facing him, nor was any one able to
pierce him (with an arrow) ({%na cāpya-%}
{%bhiyayuḥ kecid apare naiva vivyadhuḥ%}) 7.
85. 34; watching the fierce duel between
Satyasena and Sātyaki, Kauravas and
Somakas praised them 7. 94. 7; in the
afternoon of that day, Droṇa again fought
with Somakas ({%aparāhṇe … saṃgrāmaḥ%}
{%samapadyata / … punar droṇasya somakalḥ%})
7. 101. 1; when the different alignments of
the Pāṇḍava army were being agitated by
Droṇa ({%vyūheṣv āloḍyamāneṣu%}), Pāṇḍavas,
Pāñcālas and Somakas went deep into the
army of Kauravas ({%sudūram anvayuḥ%}); the
battle fought was so fierce that it looked
like the end of the world ({%yugānta iva%}
{%bhārata%}) 7. 102. 1-2; when Bhīma
marched to offer assistance to Arjuna,
Pāñcālas and Somakas followed him 7.
102. 67; after the death of Jayadratha, in
the evening ({%astaṃ gacchati bhāskare%}),
Droṇa fought a fierce battle with Somakas
({%somakaiḥ sārdham saṃgrāmo lomaharṣa-%}
{%ṇaḥ%}); at that time great chariot-fighters
of Somakas made every attempt to kill
Droṇa ({%te tu sarve prayatnena bhāradvājaṃ%}
{%jighāṃsavaḥ / … ayudhyanta mahārathāḥ //%})
7. 121. 45-46; Droṇa sent a message to
Aśvatthāman through Duryodhana not to
spare Somakas in order to save his own
life ({%na somakāḥ pramoktavyā jīvitaṃ%}
{%parirakṣatā%}) 7. 126. 33; (18) In the
night war (which took place between the
fourteenth and the fifteenth day), Duryo-
[Page926-b+ 40]
dhana assured his fleeing army that he
would himself kill Pārthas together with
Pāñcālas and Somakas 7. 134. 54: Duryo-
dhana requested Aśvatthāman to kill
Pāñcālas and Somakas who, agitated, were
moving in his army like a conflagration;
he should kill them before they killed
Kauravas ({%ete hi somakā … mama sainyeṣu%}
{%saṃrabdhā vicaranti davāgnivat%}) 7. 134.
76-78; Aśvatthāman assured Duryodhana
that for his sake and to delight him he
would fight with Pāñcālas, Somakas and
Kekayas ({%eṣa gacchāmi saṃgrāme tvat-%}
{%kṛte … / … tvatpriyārtham%}); scorched by
his arrows, Somakas and others would
run away in all directions; seeing his
valour, Yudhiṣṭhira and Somakas would
consider the world full of Aśvatthāman
({%aśvatthāmamayaṃ lokaṃ maṃsyante%});
Yudhiṣṭhira would be dejected seeing the
slain Pāñcālas and Somakas; Aśvatthāman
would kill only those who engaged him in
battle ({%ye māṃ yuddhe 'bhiyotsyanti tān%}
{%haniṣyāmi … %}); once Somakas were within
his reach they would not return alive 7.
135. 10-14; in the battle that followed
Pāñcālas and Somakas fled 7. 135. 20;
Sṛñjayas, Pāñcālas, Matsyas and Somakas
followed Arjuna and Bhīma to attack Droṇa
from right and left respectively ({%bībhatsur%}
{%dakṣiṇaṃ pārśvam uttaraṃ tu vṛkodaraḥ%})
7. 136. 13-14; Duryodhana advised his
brothers to offer protection to Droṇa so
that he would be able to kill Pārthas,
Somakas and Sṛñjayas along with their
kings ({%somakān hanyāt sṛñjayāṃś ca sarā-%}
{%jakān%}) 7. 139. 21, 24; in the midst of the
fierce night war ({%raudre rātriyuddhe%}),
Yudhiṣṭhira exhorted Pāṇḍavas and Soma-
kas to attack Droṇa alone in order to kill
[Page927-a+ 40]
him; accordingly, they attacked Droṇa
uttering frightening cries ({%abhyadravata%}
{%gacchadhvaṃ droṇam eva jighāṃsayā / … %}
{%droṇam evābhyavartanta nadanto bhaira-%}
{%vān ravān%}) 7. 140. 2-3; when Karṇa's son
Vṛṣasena cut off the armours of Drupada's
army, Somakas, frightened, fied ({%somakā%}
{%vipradudruvuḥ%}); while they were running
away they appeared bright due to the light
of the torches ({%tatas tu drupadānīkaṃ%}
{%śaraiś chinnatanucchadam / saṃprādravat%}
{% … /dravamāṇāś ca somakāḥ vyarājanta … %}
{%pradīpair avabhāsitāḥ%}); after defeating
great Somaka charriot-fighters Vṛṣasena
turned towards Yudhiṣṭhira 7. 143. 21, 24-
25, 28; when Śikhaṇḍin, defeated by Kṛpa
turned back, Somakas and others covered
him on all sides; then the battle started
again 7. 144. 25, 27-28; seeing Droṇa kill-
ing the Pāṇḍava army ({%pāṇḍavīṃ camūm%}),
Somakas quickly pierced him by showering
arrows ({%vivyadhuḥ somakās tūrṇaṃ … %}
{%śaravṛṣṭibhiḥ%}); but Droṇa deprived them
of their lives 7. 147. 13-14; Kṛṣṇa drew
Arjuna's attention to Bhīma who, cover-
ed by Somakas and the Pāṇḍava army,
attacked Droṇa and Karṇa ({%vṛtaḥ somaka-%}
{%pāṇḍavaiḥ%}) 7. 147. 28; when only the three
parts of the (last quarter of the) night
remained and the sun was about to rise,
Droṇa divided his army into two parts and
attacked Somakas and Pāṇḍavas along with
Pāñcālas ({%tribhāgamātraśeṣāyām rātryāṃ;%}
{%aruṇo 'bhyudayāṃ cakre%}) 7. 161. 1-3 (Nī.
on Bom. Ed. 7. 186. 1; {%tribhāgamātraśeṣā-%}
{%yāṃ muhūrtatrayāvaśiṣṭāyām%}); (19) On
the fifteenth day, Droṇa released {%brāhma%}
missile trying to kill all Somakas ({%vinighnan%}
{%sarvasomakān%}) 7. 164. 80; just before the
fall of Droṇa, Kurus and Somakas got
[Page927-b+ 40]
mixed up with one another in a battle
shouting and felling each other with wea-
pons ({%tataḥ pravṛtte saṃgrāme vimiśrāḥ%}
{%kurusomakāḥ / … śastrair dehān apāta-%}
{%yan // %}) 7. 165. 99; when the fleeing Pāñcāla
warriors did not return to fight they were
made to stand still where they were by
Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna (7. 171. 67-69; 7. 172.
1-2); only Arjuna, along with Somakas
and the constituents of their armies (?)
returned to fight with Aśvatthāman ({%eka%}
{%eva tu bībhatsuḥ somakāvayavaiḥ saha%})
7. 172. 3 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 7. 201. 3;
{%somakāvayavaiḥ somakānām avayavarūpair%}
{%māṇḍalikaiḥ%}); (20) On the sixteenth day,
when Aṅgas attacked Nakula, Pāṇḍavas,
Pāñcālas and Somakas attacked them to
cover Nakula ({%nakulaṃ … pari petuḥ … %}
{%pāṇḍupāñcālasomakāḥ%}); then chariot-
fighters fought with elephant-riders ({%rathi-%}
{%nāṃ hastibhiḥ saha%}) 8. 17. 21-22; when
Somakas were being killed by the arrows
of Karṇa, afflicted by pain and wounded
by arrows, they hid themselves ({%avālīyanta%}
{%rājendra vedanārtāḥ śarārditāḥ%}); (the
Kaurava army too, being killed by Nakula,
dispersed in all directions); the two armies
then, standing beyond the range of arrows,
chose to act as spectators ({%te sene … %}
{%prekṣakavat sthite%}) 8. 17. 73-75; (21)
Even after the battle of the sixteenth day,
Dhṛtarāṣṭra was confident that Karṇa alone
was capable of killing Pāṇḍavas and Soma-
kas 8. 22. 16; (22) On the seventeenth
day, Arjuna felt that by killing Karṇa he
would give satisfaction to the great chariot-
fighters of Somakas for having fulfilled
their task to help their allies in war ({%kṛtaṃ%}
{%kāryaṃ ca manyantāṃ mitrakāryepsavo%}
{%yudhi%}) 8. 52. 25; Karṇa in the afternoon
[Page928-a+ 40]
({%aparāhṇe%}) of that day killed all Somakas
in the presence of Bhīma 8. 56. 7, 53;
Arjuna expressed his fear to Kṛṣṇa that
if Kṛpa, Kṛtavarman and Aśvatthāman
were not killed they would cause the des-
truction of Somakas ({%avadhyamānās te%}
{%'smābhir ghātayiṣyanti somakān%}) 8. 57. 5;
Karṇa fought a great battle with Somakas
in which he crushed them while destroy-
ing their chariots and killing horses and
elephants ({%sumahat … cakre yuddhaṃ soma-%}
{%kān saṃpramṛdnan%}) 8. 60. 14; when Karṇa
came up to Arjuna to kill him, Somakas
urged ({%abhyakrośan%}) Arjuna to hasten to
pierce Karṇa (with an arrow), cut off his
head without delay and shatter the hope
of Duryodhana to get kingdom ({%vidhya%}
{%karṇam / chinddhy asya mūrdhānam alaṃ%}
{%cireṇa śraddhāṃ ca rājyād dhṛtarāṣṭra-%}
{%sūnoḥ%}) 8. 65. 10; when Karṇa cover-
ed ({%samācinot%}) Arjuna with a hundred
Kṣudraka arrows and pierced ({%bibheda%})
Kṛṣṇa with sixty arrows, Somakas fied;
Arjuna stopped them ({%tadantaraṃ somakāḥ%}
{%prādravanta / … pārthaḥ somakān pratya-%}
{%gṛhṇāt%}) 8. 65. 32-34; seeing Karṇa lying
dead on the ground, Somakas, delighted,
made loud noise, sounded musical instru-
ments and shook their (upper) garments
and hands; others danced and embraced
each other saying: “Karṇa is pierced with
an arrow as fire is extinguished by a strong
wind at the end of a sacrifice or at day-
break in a bedroom; Karṇa's body with
arrows all over it and smeared with blood
shines like sun with his rays; the sun in
the form of Karṇa has been forced to set
by Kāla in the form of Arjuna; as the sun
while setting takes away his light, so has
the arrow taken away Karṇa's life” 8.
[Page928-b+ 39]
67. 28-32; after the death of Karṇa, in the
evening, at the foot of the Himavant
({%haimavate prasthe%} 9. 5. 1) and near the
river Sarasvatī (9. 4. 49), Śalya when
requested by Duryodhana to lead the army
(9. 5. 26-27), he (Śalya) assured him that
he would defeat Pārthas and Somakas in
battle 9. 6. 3; after Śalya's election as the
general, the great chariot-fighters of Madra-
kas while praising Śalya said that he was
capable of defeating in battle even gods,
demons and men, let alone Somakas and
Sṛñjayas ({%kimu somakasṛñjayān%}) 9. 6. 9;
that night, in the camp of Pāṇḍavas, Kṛṣṇa
encouraged Yudhiṣṭhira to fight with Śalya;
after he left, Yudhiṣṭhira gave leave to
Pāñcālas and Somakas to leave his camp
({%visṛjya pāñcālān atha somakān%}) 9. 6. 39;
(23) On the eighteenth day when Bhīma
attacked Kṛpa, the great chariot-fighters of
Somakas too attacked him and others in
order to kill their opponents ({%abhya-%}
{%dravanta … jighāṃsantaḥ parān yudhi%}) 9.
7. 31; Somakas fell down by thousands
due to the arrows of Śalya; after a while,
Śalya again struck down Somakas and
Pāṇḍava army and caused distress to Yudhi-
ṣṭhira ({%somakāś ca sahasraśaḥ / patitāḥ;%}
{%śalyo 'pi … nighnan somakapāṇḍavān / … %}
{%yudhiṣṭhiram apīḍayat%}) 9. 10. 21, 41;
when Yudhiṣṭhira announced his decision
to kill Śalya, the army of Pāṇḍavas, espe-
cially the Pāñcālas, Somakas and Matsyas,
expressed delight which helped the fulfil-
ment of Yudhiṣṭhira's vow (i. e. encouraged
him) ({%tataḥ praharṣaḥ sainyānāṃ … pāñcā-%}
{%lānāṃ somakānāṃ matsyānāṃ ca viśeṣataḥ /%}
{%pratijñāṃ tāṃ ca saṅgrāme dharmarājasya%}
{%pūrayan%}) 9. 15. 26-27; seeing Śalya, killing
[Page929-a+ 40]
his opponents, angered Somakas and others,
surrounded him ({%parivavruḥ%}) 9. 16. 6;
after the death of Śalya, when the Madra
army attacked the Pāṇḍava army, Somakas
and others covered Yudhiṣṭhira on all
sides to protect him ({%yudhiṣṭhiraṃ parī-%}
{%psantaḥ samantāt paryavārayan%}) 9. 17. 8;
Somakas and others thought that the ele-
phant of king Śālva (9. 19. 2-3), though
one, was moving in thousand forms around
them ({%tam eva nāgaṃ dadṛśuḥ samantāt /%}
{%sahasraśo vai vicarantam ekam%}) 9. 19. 6;
Duryodhana alone halted ({%avārayat%}) with
his sharp missiles the attack of Somakas
and others 9. 20. 34; Aśvatthāman assured
Duryodhana who had taken shelter in the
Dvaipāyana lake that he would kill Soma-
kas and others on that very day ({%adya%}
{%nihaniṣyāmi somakān%}) 9. 29. 19; when
Duryodhana's whereabouts became known,
delighted Somakas shouted loudly ({%prā-%}
{%krośan somakās tatra%}) 9. 29. 48; Somakas
and others held Duryodhana in high regard
({%sarva evābhyapūjayan%}) when he cha-
llenged Bhīma to prove his boasts 9. 55.
40; after the duel began, Somakas and
Pāṇḍavas were afraid when they noticed
the velocity of the wind produced by
Duryodhana's mace ({%gadā mārutavegaṃ hi%}
{%dṛṣṭvā%}) 9. 56. 31; when at one stage
Bhīma lost consciousness due to the stroke
of Duryodhana's mace on his chest, Soma-
kas and Pāṇḍavas, their hopes dashed to
the ground, became dejected ({%bhṛśopahata-%}
{%saṃkalpā nahṛṣṭamanaso 'bhavan%}) 9. 56.
49; Somakas were thrilled to see Duryo-
dhana fall down ({%dadṛśuḥ hṛṣṭaromāṇaḥ%})
9. 58. 2; the chief warriors among Somakas,
who were righteous, did not approve of
Bhīma's putting his foot on the head of
[Page929-b+ 40]
fallen Duryodhana ({%nābhyanandan dharmā-%}
{%tmānaḥ somakānāṃ prabarhāḥ%}) 9. 58.
13; (24) Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya
whether Kṛpa and Kṛtavarman took part
in destroying the camp of Pāṇḍavas and in
killing them and Somakas while fighting,
and then go the way Duryodhana did
(i. e. die in battle) ({%kaccit pramathya%}
{%śibiraṃ hatvā somakapāṇḍavān / duryo-%}
{%dhanasya padavīṃ gatau paramikāṃ raṇe //%})
10. 8. 3; while moving in the camp, Aśva-
tthāman happened to see the sons of Drau-
padī and the surviving Somakas ({%ava-%}
{%śiṣṭāṃś ca somakān%}) 10. 8. 44; as far as
the destruction of Somakas, who were
asleep and not on their guard, was con-
cerned that night proved to be extremely
cruel ({%evaṃvidhā hi sā rātriḥ somakānāṃ%}
{%janakṣaye / prasuptānāṃ pramattānām āsīt%}
{%subhṛśadāruṇā //%}) 10. 8. 142; Aśvatthāman
was delighted that Somakas and the Mat-
syas who had survived were all killed by
him; he felt that he and his associates
had done their duty; he wanted to give
that very delightful news to Duryodhana
if he was still alive ({%somakā matsyaśeṣāś%}
