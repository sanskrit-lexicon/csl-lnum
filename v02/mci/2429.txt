Although they lived in countries they led
the life of Dasyus ({%sarve viṣayavāsinaḥ / … %}
{%sarve te dasyujīvinaḥ //%}) 12. 65. 15; Karṇa
repeated for Śalya {%gāthās%} describing the
nature and behaviour of Madrakas, which
were once recited by certain Brāhmaṇas in
the royal assembly of Kurus: a Madraka
was a habitual violator of contracts; who-
ever hated Brāhmaṇas was a Madraka;
there could be no companionship with a
Madraka; Madrakas were wicked to the
bitter end ({%mitradhruṅ madrako nityaṃ%}

{%tmyaṃ madrakeṣv iti naḥ śrutam //%}) 8.
27. 73-74; Madraka men and women
united with one another without regard
for family or any other relationship; they
could never be religious; they ate churn-
ed meal, drank wine, ate beef, roared
and danced 8. 27. 75-78; one should
neither form friendship nor have enmity
with Madrakas with whom religion was lost
and whose unauspicious deeds were well
known ({%madrakeṣu vilupteṣu prakhyātā-%}

should not touch Madrakas ({%madrakeṣu ca%}
{%duḥsparśam%}) 8. 27. 80; Madraka women
are severely criticized for their shameful
acts and licentious behaviour 8. 27. 85-
89; from beginning to the end Madrakas
followed reprehensible bad paths; they
were {%mlecchas%} born in sinful countries
and had no sense of religion; there could
be no question of their knowing {%dharma%}

{%avicakṣaṇāḥ //)%} 8. 27. 90-91; one of the
old Brāhmaṇas who had visited many
countries, when he met Dhṛtarāṣṭra, he
condemned Bāhlīkas and also Madras
({%madrāṃś ca kutsayan vākyam abravīt%})
8. 30. 9; therefore what he said despising
specifically the Bāhlīkas applied also to
Madrakas 8. 30. 10-26; a certain Brāh-
maṇa told an artisan ({%śīlpin%}) what he
had heard about Madrakas: among
Madrakas in every family there was only
one wise person, the rest behaved as they
liked; their behaviour led to confusion
of {%dharma (bhavaty ekaḥ kule vipraḥ%}
{%śiṣṭānye kāmacāriṇaḥ / etan mayā śrutaṃ%}
{%tatra dharmasaṃkarakārakam / )%} 8. 30. 55-
56; another Brāhmaṇa told the Kuru
assembly describing Madras as croocked
and said that all countries, except Madras
and Pañcanadas, followed the ancient
{%dharma (dharmaṃ purāṇam upajīvanti%}
{%santo madrān ṛte pañcanadāṃś ca jihmān)%}
8. 30. 62; according to a Rākṣasa named
Kalmāṣapāda, who was held by a king,
Madra women were as good as the
[Page824-a+ 40]
dirt on the bodies of women ({%strīṇāṃ%}
{%madrastriyo malam%}) 8. 30. 68; he further
said that the dirt on the bodies of Madra-
kas, whose sacrifices were performed by
those whose sacrificial priests were of
warrior class, would be the dirt of the
king if he did not release Kalmāṣapāda

(7. 19. 4) by hundreds of thousands with
elephants, horses, chariots and foot-soldiers
({%madrakekayāḥ / gajāśvarathapattyaughās%}

(12) During the night war, Yudhiṣṭhira
killed a large number of Madrakas
({%madrakāṇāṃ gaṇān yudhi%}) 7. 132. 25;
Arjuna did the same 7. 136. 5; (13) In
the summary narration of the first
fifteen days of war Saṃjaya mentioned
Madrakas among those who were killed
by Arjuna ({%mālavā madrakāś caiva%}) 8. 4.
46; (14) Dhṛtarāṣṭra remembered that
Karṇa had once defeated Madrakas
and made them pay tribute ({%ajaīṣīd...%}

Vaiṣṇavayāga (3. 241. 29, 32; 3. App. I.
24. 28-34); (15) On the sixteenth day,

of Kauravas ({%anupādas tu vāmas … %}
{%mahatyā senayā sārdhaṃ madradeśasamu-%}
{%tthayā //%}) 8. 7. 19, 14; on the same
day, elephant drivers drove Madra and
other warriors, skilled in fighting battles
while riding elephants; they showered
Dhṛṣṭadyumna with arrows, {%tomaras%} and
{%nārāca%} arrows; Dhṛṣṭadyumna pierced the
enemy elephants with arrows—each one
with ten, six or eight arrows; the Pāṇḍava
warriors succeeded in routing the attack of
the elephants ({%hastibhis tu mahāmātrās … %}

{%gajān%}) 8. 17. 28; (16) On the seventeenth
day, Duryodhana, protected by Madras and
Kekayas, followed Duḥśāsana, who was
at the back ({%vyūhasya pṛṣṭhataḥ%}) of the
Bārhaspatyavyūha of Kauravas 8. 31. 19,
21, 26; Duryodhana protected by Madra
{%mahārathas%} was guarding Karṇa from all
sides 8. 32. 19; angered Bhīma fought with
Madras along with Kurus and Kekayas;
he killed their chariot-fighters by thousands
along with their charioteers, horses, ele-
phants and foot-soldiers 8. 40. 69, 71-73;
(17) On the eighteenth day, when Śalya
was consecrated as the {%senāpati%} of Kaura-
vas, Madrakas were delighted and they
praised Śalya ({%hṛṣṭāś cāsan … madrakāś ca%}
{% … /tuṣṭuvuś caiva%}) 9. 6. 7; Śalya was at the
head of the Sarvatobhadravyūha ({%mukhaṃ%}
{%vyūhasya%}) along with Madraka heroes
({%madrakaiḥ sahito vīraiḥ%}) 9. 7. 23, 19;
(18) On the eighteenth day, Duryodhana
tried to check seven hundred chariot-fighters
of Madras who rushed forward from the
[Page825-b+ 40]
main army to continue to fight even after
the death of Śalya ({%madrarājapadānugāḥ /%}
{%rathāḥ sapta śatā vīrā niryayur mahato%}
{%balāt // na gantavyaṃ na gantavyam iti%}
{%madrān avārayat%}); though they were repea-
tedly asked to stop marching forward,
Madras entered the army of Pāṇḍavas to
kill Yudhiṣṭhira; intent on fighting ({%kṛta-%}
{%cittāḥ sma yodhane%}) they made twangs
from their bows and fought with Pāṇḍavas
9. 17. 1-4; Arjuna rushed to help Yudhi-
ṣṭhira who was oppressed by great Madra
chariot-fighters desirous of doing what
was dear to the king of Madras ({%dharma-%}
{%putraṃ ca pīḍitam / madrarājapriye yuktair%}
{%madrakāṇāṃ mahārathaiḥ //%}); encircled
by Pāṇḍavas, Madra heroes repeatedly
agitated their army ({%te samantāt parivṛtāḥ%}
{%pāṇḍavaiḥ puruṣarṣabhāḥ / kṣobhayanti%}
{%sma tāṃ senām... / ;akṣobhyata tadā%}
{%rājan pāṇḍūnāṃ dhvajinī puṇaḥ%}); fighting
whole-heartedly the Madra chariot-fighters
made their opponents tremble ({%tyaktā-%}
{%tmānaḥ … kampayanti sma%}) 9. 17. 5, 9-
11; they shouted loudly asking the where-
abouts of Yudhiṣṭhira and other Pāṇḍava
warriors; Draupadī's sons and Sātyaki
attacked them; Madras, with the wheels
of their chariots and flag-staffs broken,
were killed by Pāṇḍavas 9. 17. 12, 14-
15; when they again rushed at Pāṇḍavas,
Duryodhana tried to pacify them urging
them to return; but no one listened to him
9. 17. 16-17; Śakuni blamed Duryodhana
since Madras were being killed in the
very presence of Kaurava heroes; he
reminded him that Kurus and Madras
had decided to fight together ({%sahitair nāma%}
{%yoddhavyam ity eṣa samayaḥ kṛtaḥ%}) 9. 17.
17-20; when Duryodhana complained that
[Page826-a+ 40]
the Madra warriors did not listen to him
when he tried to check them, Śakuni told
him that angered fighters do not obey the
orders of their seniors; that was not the
time either to get angry with Madras or
neglect them ({%alaṃ kroddhuṃ tathalteṣāṃ%}
{%nāyaṃ kāla upekṣitum%}); he advised Duryo-
dhana collectively to go to save the great
(Madra) archers who were loyal to Śalya
({%paritrātuṃ maheṣvāsān madrarājapadānu-%}
{%gān%}) 9. 17. 21-24; accordingly Duryo-
dhana with his large army went to the
help of Madra warriors; Pāṇḍavas, seeing
Madra warriors fighting, attacked them;
in the battle that ensued Madras were
killed 9. 17. 25-28; the battle described
9. 17. 30-37; when Duryodhana's army
realized that the large army of Śalya was
being killed, they again turned away from
the scene of fight ({%tato hatam abhiprekṣya%}
{%madrarājabalaṃ mahat / duryodhanabalaṃ%}
{%sarvaṃ punar āsīt parāṅmukham%}) 9. 17. 38;
Śakuni told the energetic ({%tarasvinaḥ%})
Madra warriors to attack the vanguard
of the Pāṇḍava army and that he himself,
would take in the rear ({%yudhyadhvam%}
{%agrato yāvat pṛṣṭhato hanmi pāṇḍavān%});
they raised sound and attacked Pāṇḍavas
who showered arrows and killed the
army of Śalya; seeing that, Duryo-
dhana's army again turned away; Śakuni
again blamed them and pointed out that
the Madra army consisting of ten thousand
horses and fighting with bright lances had
fought heroically and brought about great
destruction of the enemies ({%anīkaṃ daśa-%}

{@F.@} Past event; Māndhātṛ once asked Indra
[Page826-b+ 40]
how kings like him could make Madrakas
who lived like Dasyus, follow religion and
how he could control them ({%kathaṃ dhar-%}
{%maṃ careyus te … /madvidhaiś ca kathaṃ%}

duties of Dasyus 12. 65. 13, 15, 17-22.
