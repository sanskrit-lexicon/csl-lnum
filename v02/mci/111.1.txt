{@Garuḍa@}¦, {@Garutmant, Tārkṣya, Vaina-@}
{@teya, Suparṇa@} m.: A mythical bird.
{@A.@} Origin: (a) According to 1. 2. 73
the origin is narrated in the Āstīkaparvan;
mind-born ({%saṃkalpaja%}) son of Kaśyapa and
Vinatā (1. 27. 27, hence often called Vaina-
teya; also Vinatātmaja, Vinatāsuta, Vinatā-
sūnu) 1. 14. 6, 8; 1. 27. 2, 27, 34; 1. 59. 39;
1. 60. 67; 5. 103. 10; born from one of the two
eggs of Vinatā placed in a warm pot ({%sopas-%}
{%veda bhāṇḍa%}) for over a thousand years; as
advised by her elder son Aruṇa, Vinatā did not
break the egg prematurely 1. 14. 12 14, 19-20;
when the proper time came Garuḍa came out
of the egg without mother's help 1. 20. 4; as
soon as born he left the mother and flew up
in the sky, from there to seek his destined
food (serpents, hence {%pannagasūdana%}) 1. 14.
22-23; as son of Vinatā, he is counted among
the six Vainateyas 1. 59. 39; 1. 114. 62;
(1. 60. 38); (b) Garuḍa born due to the
penance of the Vālakhilyas 1. 27. 27; once
Indra disregarded the Vālakhilyas; so they
offered a sacrifice to produce another Indra
for gods who would be a hundred times more
powerful than the then existing Indra 1. 27.
[Page015-b+ 41]
8-14; at the intervention of Kaśyapa Prajā-
pati, Vālakhilyas agreed to the proposal that
the one to be born as a result of their
sacrifice would be the ‘Indra’ of the birds 1.
27. 16, 20, 29; hence Garuḍa was consecrated
as Indra of birds 1. 27. 35; Rudra gave a
boon that the Vālakhilyas will produce by
their penance Suparṇa, the bringer of Soma
13. 14. 62-63; (c) At birth, Garuḍa
was of big size ({%mahākāyaḥ%}), having
blazing lustre and looking like a mass of
kindled fire 1. 20. 5, 7; all people thought
him to be fire; gods and sages requested Agni
not to burn the people; they were informed
by Agni that the mass of fire was Garuḍa,
Agni's equal in lustre 1. 20. 4-8; gods and
sages praised Garuḍa, whereupon Garuḍa with-
drew his lustre 1. 20. 10-14. {@B.@} Progeny:
Suparṇas: six sons of Garuḍa (Vainateya)
Sumukha (6. 7. 12) and others, extended the
lineage of Suparṇa; these live in the world of
Suparṇas with serpents as their food 5. 99. 1;
these six are thus the founders of the {%vinatā-%}
{%kula%} 5. 99. 3. {@C.@} Eminence: Garuḍa com-
pared with Pinākin 1. 28. 20; Upamanyu said
that Śiva was Vainateya among the birds 13.
14. 158; as the best among the birds he was
counted among the Vibhūtis of Bhagavān 6.
32. 30; Arjuna was like Garuḍa among the
birds 6. 116. 32; Vainateya never thought
highly of other birds whenever he con-
fronted them 6. 4. 34. {@D.@} Bringer of {%amṛta%}
(Soma): Some time after his birth Garuḍa
approached his mother who, as the slave of
Kadrū was on the other side of the ocean;
at her instance Vainateya carried on his
back serpents near the sun; serpents fainted
due to sun's (hot) rays 1. 21. 5-6; when
revived at Indra's intervention, Suparṇa
carried them to a beautiful forest in an island,
and from there to another island 1. 23. 1,
[Page016-a+ 41]
6-7; Garuḍa asked Vinatā why he must do
whatever serpents asked him to do; knowing
the reason (Vinatā's slavery), Garuḍa asked
serpents how his mother could be freed from
slavery; serpents asked him to get {%amṛta%} for
them (1. 23. 1-12); before starting on his
expedition, Garuḍa asked Vinatā what he
might eat on his way; she asked him to eat the
Niṣādas living in Niṣādālaya but warned him
never to harm a Brāhmaṇa; Vinatā told
Garuḍa how to recognize a Brāhmaṇa; at the
time of his departure he was blessed by
Vinatā; at Niṣādālaya he opened his beak
and ate up those that entered it 1. 24. 1-14;
a Brāhmaṇa and his wife inadvertently got
into his beak and burnt his throat; Garuḍa
opened the beak and let the Brāhmaṇa and his
wife, a Niṣādī, slip out, he was blessed by the
Brāhmaṇa 1. 25. 1-5; further on his way he
met his father Kaśyapa whom he told that he
was on his way to get Soma (1. 25. 7; {%amṛta%}
1. 25. 9) and asked what else he might
eat; Kaśyapa asked him to eat Supratīka,
(an elephant) and Vibhāvasu (a tortoise),
both of enormous size, and blessed him 1. 25.
7-9, 25; Garuda picked up the elephant and
the tortoise (who, according to 5. 107. 16, lived
in the south and used to fight with each other)
with his nails and went to Alambatīrtha and
sat on a Rohiṇa tree to eat the two; the branch
gave way under the tremendous weight 1. 25.
27-33; on this branch were the Vālakhilyas; to
save them from destruction Garuḍa (Tārkṣya
1. 26. 18) held the branch in his beak and flew
around; not finding a place to rest Garuḍa went
to his father Kaśyapa on the Gandhamādana
mountain; Kaśyapa told the Vālakhilyas
that Garuḍa's endeavour was in the interest
of the living beings; they left the branch;
Garuḍa (Vinatātmaja 1. 26. 15) asked
Kaśyapa to direct him to a place, free from
[Page016-b+ 41]
Brāhmaṇas, where he might leave the branch;
as advised, Garuḍa went to an uninhabited
mountain covered with snow and there ate the
elephant and the tortoise 1. 26. 1-16; as
Garuḍa drew near the place of {%amṛta,%}
there were bad omens for gods; when Indra
enquired the reason, Brahaspati told him that
Garuḍa was arriving to fetch Soma 1. 26.
36-37 (called also {%amṛta%} 1. 26. 38); Bṛhas-
pati told the gods that Garuḍa was of in-
comparable strength and would achieve what
was most difficult to achieve ({%asādhyam api%}
{%sādhayet%}) 1. 26. 37; Garuḍa (Garutmart
1. 28. 1; Vainateya 1. 28. 14; Vinatāsuta 1. 28.
20) fought with Bhauvana, the protector of
Soma (1. 28. 3), with other gods who were
protecting {%amṛta%} (1. 28. 6), an with birds
({%pakṣin%}) like Aśvakranda, Reṇuka and others;
he killed these, and put gods to flight; he fought
with wings, beak and nails 1. 28. 1-20; after
the fight Garuḍa saw {%amṛta%} surrounded
by fire; he divided his mouth into ninety
times ninety, fetched water in them from rivers,
poured it on the fire and pacified it; to enter
the fire he became small in size 1. 28.
22-25; near the {%amṛta%} he saw a wheel
of iron ({%ayasmaya%}), of sharp edge, which
was a device ({%yantra%}) created by gods to
cut down those who might try to steal
Soma; as he entered through the spokes
of the wheel he saw two serpents, with poi-
son in their eyes ({%cakṣurviṣau%}), guard-
ing {%amṛta;%} anyone seen by them would be
reduced to ashes; Suparṇa blinded their eyes
with dust and, unseen, he (Vainateya)
snatched Soma and flew away quickly; with
the force of his speed he uprooted ({%unmath-%})
the {%yantra%} 1. 29. 2-10; he himself did not
taste the {%amṛta%} but asked a boon from Viṣṇu
that he should become undecaying and im-
mortal without tasting {%amṛta%} 1. 29. 11, 14;
[Page017-a+ 41]
without going near him Indra struck Garuḍa,
as he was taking away {%amṛta,%} with his {%vajra;%}
to respect the sage (Dadhīca 1. 127. 12) from
whose bones the {%vajra%} was fashioned, the {%vajra%}
itself, and Indra, Garuḍa released a feather
from his wings, as though due to the stroke
of {%vajra,%} but otherwise was not affected
by the {%vajra%} 1. 29. 17-20; seeing the feather
of excellent form all beings ({%sarvabhūtāni%})
said “may this bird be Suparṇa” ({%surūpaṃ%}
{%patram ālakṣya suparṇo 'yaṃ bhavatv iti%})
1. 29. 21; Indra sought Garuḍa's friendship,
and Garuḍa agreed 1. 29. 23; 1. 30. 1
(Kaśyapa had prophesied before Garuḍa's
birth that he would be the helper of Indra 1.
27. 30); Indra requested Garuḍa to return
Soma, but Garuḍa told him the purpose of
taking it away; both hatched a plan—
Indra was to take away {%amṛta%} once Garuḍa
had placed it before the serpents and freed his
mother from slavery 1. 30. 7-9; Indra
granted Garuḍa a boon, and he chose ser-
pents to be his food 1. 30. 10-12 (hence his
epithets like {%pannagāśana%} 2. 22. 23; 5. 110.
5, 15; 5. 117. 23; {%pannagasūdana%} 1. 14.
22; {%bhujagendrāri%} 5. 110. 1; {%bhujagāri%} 10.
13. 4); Garuḍa brought {%amṛta%} to serpents and
placed it for them on the {%kuśa%} grass; he asked
them to take it after they had bathed and
become auspicious ({%maṅgalasaṃyuktāḥ%}); he
asked serpents to free his mother from slavery
from that day; the serpents agreed and went
to bathe; Garuḍa (Suparṇa) was happy to
roam with his mother Vinatā freely in the for-
est and to gladden her 1. 30. 14-21 (Aruṇa,
Garuḍa's elder brother, had prophesied that
Garuḍa would free Vinatā from slavery 1.
14. 18); {%phalaśruti:%} One who hears or recites
this narrative ({%kathā%}) will go to heaven due
to his glorifying Garuḍa, the lord of the birds
({%patagapati%}) 1. 30. 22. {@E.@} Gālava epi-
[Page017-b+ 41]
sode: Gālava was asked by his teacher Viśvā-
mitra to give him as {%dakṣiṇā%} eight hundred
moon-like white horses, each having a black ear
on one side (5. 104. 26); not knowing how to
procure these, Gālava desired to take recourse
to Viṣṇu; just then Garuḍa (Vinatātmaja),
the friend of Gālava, appeared before him and
offered to take him to any place 5. 105.
14-19; Suparṇa described to Gālava the four
directions 5. Adh. 106-109; he told Gālava
the etymology of the name of the direction
{%uttarā%} ({%yasmād uttāryate pāpāt%} ‘because one
is freed there from sin’ 5. 109. 1; also {%guṇair%}
{%anyair dig uttarā%} ‘a direction superior (to
others) in different qualities’, and {%sarva-%}
{%karmasu cottarā%} ‘better (than other direc-
tions) for performing all rites’ 5. 109. 24);
Gālava requested Garuḍa (named variously
as Garutmant, Suparṇa, Vinatātmaja,
Tārkṣya, Aruṇānuja) to take him to the east;
Garuḍa (Vinatāsūnu) agreed and asked
Galava to mount him 5. 110. 1-4; unable to
stand the speed of Garuḍa, Gālava requested
him (Vinatātmaja) not to proceed further
but to return to their place 5. 110. 14-15;
Gālava told Garuḍa that his real purpose was
to obtain the eight hundred horses and since
he knew no way to obtain them he thought of
giving up his life that way 5. 110. 16-17;
Garuḍa (Vinatātmaja) found fault with
Gālava for wanting to end his life and told
him: “The time of death is not determined
by any person, Kāla is rather supreme ({%na%}
{%cāpi kṛtrimaḥ kālaḥ kālo hi parameśvaraḥ%}
[Nīla.: {%kṛtrimaḥ svecchāsampādyaḥ%} 5. 112.
20 Bom. Ed.]) 5. 110. 19-20; he told Gālava
that they would first repair to mountain Ṛṣabha
in the heart of the ocean, eat, rest, and then
return 5. 110. 22; on the peak of the Ṛṣabha
mountain Suparṇa and Gālava met a Brāh-
maṇī Śāṇḍilī; they ate the food cooked by her
[Page018-a+ 41]
and slept; when Suparṇa woke up he found
himself to be just a ball of meat, bereft of
wings, with only mouth and feet left; he was re-
duced to that state because he belittled Śāṇḍilī
and had planned to take her away from that
place; he begged for forgiveness; Śāṇḍilī
relented and told Garuḍa that he would
be ‘Suparṇa’ again; Garuḍa got back his
wings which were stronger than before (Nīla.
{%draviṇavattarau = balavattarau%} 5. 113. 17
Bom. Ed.) 5. 111. 17; Śāṇḍilī advised Garuḍa
not to despise women at any time even if they
deserved to be despised ({%na ca te garhaṇīyāpi%}
{%garhaṇīyāḥ striyaḥ kvacit%} 5. 111. 16) 5. 111.
1-17; when Viśvāmitra, on his way, saw
Gālava without the horses he had asked for,
he blamed him in the presence of Vainateya
and said he would further wait for a period
of the same duration as before; Suparṇa,
having heard what Viśvāmitra had said,
explained to Gālava the importance of gold
and wealth (he told him the etymology of the
word {%dhana: dhatte dhārayate cedam etasmāt%}
{%kāraṇād dhanam%} 5. 112. 2) and took him to
his friend, king Yayāti, for getting wealth to
purchase the required horses; when they met
Yayāti, Garuḍa ({%vinatāsuta%}) requested him
on Gālava's behalf to part with some wealth;
Garuḍa assured Yayāti that Gālava in return
would give him a part of his {%tapas;%} Garuḍa
told Yayāti that since he was qualified to
give a gift and Gālava to receive it his
giving gift to Gālava would be like pouring
milk in a conch shell ({%śaṅkhe kṣīram ivā-%}
{%saktam%} 5. 112. 20) 5. 111. 18-23; 5. 112.
1-20; Yayāti listened to what Suparṇa had
said; he was delighted to meet Tārkṣya, his
friend; but Yayāti told him that he was no
longer wealthy; however as it was not meet to
frustrate the hopes of a {%viprarṣi,%} he was pre-
pared to part with his daughter Mādhavī by
[Page018-b+ 41]
marrying whom to some king Gālava could
acquire wealth as bride price ({%śulka%}) to buy
the horses; Garuḍa having shown the way to
Gālava to acquire the horses left him and
went to his residence 5. 113. 1-16; when
Gālava had procured six hundred out of the
eight hundred required {%śyāmakarṇa%} horses, he
met Garuḍa (Vinatātmaja) again 5. 116. 21;
Garuḍa (Vainateya) heard Gālava's story;
he (Suparṇa) told Gālava that he would never
find more than six hundred horses as, before
him, Ṛcīka did not get more than six hundred
horses; Garuḍa advised Gālava to give
Mādhavī to Viśvāmitra in lieu of the remain-
ing two hundred horses; Suparṇa then took
Gālava, Mādhavī and the six hundred horses
to Viśvāmitra; Gālava was thus able to pay
the {%dakṣiṇā%} his teacher had demanded with the
help of Suparṇa; Gālava permitted Suparṇa to
leave 5. 117. 1-23. {@F.@} Sumukha (a serpent)
episode: Serpent Āryaka told Mātali who
wanted his daughter to be married to Sumukha
that Cikura, his son, was killed by Vainateya
and that the same fate awaited his grand-son
Sumukha in a month's time; Mātali assured
Āryaka that he would endeavour to mitigate
the threat of Suparṇa to Sumukha; when
they all approached Indra, Viṣṇu asked
Indra to give {%amṛta%} to Sumukha and make
him immortal; Indra, remembering the pro-
wess of Vainateya, was reluctant to part
with {%amṛta%} and asked Viṣṇu himself to give
it to Sumukha; when asked by Viṣṇu again,
Indra gave only long life to Cikura
but not {%amṛta%} 5. 102. 14-27; 5. 101. 24.
{@G.@} Association with Viṣṇu: (1) As
standing on his flag-staff and as his vehicle:
While fetching {%amṛta%} from heaven, Vaina-
teya met Viṣṇu on way; when offered a boon
by Viṣṇu, Garuḍa chose that he should stay
above Viṣṇu ({%tava tiṣṭheyam upari%}); when
[Page019-a+ 41]
Garuḍa in return offered a boon to Viṣṇu,
he chose Garuḍa to serve him as his vehicle
({%vāhana%}), and since Garuḍa wanted to stand
above him Viṣṇu asked Garuḍa to stand on his
flag-staff ({%dhvajaṃ ca cakre%}) 1. 29. 12-16;
hence after the death of Jarāsandha when
Kṛṣṇa thought of Garuḍa (Garutmant), he
instantly appeared and took his seat on (the
flag-staff of) the chariot; the flag-staff then
appeared as a raised {%caitya%} post 2. 22. 22-
23; Kṛṣṇa's flag marked with Garuḍa when
he started for Hāstinapura 5. 81. 20; when
Dāruka brought Kṛṣṇa's chariot for the use of
Sātyaki it was marked with Suparṇa 7. 122.
43; also 7. 56. 33 (Vainateya); when Kṛṣṇa
got his chariot ready to pursue Aśvatthāman,
Vainateya stood on the flag-staff 10. 13. 4;
when, at the end, the Vṛṣṇis were helplessly
looking on, Suparṇa on the flag of Kṛṣṇa was
taken away day and night by the Apsaras 16.
4. 5; Kṛṣṇa (Viṣṇu) is called {%Garuḍadhvaja%}
7. 57. 2; 13. 11. 5; 13. 135. 51; {%Suparṇa-%}
{%ketu%} 3. 173. 15; {%Tārkṣyaketana%} 2. 2. 12;
12. 48. 14; {%Tārkṣyapravaraketana%} 2. 42.
55; {%Tārkṣyadhvaja%} 8. 27. 65; (also cf. 12.
46. 34); {%Tārkṣyalakṣaṇa%} 12. 43. 8; Kṛṣṇa
used Vainateya as his vehicle while fetching
Pārijāta from Amarāvatī 7. 10. 22; he used
Tārkṣya as vehicle while going to Himavant
to propitiate Śiva 13. 14. 26 and Vainateya
while waiting on him 13. 14. 142; Garuḍa
felt he was disregarded by Indra because he
stood on the flag of Indra's younger brother
and because he carried him (Kṛṣṇa) on his
back and was thus reduced to the state of a
servant 5. 103. 13, 8; Viṣṇu asked Garutmant
to bring king Vasu Uparicara from Pātāla
and make him a {%khecara%} 12. 324. 30-35;
(2) Removal of Garuḍa's pride: When
Garuḍa knew that Indra had granted long life
to the serpent Sumukha he blamed Indra for
[Page019-b+ 41]
depriving him of his food; he threatened to
give up his life and said that as long as Indra
was there he had nothing to do with Viṣṇu
({%na viṣṇuḥ kāraṇaṃ mama%}) 5. 103. 1-17;
Viṣṇu scolded Garuḍa (Tārkṣya, Garutmant)
for praising himself although in reality he was
very weak; Viṣṇu told Garuḍa that he did not
really carry Viṣṇu but Viṣṇu carried himself
and also Garuḍa ({%aham evātmanātmānaṃ%}
{%vahāmi tvāṃ ca dhāraye%} 5. 103. 20); how-
ever he asked Garuḍa to carry only his right
arm, and when the arm was placed on Garuḍa
he fell down under its weight and became
almost unconscious ({%vicetāḥ%}); he shed many
feathers; Viṣṇu did not deprive him of his
life; finally Garuḍa bowed down to Viṣṇu
and begged for forgiveness 5. 103. 18-30.
{@H.@} Association with Śeṣa: Śeṣa complained
to Pitāmaha that his dull-witted brothers
(serpents) hated their brother (cousin) Vai-
nateya and he in turn hated them 1. 32.
10-11; Pitāmaha then made Garuḍa
(Suparṇa, Vainateya) a friend of Śeṣa 1. 32.
25. {@I.@} Association with Skanda: Suparṇa
gave Skanda a feather and a peacock as toy
({%krīḍanīya%}) 13. 86. 20-21; he gave peacock
to Skanda 9. 45. 46; he attended Skanda's
consecration as general of the army 9. 44.
14; some of the warriors of Skanda were
Garuḍa-faced ({%garuḍānanāḥ%}) 9. 44. 79.
{@J.@} Garuḍa's other feats: (1) Suparṇa
swallowed a quail which, however, was
freed by Aśvinau 1. 3. 62; (2) Garut-
mant often went to the mountain Himavant
12. 314. 6; Suparṇa once carried away
forcibly the big snake Ṛddhimant living
near a lake on the Gandhamādana mountain;
the wonderful feat ({%adbhutam%}) was witnessed
by the Pāṇḍavas 3. 157. 14-15; (3) A ser-
pent (not named), husband of the daughter
of Airāvata, killed by Suparṇa 6. 86. 7;
[Page020-a+ 41]
(4) Suparṇa (and Suparṇas) fought with
Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna who protected the fire at
Khāṇḍava; he fought with wings, beak, and
nails 1. 218. 19-20; 8. 63. 68 ({%nakha, daśana%}
(? for beak); (5) During his fight with
demons (Daiteyas) he performed the great
feat of killing six of them 5. 103. 11-12.
{@K.@} Strength: Indra described Garuḍa
as a great being ({%mahad bhūtam%}) and
wished to know the extent of his strength
(1. 29. 22, 23); Garuḍa said that although
good persons did not themselves describe
their strength and virtues he would do so due
to his friendship with Indra; Garuḍa could
carry the whole earth with mountains etc.,
the worlds, even with Śakra, with only a
quill of his feather ({%pakṣanāḍī%}), and this
without feeling fatigue 1. 30. 2-5; also cf.
1. 20. 10-14; 1. 26. 6-9; 5. 103. 10-11, 17.
{@L.@} Greatness: (1) Called {%mahātman%} 1.
28. 24; (2) Destined to be the only Indra
of all birds and was so consecrated 1. 27. 29,
35; hence he is called {%khageśvara%} 1. 20. 14;
{%khagarāj%} 9. 16. 57; {%pakṣirāj%} 1. 24. 12; 1.

{%dvijottama%} 12. 324. 30-32; (3) Vainateya is
counted among the Ādityas 1. 60. 38; (4) he
moved at will ({%kāmacārī, kāmagamaḥ%})
and had any amount of strength according
to his wish ({%kāmavīrya%}); he was irresistible
({%adhṛṣya%}) and could not be killed ({%avadhya%})
1. 21. 1; 1. 27. 2, 3, 29; (5) Vainateya
present among those who greeted Arjuna's
birth 1. 114. 62; (6) The account of
[Page020-b+ 41]
Garuḍa is the subject matter of a Purāṇa
1. 27. 4, 3. {@M.@} Comparisons with Garuḍa:
(1) Based on his enmity with serpents:
