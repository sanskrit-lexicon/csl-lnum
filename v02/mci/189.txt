6 Bom. Ed.); by nature, pure like water
({%?prakṛtyā nityasalilaḥ%} on which Nī.

355. 9 Bom. Ed.). {@E.@} Epithets: As

16, and {%anilāśana%} ‘who lives on air’ 12. 348.
5. {@F.@} Status: Chief among the serpents
({%bhujagendra%} 12. 344. 10; {%nāgendra%} 12. 347.
7, 15; 12. 349. 2), the best among the ser-
pents ({%uttamanāga%} 12. 345. 6; {%bhujagattama%}
12. 347. 15; {%bhujagasattama%} 12. 352. 2;
{%uragaśreṣṭha%} 12. 353. 1; {%dvijaśreṣṭha%} 12.
349. 5); king of serpents ({%pannagapati%} 12.
349. 1; {%bhogapati%} 12. 352. 9; {%bhujagapati%}
12. 353. 9). {@G.@} Wife and Relatives:
His wife, not named ({%nāgapatnī%} 12. 345. 4,
{%nāgī%} 12. 345. 13), virtuous and devoted;
she knew what the duties of a student and a
servant were, was familiar with the duties of
the four {%varṇas,%} and knew the duties of a
householder and his wife; she had learnt these
from her husband Padma; she therefore made
no mistake in receiving the guests during the
absence of her husband; on a certain occasion
she duly received and honoured a Brāhmaṇa
who arrived at Padma's residence 12. 345. 4-
12; when Padma arrived she informed him
about the arrival of a Brāhmaṇa who wanted
to meet him and had taken his residence on
the river Gomatī; she advised Padma to see
the Brāhmaṇa 12. 347. 13-16; Padma's sense
of pride was hurt since he was commanded
by a Brāhmaṇa to go and meet him; he there-
fore asked his wife whether the Brāhmaṇa was
really a human being or a god in disguise 12.
348. 1-2; his wife told him that she did not
consider the Brāhmaṇa to be a god (in dis-
guise); she advised her husband to give up his
[Page036-a+ 41]
inborn anger ({%tad roṣaṃ sahajaṃ tyaktvā%}
12. 348. 8) and go and meet the Brāhmaṇa
12. 348. 5-8; Padma realized that he was
too proud, that being the fault of his species
({%jātidoṣa%} 12. 348. 13), and was happy that
his wife had burnt his anger by her admoni-
tion ({%dagdho vācāgninā tvayā%} 12. 348. 13);
he felt himself praiseworthy to have such a
virtuous wife 12. 348. 13-14, 18-19; during
Padma's absence his relatives—brothers,
sons and wife—had gone to the river Gomatī
to persuade the Brāhmaṇa who almost
starved himself to take some food but he did
not; they returned home without achieving
their purpose 12. 346. 1-13. {@H.@} Padma's
functions: It was his duty to pull by
rotation the sun's one-wheeled chariot for
a month (in a year ?) ({%sūryarathaṃ voḍhuṃ%}
{%gato'sau māsacārikaḥ%} 12. 345. 8; {%vivasvato%}
{%gacchati paryayeṇa voḍhuṃ bhavāṃs taṃ%}
{%ratham ekacakram%} 12. 350. 1). {@I.@} Padma
and the Brāhmaṇa Dharmāraṇya (12. 349.
5): Padma returned home after he had
performed his duty of drawing the Sun's cha-
riot and was permitted by the god to leave;
he was then informed by his wife about
the arrival of a Brāhmaṇa; she informed
Padma that the Brāhmaṇa had asked him to
meet him; Padma's initial reaction, due
to his sense of pride, was not to oblige the
Brāhmaṇa; but on the advice of his wife he
relented and met the Brāhmaṇa; he then told
his wife that he realized that it was not in
one's interest to get angry for in bygone days,
Rāvaṇa, Kārtavīrya and his sons were killed
due to their anger 12. 348. 13-17; he appro-
ached the Brāhmaṇa Dharmāraṇya and asked
him what he wanted 12. 349. 3-4, 9-12; the
Brāhmaṇa first asked Padma a question; after
hearing Padma's answer, the Brāhmaṇa would
tell Padma the purpose of his visit 12. 349.
[Page036-b+ 41]
16; the Brāhmaṇa asked Padma to tell him if
while pulling the god Sun's chariot. he saw
anything wonderful on his way 12. 350. 1;
Padma first told the Brāhmaṇa that there was
nothing more wonderful than the Sun himself
(accomplished sages and deities resort to his
rays; wind resorts to sun's rays and flows
from there to fill the sky; rain water is released
by his dark foot (ray ?), Śukra by name,
({%śukro nāmāsitaḥ pādo yasya vāridharo%}
{%'mbare / toyaṃ sṛjati varṣāsu%} 12. 350. 4);
Sun takes back the rain water with his shining
ray during eight months; the soul ({%ātmā%}) is
for all times established in his lustre; he is the
seed of everything, movable and immovable
and the earth is sustained by him; the long-
armed, eternal, unalterable god having no
beginning and no end resides in the sun 12.
350. 2-7); Padma next told him that one day
something unusual happened: while the Sun
was shining brightly at mid-day, there
suddenly appeared light in all directions, light
similar to that of the sun; then, as if tearing
open the sky a being, looking like a second Sun
({%dvitīya iva bhāskaraḥ%} 12. 350. 11), appro-
ached the Sun; the Sun held out his hand to
receive him and the other being also extended
his right hand to hold the Sun's hand; then
the being entered the Sun's disc 12. 350. 8-15;
confused as to who was the real Sun—the one
in the chariot or the one that arrived from the
sky—Padma and others asked the Sun to
explain; the Sun told them that the one who
entered him was a sage who observed the vow
of {%uñchavṛtti%} (living only on grains fallen in
the field); the sage also lived successively on
fruit, roots, fallen leaves, water and air and
recited the {%ṛc%} stanzas; that Brāhmaṇa (sage)
even now moved round the earth with the Sun
—this was the wonder seen by Padma 12. 351.
1-6; the Brāhmaṇa Dharmāraṇya, on hearing
[Page037-a+ 39]
Padma's account, took leave of him without
telling him the purpose of his visit; to the
perplexed Padma, Dharmāraṇya explained
that he was only curious to know what led to
the accumulation of merit ({%puṇyasaṃcaya%});
now that he knew how one did it, he had
decided to observe {%uñchavrata;%} the purpose
of his visit was served ({%kṛtārtho 'smi%}) and
hence he was leaving 12. 352. 1-10.
