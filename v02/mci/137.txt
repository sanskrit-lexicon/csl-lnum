{@Takṣaka@}¦ m.: A mythical serpent.
{@A.@} Birth and family: One of the sons
(very likely the fourth son) of Kadrū (and
Kaśyapa), hence called {%kādraveya%} 1. 31. 5,
2; 1. 59. 40 (placed third); 1. 3. 144; his
youngest brother ({%jaghanyaja%}) was Śrutasena
1. 3. 146; his son Aśvasena (1. 218. 5) was
his constant companion 1. 3. 145; (by {%takṣaka-%}
{%putra%} 8. 65. 39 Aśvasena is probably alluded
to); his daughter Jvālā married to Ṛkṣa born
in the line of Pūru 1. 90. 24; serpents belong-
ing to his {%kula,%} Pucchaṇḍaka and others, listed
by Sūta among those offered in the snake
sacrifice of Janamejaya 1. 52. 7-9; Takṣaka
also named among the serpent-sons of Surasā
and Kaśyapa 5. 101. 9, 4, 17. {@B.@} Residence:
Lived in Bhogavatī Purī in the southern direc-
tion; he, with Vāsuki, protected it 5. 107. 19;
5. 101. 9; he had his abode ({%niveśana%}) also in
the Khāṇḍava forest where Asura Maya happ-
ened to stay at the time of the great fire 1.
215. 7; 1. 219. 35; Uttaṅka, in his praise of
the {%nāgas,%} referred to Takṣaka as living in
Khāṇḍava near Kurukṣetra, along the river
Ikṣumatī 1. 3. 142-146. {@C.@} Status: Second
only to Vāsuki according to an enumeration
based on eminence ({%yathāśreṣṭhān%}) 5. 101. 8;
called the king of the serpents {%nāgarāja%} 1. 3.
119, 120, 166; {%sarparāja%} 1. 218. 4; chief of
serpents {%nāgendra%} 1. 38. 34; 1. 39. 3; {%panna-%}
{%gendra%} 1. 38. 33, 35 etc.; best among ser-
pents {%pannagottama%} 1. 37. 13, 19, etc.; {%bhu-%}
{%jagottama%} 1. 48. 15, 18; {%pannagaśreṣṭha%} 1.
38. 32, 36; 1. 40. 3; {%uragasattama%} 1. 39. 16;
however Uttaṅka called Takṣaka {%pannagā-%}
{%dhama%} 1. 3. 188. {@D.@} Description: He
was of blazing lustre ({%tigmatejas%}), his poison
acted like fire and burnt the being he bit
[Page026-b+ 41]
({%āśīviṣa%}) 1. 37. 13; lotus-coloured ({%padma-%}
{%varcas%}) 1. 40. 3; he was called by Uttaṅka
and Janamejaya ‘evil-minded’ ({%durātman%} 1.
46. 36, 40; {%duṣṭāntarātman%} 1. 3. 185, 187),
and by Janamejaya ‘sinful’ ({%pāpa%}) 1. 46. 37.
{@E.@} Khāṇḍava incident: Since Takṣaka lived
in the Khāṇḍava forest, whenever god Fire
tried to burn it, Indra, being Takṣaka's
friend, he immediately extinguished the fire
1. 215. 7; when the forest was finally on
fire, Takṣaka was not in Khāṇḍava but
was safe at Kurukṣetra 1. 218. 4; Indra
was informed of this by an invisible
voice 1. 219. 12-13. {@F.@} Takṣaka and the
{%kuṇḍalas:%} Uttaṅka informed by Pauṣyaś
wife ({%kṣatriyā%}) while handing over her ear-
rings to him that Takṣaka coveted them;
Uttaṅka assured her that Takṣaka would not
be able to attack him 1. 3. 119-120; Tak-
ṣaka assumed the form of a naked mendi-
cant ({%nagna śramaṇa%}) and followed Uttaṅka
on way; he took the {%kuṇḍalas,%} placed by
Uttaṅka on the ground, and ran away; when
caught by Uttaṅka, Takṣaka assumed his
original form and suddenly entered a big hole;
on reaching {%nāgaloka%} he entered his residence
({%svabhavana%}); Uttaṅka went behind him
1. 3. 136-138; when the {%nāgaloka%} was filled
with smoke issuing from the anus of a horse
(really god Agni) the confused Takṣaka,
frightened by the heat of fire, returned the
{%kuṇḍalas%} to Uttaṅka 1. 3. 158-159; when
asked by the teacher the cause for delay in
getting the {%kuṇḍalas,%} Uttaṅka told him the
hindrance caused by Takṣaka 1. 3. 165-166;
angered by this incident Uttaṅka started for
Hāstinapura to take revenge on Takṣaka
1. 3. 177. {@G.@} Death of Parikṣit: Due to
the curse pronounced by Śṛṅgin king Parikṣit
was destined to die within a week due to
the burning lustre of the eminent serpent
[Page027-a+ 41]
Takṣaka 1. 37. 13-14, 19; 1. 46. 8-10;
Śṛṅgin's father informed Parikṣit about
his impending death at the hands of Takṣaka
1. 38. 19; 1. 46. 12-13; Kāśyapa, an eminent
sage ({%munipuṃgava%} 1. 38. 35), who knew the
cure for serpent bites started for Hāstinapura
to save Parikṣit from Takṣaka and acquire
wealth 1. 38. 31-33; Takṣaka, in disguise of
an aged Brāhmaṇa, met Kāśyapa on way and
asked him the reason for his hurrying on the
way; Kāśyapa told Takṣaka that he wanted
to cure Parikṣit when he would be burnt by
the fire of Taṣaka's lustre ({%tejasā 'dya%}
{%pradhakṣyati%}); then Takṣaka revealed his
identity and told Kāśyapa that he would not
be able to save Parikṣit from Takṣaka's bite;
Kāśyapa retorted that he was confident about
the strength of his science ({%vidyābala%}) 1. 38.
34-39; 1. 46. 15-17; Takṣaka challenged
Kāśyapa to bring back to life a {%nyagrodha%}
bitten and burnt by him; this was done by
Kāśyapa by his {%vidyābala%} 1. 39. 1-10;
astonished, Takṣaka promised to give Kāśyapa
all the wealth he desired from Parikṣit, and
even more, and begged him to return; he also
told Kaśyapa that the curse of the sage was
bound to come true, and if Kāśyapa was not
able to save Parikṣit he would lose his reputa-
tion; having received from Takṣaka the wealth
he wanted Kāśyapa turned back 1. 39. 11-19;
1. 46. 18-21; Takṣaka then started for Hās-
tinapura; on way he learnt about the arrange-
ments made to save Parikṣit with the help of
{%mantras%} and medicines which worked as cures
for poison ({%mantrāgadair viṣaharaiḥ%} 1. 39.
21); Takṣaka planned to deceive Parikṣit with
some trick ({%māyāyoga%}) and sent to the king
serpents in the disguise of hermits with fruits,
leaves, and water; when the seventh day since
the curse was uttered was about to end Pari-
kṣit felt himself secure; he found a small
[Page027-b+ 41]
worm in the fruit held by him and said (in
joke): “may this small worm turn into
Takṣaka and bite me” ({%kṛmiko māṃ daśatv%}
{%ayam takṣako nāma bhūtvā vai%} 1. 39.
31) and put it on his neck; immediately
Takṣaka coiled around the king with his body
({%bhoga%}) 1. 39. 22-33; the ministers of the
king cried and fled; they saw a wonderful
({%adbhuta%}) serpent rising up in the sky 1. 40.
1-3; the whole house was on fire due to the
heat of the serpent's poison; Parikṣit died due
to the fire ({%tejas%}) of Takṣaka's poison 1. 40.
4-5; ({%chadmenopetya takṣakaḥ … dagdhavān%}
{%viṣavahninā%} 1. 46. 22-23). {@H.@} Snake-
sacrifice: Uttaṅka, embittered by Tak-
ṣaka due to the obstacle put by him in
Uttaṅka's way, reported to Janamejaya how
Takṣaka was responsible for his father's
death, and instigated him to burn Takṣaka
in the fire of a {%sarpasatra%} 1. 3. 177-190;
when Janamejaya enquired with his mini-
sters they told him how his father was killed
by Takṣaka (1. 45. 19-28; 1. 46. 1-25);
Janamejaya again asked them how they could
know the conversation between the Panna-
gendra (i. e. Takṣaka) and Kāśyapa when,
apparently, it took place in a secluded place
in the forest; if satisfied with their expla-
nation he would think of the means to kill
the serpents ({%vidhāsyāmi pannagāntakarīṃ%}
{%matim%}) 1. 46. 26-27; the ministers reported
that a man happened to mount the tree
before it was burnt by Takṣaka; this man
had heard the dialogue between Takṣaka and
Kāśyapa; the man too was burnt with the tree;
when brought back to life along with the
tree the man returned to the town and
reported the incident to others 1. 46. 28-31;
Janamejaya, satisfied with this account,
decided to avenge the death of his father by
killing serpents for it was the evil-minded
[Page028-a+ 41]
Takṣaka who had offered wealth to Kāśyapa
and persuaded him not to go to Hāstina-
pura 1. 46. 35-41; Janamejaya wished to
know from his house-priest if there was any
rite by which he could get Takṣaka and his
relatives in the kindled fire; just as Takṣaka
had burnt Parikṣit by the fire of his poison
({%viṣāgni%}), so too Janamejaya wished to burn
the serpent; priests informed Janamejaya about
a rite known as {%sarpasatra,%} not performed by
any one before; thereupon Janamejaya con-
sidered Takṣaka as good as burnt in the sacri-
ficial fire 1. 47. 3-8; Takṣaka having come
to know of the {%sarpasatra%} went to Indra and
sought his shelter; Indra had already propitia-
ted Pitāmaha on Takṣaka's behalf and there-
fore assured Takṣaka that there was no danger
to his life from the fire of {%sarpasatra;%}
Takṣaka then lived happily in Indra's dwelling
1. 48. 14-18; in the meantime when the snake
sacrifice was in progress Āstīka appeared at
the place of sacrifice where serpents were
falling in the fire in large numbers; he praised
king Janamejaya; pleased, Janamejaya desired
to offer a boon to Āstīka and asked permis-
sion of the officiating priests; they gave the
permission since Takṣaka was to arrive soon;
but the {%hotṛ%} priest told Janamejaya that
Takṣaka was not showing; Janamejaya asked
the priests to spare no pains and get Takṣaka
quickly; the priests told the king that as the
Śāstras informed them and as the Fire narrat-
ed to them Takṣaka, out of fear, had taken
shelter with Indra 1. 51. 1-5 ({%yathā śāstrāṇi%}
{%naḥ prāhur yathā śaṃsati pāvakaḥ / indrasya%}
{%bhavane rājaṃs takṣako bhayapīḍitaḥ%}); the
king's bard Lohitākṣa, who knew what had
transpired ({%paurāṇiko veditavān purastāt%}
1. 51. 6), confirmed what the priests had told
the king; he said that Indra had asked
Takṣaka to stay with him and feel free from
[Page028-b+ 41]
any danger from fire; Janamejaya urged his
{%hotṛ%} priest to proceed and the priest with his
{%mantras%} called Indra himself; Indra appeared
on the scene with the serpent tucked to his
{%uttarīya;%} Janamejaya asked the priests to make
Takṣaka fall in the fire with Indra if he sought
shelter in Indra's residence; priests told Jana-
mejaya, as they heard a thunderous roar, that
Takṣaka was coming under the king's control,
they were sure that the serpent was dropped
down by Indra and was falling from his lap,
the serpent's body was loosened by the
{%mantras (mantravisrastakāyaḥ%} 1. 51. 13)
and he had lost consciousness; they permitted
Janamejaya to grant a boon to Āstīka since
the rite was progressing according to the pres-
cription and as Takṣaka was about to fall
into the fire; Āstīka chose the boon: “let
this sacrificial session come to an end, and
let no more serpents fall (into the fire)”
({%satraṃ te viramatv etan na pateyur ihora-%}
{%gāḥ%} 1. 51. 17); in vain did Janamejaya try
to persuade Āstīka to choose another boon;
Janamejaya agreed to stop the session and
granted freedom from risk to serpents 1.
51. 6-23; 1. 53. 8; Āstīka admitted that
Takṣaka was somehow saved because Jana-
mejaya followed the path of truth (and kept
his word) ({%kathaṃcit takṣako muktaḥ satya-%}
{%tvāt tava pārthiva%}) 15. 43. 14; Sūta called
it a great miracle of Āstīka that when Tak-
ṣaka slipped from Indra's hand, he remained
in the sky and did not drop down in the fire;
on Śaunaka's query whether Takṣaka's not
falling down from the mid-region was due to
the fact that the (suitable) {%mantras%}
did not reveal themselves to the priests
({%mantragrāmo manīṣiṇām na pratyabhāt%}
1. 53. 4), Sūta replied that that happened
because Āstīka thrice said to the serpent
‘stay’ ({%tiṣṭha%}) 1. 53. 1-6, and Takṣaka
[Page029-a+ 39]
stayed. {@I. Upamāna:@} Bhīṣma with his sharp
weapons compared with the big serpent
Takṣaka having excess of poison ({%viṣolbaṇa%})
6. 103. 15; a bow picked up by Aśvatthāman
had the lustre of the body of Takṣaka 8.
57. 60. {@J.@} Functions and Events: (1)
mentioned among the {%nāgas%} who, without
feeling fatigue, wait on Varuṇa in his {%sabhā;%}
described as marked with banner ({%patākin%}),
round spots ({%maṇḍalin%}), and hooded ({%phaṇa-%}
{%vant%}) 2. 9. 8, 10; (2) he was among those
who received the white snake issuing from the
mouth of Balarāma and entering the ocean
16. 5. 14, 12; (3) he was on the side of
Arjuna when celestial beings in the sky took
sides between Karṇa and Arjuna 8. 63. 36;
(4) Ghaṭotkaca and Alaṃbala assumed the
shape of Garuḍa and Takṣaka while fighting
with each other 7. 149. 26.
