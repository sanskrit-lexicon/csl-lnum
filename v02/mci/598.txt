demon Muru, killed him, then conquered the
demon Naraka, son of Bhūmi ({%bhauma%}),
and brought back with him the jewelled
{%kuṇḍalas,%} sixteen thousand excellent women

the army of the enemy ({%parasenābhayāvaha%})
5. 155. 6. {@C.@} Association with Kṛṣṇa: As
Kṛṣṇa's bow, it is mentioned among the
weapons placed on his chariot when he started
from the Khāṇḍavaprastha to Dvārakā 2. 2.
12; Kṛṣṇa asked his charioteer Dāruka to
place the bow (not named) in his chariot
when it was to be made ready for Kṛṣṇa's
eventual intervention in the war 7. 56. 32;
Śārṅga bow, along with conch, disc, mace and
Śakti appeared on Kṛṣṇa's different arms
when he manifested his fierce form, as a great
wonder, in the Sabhā of the Kauravas 5. 129.
9-10; Kṛṣṇa (and Viṣṇu) have epithets like
{%śārṅgadhanvan%} 3. 120. 6; 3. 189. 30; 5. 73.
2; 5. 135. 30; 6. 61. 35; 7. 9. 71; 8. 5. 16
({%śārṅga° °dhanvan%}); 10. 13. 6, 9; 12. 200.

{%dhanurdhara%} 6. 61. 45; {%śārṅgarathāṅgapāṇi%}
6. 55. 94; {%śārṅgagadādhara%} 2. 41. 33;

{%śārṅgacakrāsipāṇi%} 12. 43. 16. {@D.@} Use:
Kṛṣṇa used it in his fight with Śālva;
Kṛṣṇa's arrows released from Śārṅga first
failed to reach the Saubhapura of Śālva 3.
21. 18; he again released {%ayutas%} of arrows
against Śālva from his heavenly bow 3. 21.
24; the arrows released from Śārṅga pierced
the bodies of the demons in the Saubhapura
and they fell down in the ocean 3. 21. 28;
due to the {%māyā%} of Śālva, Kṛṣṇa saw the
son of Śūra (Vasudeva) falling down from
the Saubha; as a result, he was confused and
the Śārṅga slipped down from his hand 3.
22. 22-25; when Kṛṣṇa knew the truth, he
picked up the splendid bow and shot arrows
from it which cut off the heads of the
[Page149-a+ 38]
enemies 3. 23. 1-2. {@E.@} Status: The
Śārṅga bow of Viṣṇu counted among the only
three heavenly bows of divine beings, the
other two being Gāṇḍiva of Varuṇa and
Vijaya of Mahendra ({%trīṇy evaitāni divyāni%}
{%dhanūṃṣi divicāriṇām%}) 5. 155. 5; hence the
Vijaya bow obtained by Rukmin is said to
be comparable with the Śārṅga 5. 155. 4.
