{@Elāpatra@}¦ m.: A mythical serpent.
{@A.@} Son of Kadrū 1. 31. 6, 2. {@B@} He
told serpents what he heard when he crawled
into the lap of his mother when the curse
was pronounced by her; Brahmā had told the
gods the remedy partially to avoid the effect
of the curse; he therefore advised Vāsuki to
give his sister Jaratkāru to give in marriage
to sage Jaratkāru; their son would stop the
sacrifice of snakes 1. 34. 1-18; his advice
was received with joy by serpents 1. 35. 1;
Brahmā informed gods that what Elāpatra
had told the snakes was exactly what he
had in mind; Elāpatra's advice was to the
advantage of the serpents and that it would
prove true 1. 35. 8, 11. {@C.@} Elāpatra's
observation on life: One who is struck by fate
takes recourse to fate since he finds no other
way out ({%daivenopahato rājan yo bhaved%}
{%iha pūruṣaḥ / sa daivam evāśrayate nānyat%}
{%tatra parāyaṇam%} 1. 34. 3).
