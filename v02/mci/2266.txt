{@Garga<sup>2</sup>@}¦ m. (pl.): A class of sages
(born in the line of Garga).
<div n="P">Mentioned along with the great sages
Viśvāmitra and others ({%maharṣayaḥ%}) who
appeared to Droṇa when he started fight-
ing fiercely after hearing the news of Aśva-
tthāman's death; they all told him that
it was time for him to lay down the weapon
since the hour of his death had arrived;
it did not behove Droṇa to do anything
which would be more cruel than what he
had already done ({%ta enam abruvan sarve%}
{%droṇam … samayo nidhanasya te // nyasyā-%}
{%yudhaṃ raṇe droṇa … nātaḥ krūrataraṃ%}
{%karma punaḥ kartuṃ tvam arhasi //%}) 7.
