{@Śabara@}¦ m. (pl.): Name of a forest
tribe.
{@A.@} Location: (1) Listed by Saṃjaya
among the northern Janapadas (also called
Deśas 6. 10. 68) of the Bhāratavarṣa ({%ata%}
{%ūrdhvaṃ janapadān nibodha%}) 6. 10. 37, 5;
{%aṭavī śabarāś caiva%} 6. 10. 46 (Are Aṭavī-
śabaras living in the north different from
the other Śabaras who lived in the south ?
see the next); (2) Śabaras who lived in
the south ({%dakṣiṇāpathajanmānaḥ%}) 12. 200.
39 (these are, however, not listed by Saṃ-
jaya among the southern Janapadas of the
Bhāratavarṣa 6. 10. 56-63ab). {@B.@} Origin:
(1) Angered Nandinī, the cow of Vasiṣṭha,
created Śabaras from her dung ({%asṛjat … %}
{%śakṛtaḥ śabarān … krodhamūrcchitā%}) 1.
165. 35; this event is said to have occurred
also on a different occasion; when Viśvā-
mitra's army destroyed the forest near Vasi-
ṣṭha's {%āśrama,%} he angered, asked his cow
to produce Śabaras; accordingly she pro-
duced them ({%kruddho … vasiṣṭhaḥ … /%}
{%sṛjasva śabarān ghorān iti svāṃ gām uvāca%}
{%ha%}) 9. 39. 20; (2) Some Kṣatriyas are
also said to have been degraded to the
state of a {%vṛṣala%} due to their disregard of
Brāhmaṇas ({%śabarabarbarāḥ // … tās tāḥ%}
{%kṣatriyajātayaḥ / vṛṣalatvam anuprāptā%}
[Page881-b+ 40]
{%brāhmaṇānām adarśanāt //%}) 13. 35. 17-18;
elsewhere it is stated that the Kṣatriyas
who killed Jamadagni became {%vṛṣala%} due
to their transgressing the {%dharma%} of Kṣa-
triyas and their disregard of Brāhmaṇas
({%teṣāṃ%} (i. e. {%kṣatriyāṇām%}) {% … prajā vṛṣala-%}
{%tāṃ prāptā brāhmaṇānām adarśanāt // ta%}
{%ete … puṇḍrāś ca śabaraiḥ saha / vṛṣalatvaṃ%}
{%parigatā vyutthānāt kṣatradharmataḥ //%})
14. 29. 15-16; (3) But at one place it is
mentioned that Śabaras and others existed
since the Tretāyuga ({%tretāprabhṛti vartante%}
{%te janā … %} (i. e. Śabaras and others) 12.
200. 39, 42. {@C.@} Description: Fierce,
fierce to look at ({%ghora, ghoradarśana%}) 9.
39. 20-21. {@D.@} Their low status: They are
characterized as {%dasyus%} 12. 65. 17, 21; also
cf. {@F.@} Past events (2) below; those men
who did not perform sacrifices remained
for ever in the nether worlds and did not
go to heaven; such men are compared with
Pulindas and Śabaras ({%arvāk ca prati-%}
{%tiṣṭhanti pulīndaśabarā iva / na hy ayajñā%}
{%amuṃ lokaṃ prāpnuvanti kathaṃcana%}) 12.
147. 8; they are included among those
people who, though they lived in countries,
led the life of {%dasyus (śabarabarbarāḥ / … %}
{%sarve viṣayavāsinaḥ / sarve te dasyujīvi-%}
{%naḥ //)%} 12. 65. 13, 15; they did not believe in
Bhūtapati as the {%adhyakṣa%} (of the world);
sinful, they roamed over the earth leading
the life of dogs, crows, {%balas%} (?) and
vultures ({%niradhyakṣāṃs tu kaunteya kīrta-%}

{%pāpakṛtas tāta caranti pṛthivīm imām /%}
{%śvakākabalagṛdhrāṇāṃ sadharmāṇo … //%})
12. 200. 38-39, 41. {@E.@} Epic events:
(1) On the second day of the war,
Śabaras on the side of Pāṇḍavas stood on
the left side of the Krauñcāruṇavyūha (6.
[Page882-a+ 39]
46. 39; Krauñca 6. 47. 1) of Pāṇḍavas
({%vāmaṃ pārśvaṃ samāśritāḥ%}) 6. 46. 51;
(2) On the fourteenth day, Sātyaki
killed thousands of Śabaras (on the side
of Kauravas); he covered the ground
with their flesh and blood, and also with
their shaven heads and head gears ({%saśira-%}
{%strāṇaiḥ śirobhir lūnamūrdhajaiḥ%}) 7. 95.
38-40. {@F.@} Past event: (1) King Mān-
dhātṛ once asked Indra the nature of the
{%dharma%} of people like Śabaras and how
kings like him should govern them ({%kathaṃ%}
{%dharmaṃ careyus te … madvidhaiś ca%}
{%kathaṃ sthāpyāḥ%}) 12. 65. 13-15; thereupon
Indra told him the duties of Dasyus (the
term apparently covers Śabaras) 12. 65.
17-21; (2) A certain Brāhmaṇa, Gau-
tama by name, took residence in the house
of a Dasyu which is later designated as
the excellent house ({%gṛhavara%}) of a rich,
Śabara ({%śabarālaya%}) 12. 162. 30, 34; 12.
165. 5; 12. 167. 16 (see {@Dasyu,@} Past events
I, no. 7, p. 750 above).
