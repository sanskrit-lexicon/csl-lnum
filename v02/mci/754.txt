{@Bhāratasāvitrī@}¦ f.: Name of the four
stanzas (18. 5. 47-50) occurring towards
the end of the Mahābhārata 18. 5. 51.
<div n="P">The great sage Vyāsa having composed
in the bygone days this Bhārata Saṃhitā,
taught it to his son along with the four
stanzas 18. 5. 46; contents of these stanzas
[Page201-a+ 40]
(18. 5. 47-50): thousands of parents and
hundreds of sons and wives with whom one
lives in this world pass away and (many)
others will pass away (in future) (47);
only an ignorant, and not a wise person,
experiences day by day thousands of occasions
for delight and hundreds of occasions for
fear (48); here I, (i. e. Vyāsa himself)
with upraised hands, speak loudly (to
people): why do you not practise {%dharma%}
since from it proceed acquisition of profit
and fulfilment of desire ({%ūrdhvabāhur%}
{%viraumy eṣa na ca kaścic chṛṇoti me /%}
{%dharmād arthaś ca kāmaś ca sa kimar-%}
{%thaṃ na sevyate //%}) (49); one should not
forsake {%dharma%} for the fulfilment of desire,
nor out of fear, nor greed, nor even for
saving one's life; (for), {%dharma%} is eternal,
while happiness and misery are not eternal,
{%jīva%} (soul) is eternal its cause ({%hetu%} i. e.
body) is not eternal ({%na jātu kāmān na%}
{%bhayān na lobhād dharmaṃ tyajej jīvi-%}
{%tasyāpi hetoḥ / nityo dharmaḥ sukhaduḥkhe%}
{%tv anitye jīvo nityo hetur asya tv anityaḥ%})
(50); one who recites the Bhāratasāvitrī on
waking up in the morning obtains the fruit
of (reciting) the Bhārata and attains the
highest {%brahman (sa bhārataphataṃ prāpya%}
{%paraṃ brahmādhigacchati%}); (according to
Nīlakaṇṭha on Bom Ed. 18. 5. 60 these
stanzas bring together the essence of the
Bhārata and therefore deserve to be recited
({%tatra paṭhanayogyaṃ bhāratasārasaṃ-%}
{%grahaṃ catuḥślokīrūpam%}).
