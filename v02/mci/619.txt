{@Sudarśana cakra@}¦ nt.: Name of the
discuss used as a missile ({%astra%} 1. 216. 28;
[Page153-a+ 40]
10. 12. 15, 16, 18) by Kṛṣṇa (or Viṣṇu
{%vaiṣṇavam cakraṃ%} 5. 96. 18), often referred
to simply as Cakra; called Āgneya astra 1.
216. 21; 3. 23. 28; 7. 10. 21.
{@A.@} History: Fire in high flames,
permeated by smokeless fire, remains awake
in the form of Viṣṇu's cakra ({%vaiṣṇavaṃ%}
{%cakram%}) in Varuṇa's lake 5. 96. 18; at the
time of burning the Khāṇḍava forest, god
Agni asked Varuṇa to give for his sake the
Cakra to Vāsudeva (Kṛṣṇa) with which he
would execute a great deed (cf. also 16. 4. 3);
Varuṇa agreed to Agni's request (1. 216. 4)
and gave the Cakra, here called Āgneya
astra, to Kṛṣṇa; Agni told Kṛṣṇa that,
equipped with the Cakra, he would defeat
even superhuman beings in battle; he would
be superior to men, gods, demons, Piśācas,
Daityas and serpents when in battle he
was opposed by a very strong enemy; when-
ever Kṛṣṇa hurled in battle the Cakra
against his enemies, it would kill the enemy
without resistance and return to Kṛṣṇa's hand
1. 216. 21-24; Kṛṣṇa felt fully prepared to
fight with all the gods and demons when he
received the Cakra 1. 216. 26-27, 30, 21;
Arjuna felt confident that there was nothing
which Kṛṣṇa would not conquer when he had
the Cakra for use in battle 1. 216. 28;
according to the information of Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
Kṛṣṇa received the Cakra, identified with the
Āgneya astra, from the satisfied Agni after,
and not before, the burning of the forest 7.

Aśvatthāman was forbidden to use the
Brahmaśiras astra on any occasion whatso-
ever; so he wanted to exchange Brahmaśiras
for Kṛṣṇa's Sudarśana; Kṛṣṇa allowed Aśva-
tthāman to choose any one of his missiles,
including the Cakra, which he felt he could
wield and use in the battle; Aśvatthāman opted
for the Cakra, and when allowed by Kṛṣṇa
to take it, he first tried to pick it up with his
left hand; failing to move it, he tried his right
hand; when he could not move the Cakra
even with his right hand, he used all his might
(i. e. probably used both his hands together);
having failed in this attempt too, Aśvatthāman
in despair abandoned the attempt; Kṛṣṇa then
told him that he had asked for something very
unusual, for not even Arjuna, Pradyumna,
(Bala)rāma, Gada, Sāmba, nor any one of
the Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka heroes living in
Dvārakā had asked for it; Kṛṣṇa, out of
curiosity, asked Aśvatthāman whom he wanted
to fight with equipped with Sudarśana; Aśva-
tthāman admitted that he wanted to fight
with Kṛṣṇa himself and become invincible;
Aśvatthāman realised that the Cakra would
not leave Kṛṣṇa and hence he left Dvārakā
[Page155-a+ 40]
without it 10. 12. 14-38. {@F.@} Its use:
(1) In wars or events not related to the
epic: (i) when Viṣṇu was distributing the
{%amṛta%} among the gods, Rāhu cunningly
managed to get it; as the {%amṛta%} had
reached Rāhu's throat, Viṣṇu used the Cakra
to cut off his head; when severed by the
Cakra, the head fell on the ground and shook
the earth 1. 17. 5-7; (ii) in the war that
ensued between the gods and the demons
after the above incident Nara and Nārāyaṇa
appeared on the scene; Viṣṇu (Narāyaṇa)
then thought of his Sudarśana cakra; as soon
as thought of, it arrived from the sky ({%tato%}
{%'mbarāc cintitamātram āgatam%} 1. 17. 20);
armed with it, Viṣṇu used it against the
demons; it struck them again and again and
cut off the Daityas to pieces in thousands;
sometimes it licked the Dānavas and, over-
powering them, cut them off; sometimes it
burnt them like fire; hurled now in the sky
and then on the ground it drunk their blood
like a Piśāca; having heard that the Sudar-
śana cakra was angry, the demons disappeared
entering the earth and the ocean 1. 17. 18-28;
(iii) in Kṛṣṇa's war with Śālva who was
fighting from his Saubhapura, Kṛṣṇa released
his sharp-edged discuss, here called his dear
({%dayita%}) Āgneya astra (3. 23. 28), after
reciting {%mantras%} over it ({%abhimantrya%} 3.
23. 30) and using the strength of his arm
({%bhujavīryeṇa%} 3. 23. 31); Kṛṣṇa directed
his Cakra to strike down with its might the
Saubha and all the enemies living there; the
missile cut into two the Saubha town in the
middle as a saw might cut a pillar; after
achieving its objective the missile returned to
Kṛṣṇa's hand; Kṛṣṇa again shook it upwards
with great speed and released it with the
words: “(now) for Śālva” ({%punaś cod-%}
[Page155-b+ 40]
{%dhūya vegena śālvāyety aham abruvam%} 3. 23.
35); the discuss instantly cut Śālva into two,
who was then wielding a heavy {%gadā,%} and
then it blazed with its lustre 3. 23. 28-36;
(2) In wars or events related to the epic:
(1) at the time of the Khāṇḍava fire, Kṛṣṇa
killed many hosts of Daityas and Dānavas
with his Cakra; many others, were blown
away by the speed of the Cakra ({%cakra-%}
{%vegeritāḥ%}) 1. 218. 26-27; in this incident
Kṛṣṇa released his Cakra on animals and
other beings ({%tathānyā bhūtajātayaḥ%} 1. 219.
2) so that these, along with the Dānavas and
the night-stalkers ({%sadānavaniśācarāḥ%} 1. 219.
4) were cut into pieces by hundreds and they
fell into the fire; the Rākṣasas, cut by the
Cakra of Kṛṣṇa, looked like evening clouds;
Kṛṣṇa moved there like the god of Death kill-
ing by thousands Piśācas, birds, serpents and
animals with his Cakra; the Cakra, repeatedly
hurled, killed many beings and returned to
Kṛṣṇa's hand 1. 219. 2-7; if the Rākṣasas,
Dānavas and serpents tried to escape to-
gether ({%ekāyanagatāḥ saṅghībhūtāḥ%} Nī. on
1. 228. 34 Bom. Ed.) even then Kṛṣṇa killed
them and they fell into the flaming fire 1. 219.
30-31; Kṛṣṇa saw Asura Maya fleeing from
the house of Takṣaka and when Agni showed
his desire to burn him, Kṛṣṇa stood ready with
his raised Cakra to kill him; but Maya sought
help from Arjuna and was saved 1. 219.
35-39; (2) Enraged Kṛṣṇa cut off the head
of Śiśupāla with Cakra at the time of the
Rājasūya 2. 42. 21; 3. 15. 3-4; 12-13 (use
of Cakra not mentioned). {@G.@} Threatened
or eventual use in the epic war: (1) Dis-
appointed at Arjuna's softness ({%mṛduyuddha-%}
{%tām%} 6. 55. 63, 80) while fighting with Bhīṣma,
Kṛṣṇa took up his discuss ({%rathāṅgam%}) with
a view to killing Bhīṣma; raising his Cakra he
[Page156-a+ 40]
jumped down from the chariot and proceeded
on foot to attack Bhīṣma; the Sudarśana,
lotus-like and having a beautiful nave, shone
like the primeval lotus ({%ādipadma%}) rising
from the navel of Nārāyaṇa; seeing Kṛṣṇa
equipped with Cakra all beings cried aloud
thinking that that was the end of the Kurus;
Kṛṣṇa, holding the Cakra and jumping along,
looked as if he was revolving the world, or
he looked like the god of Death in the form of
Fire burning the creatures ({%saṃvartayiṣyann%}
{%iva jīvalokam / … bhūtāni dhakṣyann iva%}
{%kālavahniḥ%}) 6. 55. 92); (2) seeing Kṛṣṇa
rushing towards him with Cakra in hand,
Bhīṣma invited him from his chariot to put
an end to his life; when Arjuna, coming
from behind, assured Kṛṣṇa that he would
destroy the Kurus, Kṛṣṇa returned and holding
the discuss, mounted the chariot 6. 55. 83,
86-87, 89-94, 100-101; (3) Apprehending
that Arjuna might not be able to fulfil his vow
to kill Jayadratha before sunset, Kṛṣṇa thought
that his intervention in the war might become
necessary and he therefore asked Dāruka, his
charioteer, to keep his chariot ready with all
the missiles in it, including Cakra, so that he
would destroy the enemy's army with it 7.
56. 32, 28. (4) Kṛṣṇa, in order to incite
Arjuna who was somewhat overpowered
by Karṇa, showed readiness to give his
Cakra to him to cut off Karṇa's head with
it 8. 65. 19. {@H.@} Actual or possible defeat
of Sudarśana: (1) Viṣṇu's Cakra was
shattered on the limbs of Mandara, the son
of Hiraṇyakaśipu, owing to a boon Mandara
had received from Mahādeva (Śiva) 13. 14.
54; (2) even Kṛṣṇa with his Sudarśana
would not be able to vanquish Karṇa as long
as he was armed with Indra's ({%vāsavī%})
Śakti and was protected by his armour and
[Page156-b+ 39]
{%kuṇḍalas%} 7. 155. 17, (13-15). {@I.@} End
When the end of the Yādavas had arrived and
when they started for the {%tīrthayātrā%} on the
shore of the ocean, the Cakra, given to
Kṛṣṇa by Agni, left him and rose to the sky
even as the Vṛṣṇis watched it 16. 4. 3; when
Yudhiṣṭhira relinquished the kingdom to
Parikṣit and the Pāṇḍavas started for the
forest, god Agni appeared in bodily form
(17. 1. 33) and told them that the excellent
Cakra which stayed with Kṛṣṇa had dis-
appeared and that it would return to his hand
at the proper time ({%cakraratnaṃ tu yat%}
