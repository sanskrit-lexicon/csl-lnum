{@Dasyu@}¦ m. (pl.): Designation of a
class of people following a mode of life not
approved by the law-makers; sometimes
(especially in the Śāntiparvan) the term
designates robbers; they moved in groups,
hence sometimes referred to as {%dasyugaṇa.%}

in the unlawful way was choosing the
{%dharma%} of Dasyus 7. 131. 2; (2) By referr-
ing to the unlawful and dangerous acts of
Dasyus: (i) Yavanas, Kirātas and others,
though they lived in towns, followed the
way of Dasyus ({%sarve te dasyujīvinaḥ%}) 12.

there were Dasyus living in disguise among

asked Bhīṣma how should a Brāhmaṇa,
who did not want to give up his sons and
grandsons, live when the {%dharma%} was at
its lowest ebb, when all means of sub-
sistence were under the control of Dasyus
({%sarvasmin dasyusādbhūte pṛthivyām upa-%}

{%asādhu%} in 12. 130. 2-3); 12. 138. 1; 12.

men since old times thinking ‘they have
wealth’; they torture men inflicting on
them various punishments and always
distress them ({%dhanam asyeti puruṣaṃ%}
{%purā nighnanti dasyavaḥ%}) 12. 171. 36; (v)
As good men do not take what belongs
to others, so do Dasyus not practise
non-violence; people are pleased with
Dasyus if they observe restraint ({%yathā%}

is not fighting, violation of wives of others,
ungratefulness, robbing a Brāhmaṇa of
his wealth, leaving him without any posse-
ssions ({%niḥśeṣakaraṇaṃ tathā%}), robbing
women, coersion ({%paristhānam%} cf. Critical
Notes Vol. 14. p. 932), all this is practised
by Dasyus and is censurable; and even
if a Dasyu does not practise such acts,
he is all the same a Dasyu ({%dasyuṣv etad%}

of a Dasyu is considered wretched ({%prākṛto%}
{%vadha ucyate%}) and is equated with death
[Page746-a+ 40]
due to poison, hanging, or burns, or
due to getting killed by animals having
jaws 12. 286. 25 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 297.

{%raṇa%} cf. {%yogī atyantavyādhipīḍāgrasto 'pi%}
{%durmaraṇaṃ necched ity arthaḥ%}); (viii)
Dasyus are the limit; (1) even Dasyus
do not trust in those who act merci-
lessly ({%dasyavo 'py upaśaṅkante niranu-%}
{%krośakāriṇaḥ%}) 12. 131. 11; (2) even
Dasyus trust ascetics ({%tāpaseṣu hi viśvā-%}
{%sam api kurvanti dasyavaḥ%}) 12. 87. 28;
(3) The Rākṣasas refused to eat the flesh
of the mean Gautama, and suggested that
it might be distributed among the Dasyus;
but even Dasyus did not wish to eat
the flesh of the sinful and unfaithful
Gautama, nor the beasts of prey 12. 166.
18-19, 22-23; (ix) Dasyus are equated
with impious men; when Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
Pāṇḍu and Vidura were born, there were
no Dasyus in the Kuru land, nor other
impious men ({%nābhavan dasyavaḥ kecin%}
{%nādharmarucayo janāḥ%}) 1. 102. 5; (x) If
Brāhmaṇas parted company with Kṣatri-
yas, the latter became degraded and were
as good as Dasyus ({%apadhvastā dasyu-%}
{%bhūtā bhavanti ye brāhmaṇāḥ kṣatriyān%}
{%saṃtyajanti%}) 12. 74. 10. {@E.@} The Duties
of Dasyus: On being questioned by
Māndhātṛ about the {%dharma%} of Dasyus
({%kathaṃ dharmaṃ careyus te%} 12. 65. 15),
Indra told him in details the duties of
Dasyus which included service ({%śuṣrūṣā%})
to parents, teachers, elders, ascetics and
kings, gifts to twice-born, observance of
non-violence, truth, purity, faithfulness
and other virtues 12. 65. 17-22; a Dasyu
who lived within limits did not perish
after his death; this is illustrated by
[Page746-b+ 40]
the narrative of Kāpavya; those Dasyus
who observed their {%dharma%} achieved
perfections ({%api te dasyavo bhūtvā kṣi-%}
{%praṃ siddhim avāpnuyuḥ%}) 12. 133. 1-22.
{@F.@} Limitations of Dasyus: They are not
able to overpower a person who has no
desires and one who is free from (the fear
of) loss of wealth ({%na ca dasyavaḥ /%}
{%prabhavanti dhanajyāninirmuktasya nirā-%}
{%śiṣaḥ%}) 12. 170. 12. {@G.@} King's relationship
with Dasyus: Indra created for a king
his duty and armour, weapon and bow, for
killing Dasyus ({%indreṇedaṃ dasyuvadhāya%}
{%karma utpāditaṃ varma śastraṃ dhanuś%}
{%ca%}) 5. 29. 27 (But Nī. on Bom. Ed. 5. 29.
30: {%karma yuddhaṃ%}); Brahman created
Kṣatriyas for killing Dasyus who obstruct-
ed those that were engaged in agriculture,
cattle-care, trade, and also those who
performed the duties of Hotṛ, Adhvaryu
and Udgātṛ priests ({%ūrdhvaṃ caiva trayī%}
{%vidyā%}) 12. 90. 7-8 (Nī., however, on Bom.
Ed. 12. 89. 7: {%ūrdhvaṃ svargam%}); a
Kṣatriya should always be ready to kill
Dasyus in battles 12. 60. 14; for a king,
there is no higher duty than destroying
Dasyus 12. 60. 17; their absence, (as
also of beggars), in a kingdom considered
desirable 12. 89. 20; a king should take
his subjects into confidence by drawing
their attention to the danger posed by
his enemies who collaborated with Dasyus
12. 88. 26; a king must protect all the
{%varṇas%} if the Dasyus tried to plunder
their wives and possessions 13. 47. 44; a
king who saved the beings from Dasyus
and gave them wealth and happiness
was a great king ({%dasyubhyaḥ prāṇadānāt%}
{%sa dhanadaḥ sukhado virāṭ%}) 12. 98. 8; if
a king did not protect his subjects, they
[Page747-a+ 40]
could be at the mercy of Dasyus ({%loko%}

Bom. Ed. 12. 68. 20: {%dasyusāt corādhī-%}
{%nāḥ%}); if due to a king's negligence his
subjects were being robbed, such a king
was Kali 12. 12. 27; Yudhiṣṭhira wanted
to know if there were boundaries beyond
which he should not allow Dasyus to
step ({%asti svid dasyumaryādā yām ahaṃ%}
{%parivarjaye%}) 12. 140. 1 (Nī. on Bom. Ed.
12. 142. 1: {%dasyūnām akāryakāriṇām api%}
{%maryādā kācid asti ito 'dhikaṃ dasyūnāṃ na%}
{%kartavyam iti%}); when a king behaved dis-
regarding all restraints and in such a state
Dasyus brought about total confusion, then
if all {%varṇas%} took up weapons (to protect
themselves) no blemish attached to them
({%unmaryāde pravṛtte tu dasyubhiḥ saṃkare%}
{%kṛte / sarve varṇā na duṣyeyuḥ śastra-%}
{%vanto … %}) 12. 79. 18; if the power of Dasyus
increased ({%abhyutthite dasyubale%}), then
even a Brāhmaṇa, Vaiśya or Śūdra should
hold the rod of punishment in hand and
protect the subjects from Dasyus; any
one, Śūdra or some one else, whom the
subjects, when tortured by Dasyus, turned
for protection should be honoured (12.
79. 34-35, 38); a king in whose dominion
hordes of Dasyus freely plundered the posse-
ssions of others, as do crows the fishes
in water, was contemptible among the
Kṣatriyas ({%sa vai kṣatriyapāṃsanaḥ%}) 12.

which has no ruler and which is weak ({%ani-%}

out proper means of subsistence, their oxen
and draught-animals did not prosper, the

churned (because the pot was empty)

Bom. Ed. 12. 73. 7: {%anu paścāt prakāśamā-%}
{%naṃ balam anvagbalaṃ yathā syāt tathā%});
a king might take away the wealth of Dasyus
(and of those who did not perform sacri-
fices) 12. 134. 2; a king should always
kill Dasyus and should not pardon any
one on any account ({%nihanyāt sarvato%}
{%dasyūn na kāmāt kasyacit kṣamet%}) 12. 76.
5; Dyumatsena told Satyavant that if
Dasyus were not awarded capital punish-
ment, there would be chaos everywhere;
in the Kali age, one would say: ‘this was
mine, not his’ and normal life would be
impossible ({%lokayātrā na caiva syāt%}) 12.

267. 6: {%lokayātrā tīrthagamanavāṇijyā-%}
{%divyavahāraḥ kalau yuge adharmapra-%}
{%dhāne kāle%}); however, a king should be
careful while giving capital punishment to
Dasyus, because when a Dasyu died, many
other innocents dependent on him, like
his wife, mother, father, son, also got
killed for no fault of theirs ({%rājā tasmāṭ%}
[Page748-a+ 40]
{%samyak pradhārayet%}) 12. 259. 10; but, a
Dasyu, in fact, did not belong to men,

{%bandhābhāvāt%}); entering into an agreement
(with Dasyus) who were ignorant and of

times, if a king had to take resort to a
[Page748-b+ 40]
forest and live with Dasyus he should
not associate with Dasyus who threw
all norms of behaviour to the winds;
it was easy to raise an army of Dasyus

conquest of the north before the Rāja-

in the forest in the northeast ({%prāguttarāṃ%}

Yudhiṣṭhira asked Saṃjaya whether the
Kauravas, if they encountered the bands

(3) Arjuna told Saṃjaya that when he
would scatter the hordes of Dasyus gather-
ed for the battle, Dhṛtarāṣṭra and his
sons would repent 5. 47. 59; (4) On the
fourteenth day of war, Sātyaki covered
the earth with the shaven heads of Dasyus
together with their headgears 7. 95. 40; he
killed many Dasyus 7. 97. 20; (5) Kṛṣṇa
told Babhru to protect the Yādava women
so that they were not attacked by Dasyus
due to their greed for wealth ({%naitā hiṃ-%}
{%syur dasyavo vittalobhāt%}) 16. 5. 4; (6)
When Arjuna stopped at Pañcanada on his
way to Hāstinapura with Vṛṣṇi women,
Dasyus became greedy and took counsel
among themselves; then, thousands of
them, using sticks as weapons, attacked
Vṛṣṇis desirous of looting property; they
disregarded Arjuna's warning and continued
their attack; Arjuna could not check them
as he forgot his {%astras;%} the Vṛṣṇi warriors
could not stop Dasyus running away with
Vṛṣṇi women; Arjuna and the Vṛṣṇi
warriors killed some of the plundering
Dasyus with arrows; when Arjuna's arrows
were exhausted, he killed Dasyus with the
tip of his bow; but that was of no avail;
before his very eyes, Dasyus ({%mlecchas%})
took away Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka women 16.

(6) In order to illustrate that a Dasyu,
who observed proper limits, did not perish
after death ({%yathā dasyuḥ samaryādaḥ%}
{%pretyabhāve na naśyati%}) is told the story
of Kāpavya; he was born of a Niṣādī by a
Kṣatriya; he obtained perfection on account
of his being a (good) Dasyu (since he
lived righteously carrying out the duties
of a Kṣatriya) ({%dasyutvāt siddhim āptavān%});
when the Brāhmaṇas, who had retired to
a forest, did not accept food brought to
them by Kāpavya because he was a Dasyu,
he left some of it in their homes and went
away early in the morning; many Dasyus
who behaved cruelly disregarding the rules
elected Kāpavya as their leader; they
agreed to live as instructed by him and
requested him to act as their father
and mother; he taught them the way they

Gautama by name, happened to take
shelter in the house of a wealthy Dasyu
who was truthful and generous; Gautama
got from the Dasyu new garments and
wife; he lived there happily and helped the
Dasyu to maintain his family; like the
Dasyus, Gautama began to kill geese
({%vakrāṅgān%}) with arrows (Nī. who reads
{%cakrāṅgān%} explains it as {%haṃsān,%} Bom. Ed.
12. 168. 36): the Brāhmaṇa Gautama, due
to contact with Dasyus and leading their
life, became similar to them ({%dasyubhiḥ%}
{%samatām iyāt%}); many months passed while
Gautama lived happily in the settlement of
the Dasyus ({%dasyugrāme%}) killing many
birds ({%pakṣiṇaḥ%}); once another Brāhmaṇa
happened to arrive in that settlement of the
Dasyus ({%dasyugrāmam%}); in that settlement
which was full of Dasyus ({%grāme dasyu-%}
{%janākīrṇe%}) he searched everywhere for a
Brāhmaṇa; he entered the house where
Gautama lived; he recognized that Gautama
belonged to Madhyadeśa; he asked Gau-
tama how he came to live like a Dasyu
