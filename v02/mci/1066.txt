{@Ṛṣikulyā<sup>2</sup>@}¦ f.: Name of a river.
<div n="P">Listed by Saṃjaya among the rivers of
the Bhāratavarṣa; people use its water for
drinking purposes 6. 10. 34, 13; all the rivers
listed here are described as mothers of the
universe and very strong 6. 10. 35 (for cita-
tion see {@Atikṛṣṇā@}); finds mention in the
Daivata-Ṛṣi-Vaṃśa 13. 151. 21, 2; [{%ṛṣikulyāḥ%}
(pl.) 2. 25. 4: probably not a proper name;
when Arjuna went beyond the Śveta moun-
tain and ran over the Hāṭaka country, he saw
the lake Mānasa and many small rivers of the
Ṛṣis ({%ṛṣikulyāś ca tāḥ sarvā dadarśa … %})].
