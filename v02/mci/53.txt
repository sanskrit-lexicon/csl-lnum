{@Kadrū@}¦ f.: A mythical being.
{@A.@} Family: Daughter of Dakṣa Prajāpati
({%dakṣakanyā%}), sister of Vinatā, wife of
Kaśyapa 1. 14. 6; 1. 59. 13. {@B.@} Her
progeny: Mother of all serpents ({%bhujagānām%}
{%aśeṣāṇāṃ mātā kadrūr iti śrutiḥ%} 1. 49. 5);
hence serpents called {%kadrūputra-%} 1. 30. 11;
1. 14. 8; 1. 23. 5; {%kadruja%} 13. 151. 13;
[also see Kādraveya]; according to 1. 60. 66,
however, Surasā (daughter of Tāmrā ? 1. 50.
54, 59, of Śukī ? 1. 60. 57, of Kadrū 1. 60.
66) gave birth to {%nāgas%} (also 5. 101. 4)
and Kadrū to {%pannagas;%} after marriage,
Kaśyapa, her husband, granted her a boon;
she chose to be the mother of a thousand
serpents ({%vavre kadrūḥ sutān nāgān%}
{%sahasram%}) 1. 14. 6-8, 10; 1. 31. 2; after
a long period she lay one thousand eggs
which were preserved in warm pots ({%sopa-%}
{%svedeṣu bhāṇḍeṣu%}) and the serpents came
out of the eggs after five hundred years 1.
14. 12-14 [Nī. {%sopasvedeṣu uṣmavatsu / tatra%}
{%hy aṇḍāntarjalam ūṣmaṇā śīghraṃ ghanī-%}
{%bhavatīti%} on 1. 16. 15 Bom. edn.]; principal
{%nāgas%} like Śeṣa, Vāsuki and others listed
among the sons of Kadrū ({%kādraveyāḥ%}) 1.
31. 4 ff.; 1. 59. 40; Śeṣa left Kadrū to practise
[Page010-a+ 41]
austerity on the Gandhamādana 1. 32. 2.
{@C.@} Myth: Kadrū once asked Vinatā about
the colour of the horse Uccaiḥśravas; Vinatā
declared it to be white and asked Kadrū to say
what she felt about it and then offered to put
a wager on it ({%tato 'tra vipaṇāvahe%}) 1. 18.
3; Kadrū said that the horse had dark hair
on its tail; she accepted Vinatā's challenge
and specified slavery as a stake ({%ehi sārd-%}
{%dhaṃ mayā dīvya dāsībhāvāya bhāmini%})
1. 18. 4, 5; 1. 19. 2; 1. 24. 9; Kadrū asked
her serpent sons to turn themselves into
black hair and enter the horse (i. e. his
tail) so that she did not lose the contest;
when the serpents did not agree she cursed
them that they would be burnt in the snake-
sacrifice of Janamejaya 1. 18. 6-8; 1. 49.
5-7; Pitāmaha thought her curse to be too
cruel 1. 18. 9; next morning Kadrū and
Vinatā went to inspect the colour of
Uccaiḥśravas 1. 19. 1-2; on way they crossed
the ocean 1. 20. 1; on inspection they found
black hair sticking to the tail of the horse;
Kadrū, the winner of the bet, made Vinatā
her {%dāsī%} 1. 20. 2; once Kadrū asked Vinatā
to carry her to the abode of the {%nāgas%}
inside the ocean ({%samudrakukṣau%}); Kadrū,
the mother of serpents ({%sarpamātā%}), was
taken there by Vinatā 1. 21. 3-5; Kadrū
praised Śakra to obtain relief for her sons
when they, riding on the back of Garuḍa, were
tormented by the rays of the sun and had
swooned 1. 21. 6; pleased, Śakra showered
rain to the delight of the serpents 1. 22. 1.
{@D.@} Mahāgraha: Kadrū mentioned among
afflictions ({%grahāḥ, mahāgrahāḥ%}) unfavour-
able to the newly born children until they were
sixteen; assumes a subtle form and enters
the body of a pregnant woman; she eats up
the foetus and the woman delivers a serpent 3.
219. 22, 36, 41 [as told by Skanda, Mothers,
[Page010-b+ 38]
in various forms, afflict young children for the
first sixteen years 3. 219. 22].
