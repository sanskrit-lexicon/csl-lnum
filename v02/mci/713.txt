{@Daivatavaṃśa@}¦ m.: Name of a passage
in the Anuśasanaparvan listing the names
of gods, goddesses, and other beings ({%ayaṃ%}
{%daivatavaṃśo vai%}) 13. 151. 2.
<div n="P">Besides listing names of gods like
Pitāmaha (Brahmadeva) with Sāvitrī,
Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa, Umāpati (Śiva), Virūpā-
kṣa, Skanda, Viśākha and others, it contains
also such names like Surabhi (cow), Sāgara
(ocean), and Gaṅgā (river); it has names
of sages like the Vālakhilyas, Kṛṣṇa-dvai-
pāyana, Nārada and Parvata; of Gandhar-
vas like Viśvāvasu Hahāhuhū and others;
of Apsarases like Urvaśī, Menakā, Rambhā
and others; it mentions also group-gods like
the Ādityas, the Vasus, the Rudras, the
Aśvinā, and also the Pitṛs; personified
concepts like {%dharma, satya;%} divisions of
time like nights and days, seasons, months,
twilights; names of planets (Śukra, Brhaspati
and the rest) and Nakṣatras (not listed);
mythical birds (Vainateyas) and serpents
({%kadrujāḥ%}); rivers like Śatadrū, Vipāśā
and others; holy places of pilgrimage like
Prayāga, Prabhāsa and others; mountains like
Himavant, Vindhya and the rest—all these
also find a place in this list 13. 151. 3-28;
[Page184-b+ 40]
together with the Ṛṣivaṃśa, this Daivata-
vaṃśa is described as the ‘first collection’
of its kind ({%eṣa vai samavāyas te ṛṣi-%}
{%devasamanvitaḥ / ādyaḥ prakīrtito rājan%})
13. 151. 40; also {%ayaṃ daivatavaṃśo vai%}
{%ṛṣivaṃśasamanvitaḥ%} 13. 151. 2; the recita-
tion of the two {%vaṃśas%} together at two
twilights is very effective in removing sins
({%dvisaṃdhyaṃ paṭhitaḥ putra kalmāṣā-%}
{%paharaḥ paraḥ%}) 13. 151. 2; ({%sarvapāpa-%}
{%pramocanaḥ%}) 13. 151. 40; ({%mucyate sarva-%}
{%kilbiśaiḥ%}) 13. 151. 29; one who recites these
names of gods or welcomes their recitation
is freed of dangers from all quarters and
from sins arising from all kinds of promis-
cuous behaviour ({%stuvaṃś ca pratinandaṃś%}
{%ca mucyate sarvato bhayāt / sarvasaṃkara-%}
{%pāpebhyo devatāstavanandakaḥ //%}) 13. 151.
29. [See {@Ṛṣivaṃśa@}]
