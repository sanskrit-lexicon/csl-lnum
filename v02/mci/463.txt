{@Iṣīkā@}¦ f.: A reed or a straw, instead
of an arrow, used as a missile by Aśvat-
thāman; the {%astra%} employed on it not named,
but apparently identical with Brahmaśiras
(10. 12. 4, 40).
<div n="P">Described as a ‘powerful missile’
({%paramāstra%}) 10. 13. 17; 10. 15. 12, 23, 33;
10. 16. 8; ‘heavenly’ ({%divya%}) 10. 15. 16,
25; ‘unparalleled’ ({%durāsada%}) 10. 15. 16;
‘fierce’ ({%ghora%}) 10. 15. 11; ‘unfailing’
({%amogha%}) 10. 15. 31; (10. 16. 8); ‘produc-
ing big flames and surrounded by a circle
of lustre’ ({%mahājvālaṃ tejomaṇḍalasaṃ-%}
{%vṛtam%}) 10. 14. 8; when challenged by
Bhīma, who was followed by Arjuna and
Yudhiṣṭhira in a chariot, driven by Kṛṣṇa,
Aśvatthāman took a reed ({%iṣīkā%}) in the left
hand ({%saveyna pāṇinā%}) and thought of the
heavenly missile, recited {%mantras%} on it to
imbibe it with the lustre of fire ({%vahnitejo%}
{%'numantrya vai%} 10. 15. 16), and released it
for the destruction of the Pāṇḍavas ({%apāṇḍa-%}
{%vāya%} 10. 13. 18; 10. 15. 16); fire broke out
from the reed which threatened to burn the
three worlds 10. 13. 15-20; to counter it,
Arjuna released Brahmaśiras (10. 15. 23)
saying ‘let the missile be pacified by missile’
({%astram astreṇa śāmyatām%}) 10. 14. 2-6;
10. 15. 20; (however, according to 1. 1. 155
Arjuna said {%‘svasti’%} while releasing his
missile); apprehending great danger to the
creatures from the fire released by the two
missiles, Nārada and Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana
stood between them and appealed to the
two heroes to withdraw their missiles since
they were never used by any one before 10.
14. 7-16; accordingly, Arjuna withdrew it
(10. 15. 1, 5, 10), but Aśvatthāman could not
[Page094-a+ 39]
withdraw it (10. 15. 11) and he admitted to
the sages his inability to follow their advice
10. 15. 15; he said the missile must achieve its
purpose and destroy all the sons of Pāṇḍu 10.
15. 17; but Vyāsa pointed out that if Aśvat-
thāman's {%paramāstra%} were to subdue Arjuna's
Brahmaśiras there would be no rain in the
land for twelve years; (however, according to
1. 1. 155 one {%astra%} was pacified by the other
{%astram astreṇa śāntam%}); Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana
therefore asked again Aśvatthāman to with-
draw his missile and save the nation and the
Pāṇḍavas 10. 15. 25-26; but since the missile
could not be totally withdrawn, Aśvatthāman
suggested that the missile should fall, not on
the Pāṇḍavas, but on their foetus ({%iṣīkā%}
{%nipatiṣyati /garbheṣu pāṇḍaveyānām%} 10.
15. 31); when permitted by Vyāsa to do that,
Aśvatthāman directed the missile to the
foetus 10. 15. 32-33; it was then destined to
hit the foetus in the womb of Uttarā 10. 16.
7-8 [See {@Aiṣikāstra@} and {@Brahmaśiras@}].
