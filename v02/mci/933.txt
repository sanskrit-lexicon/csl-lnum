{@Rāhu@}¦ m.: Name of a planet, also called
{@Svarbhānu@} (6. 13. 39-40; 13. 17. 37).
{@A.@} Description: Described as round
({%parimaṇḍala%}) 6. 13. 40; fierce ({%tīvra%})
6. 3. 26; dark ({%śyāma%}) 6. 3. 15; blazing,
({%prajvalita%}) 6. 3. 15; having smoke and fire
{%sadhūmaḥ sahapāvakaḥ%}) 6. 3. 15; having
[Page266-b+ 40]
copper-red crest ({%? tāmra° °śikha%}) 6. 3. 24.
{@B.@} Importance: Chief among the planets
({%grahapatir varaḥ%}) 13. 17. 37; Rāhu, along
with other planets, visits the {%sabhā%} of Brah-
man 2. 11. 20, 19; Rāhu, not directly named
but probably referred to as Grahapati, finds
place in the list of a thousand names of
Śiva ({%ketugraho grahapatir varaḥ%}) 13. 17.
37 (however, Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 17. 38,
interprets {%grahaḥ%} as {%rāhuḥ: ketuś ca prasid-%}
{%dhaḥ / candrākrau gṛhṇātīti graho rāhuḥ /%}
{%grahāṇāṃ patiḥ [grahapatiḥ] krūratvāt%}
{%maṃgalaḥ%}); Rāhu finds place also in the
Daivatavaṃśa 13. 151. 12. {@C.@} Measure-
ment: Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya to tell
him complete extent ({%sarvaṃ (pramāṇaṃ)%})
of Rāhu, to which Saṃjaya agreed 6. 12.
3-4; according to the information of Saṃ-
jaya his diameter ({%viṣkambha%}) was 12000
{%yojanas,%} and his circumference ({%pariṇāha%})
36000 {%yojanas;%} according to the learned
Paurāṇikas his expanse ({%? vipulatva%}) was
6000 {%yojanas (parimaṇḍalo mahārāja svar-%}
{%bhānuḥ śrūyate grahaḥ / yojanānāṃ saha-%}
{%srāṇi viṣkambho dvādaśāsya vai // pariṇā-%}
{%hena ṣaṭtriṃśad vipulatvena cānagha /%}
{%ṣaṣṭim āhuḥ śatāny asya budhāḥ paurā-%}
{%ṇikās tathā)%} 6. 13. 40-41 (Nī. on Bom.
Ed. 6. 12. 41 interprets {%vipulatvena%} as
{%tato 'py ādhikyena, idam uttarānvayi;%} in
that case the circumference of Rāhu will be
36000 + 6000 = 42000 {%yojanas;%} see also
Editor's note on the stanza, Cr. Ed. Vol. 7,
p. 765: “Saṃjaya is here relying upon his
studies, and not upon the Eye Divine”);
owing to its being larger in size than the sun
and the moon, Rāhu covers them both at
proper times ({%sa rāhuś chādayaty etau%}
(i. e. {%candrādityau%}) {%yathākālaṃ mahattayā%})
6. 13. 45. {@D.@} Omens: (1) Among the
[Page267-a+ 40]
bad omens for the Kurus reported by Vyāsa
to Dhṛtarāṣṭra one was related to Rāhu's
swallowing the sun 6. 3. 11; this event is
again referred to by Vyāsa as occurring
at an improper time, i. e. on the thirteenth
day of the month and in which Rāhu swa-
llowed both Candra and Sūrya together;
this meant destruction of the subjects 6. 3.
28-29 (for citation and Nī.'s commentary
see {@Sūrya@} below); also cf. 14. 76. 15; 2. 71.
26; 9. 55. 10; the same was also noted by
Karṇa and reported to Kṛṣṇa ({%rāhur arkam%}
{%upaiṣyati%}) 5. 141. 10 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 5. 143.
11: {%ayaṃ kartarīyogaḥ somavaṃśyānāṃ%}
{%sūryavaṃśyānāṃ ca rājñāṃ kṣayakara%}
{%ity arthaḥ%}); (reference to Rāhu implied in
6. 73. 10: {%prajāsaṃharaṇe sūryaḥ krūrair%}
{%iva mahāgrahaiḥ (parivṛtaḥ);%} (2) Among
the omens noticed by Vyāsa there was also
another according to which a black planet
(= Rāhu) blazing, and full of smoke and
fire had gone over to Jyeṣṭhā and remained
there ({%śyāmo grahaḥ prajvalitaḥ sadhū-%}
{%maḥ sahapāvakaḥ / … jyeṣṭhām ākramya%}
{%tiṣṭhati //%})) 6. 3. 15 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 3.
16 reads {%śveto grahaḥ%} in place of {%śyāmo%}
{%grahaḥ%} and explains it as Ketu: {%śveto dvitīya%}
{%upagrahaḥ ketusaṃjñaḥ%}); (3) Vyāsa
had also noticed that the two Grahas
(Rāhu and Ketu ?) having copper-red and
ruddy crests (respy. ?) appear blazing in the
sky and cover up the lustre of the seven
sages (i. e. the constellation Ursa Major)
({%grahau tāmrāruṇaśikhau prajvalantāv iva%}
{%sthitau / saptar ṣīṇām udārāṇāṃ samavac-%}
{%chādya vai prabhām //%}) 6. 3. 24; (4)
Kṛṣṇa observed that the {%amāvāsyā%} had
already set in on the thirteenth day of the
dark half of the month and that Rāhu had
turned the fourteenth day into the fifteenth
[Page267-b+ 40]
(which was looked upon as bad); he told the
Yādavas that such an event had happened
only once before at the time of the Bhārata
war (a reference to 6. 3. 28-29 above) and
that it had now occurred again to foretell
the destruction of the Yādavas ({%trayo-%}

{%cādya kṣayāya naḥ //%}) 16. 3. 16-17 (Nī. on
Bom. Ed. 16. 2. 19, notices a hint of a solar
eclipse in this statement: {%evaṃ saty agrima-%}
{%pakṣe vṛddhyā bhāvyaṃ tan na jātaṃ%}
{%praty uta ekā tithiḥ kṣīṇā tatra grahaṇaṃ%}
