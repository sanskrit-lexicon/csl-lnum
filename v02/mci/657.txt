{@Āyurveda@}¦ m.: Name of the science of

<div n="P">Even the physicians studying the Āyur-
veda themselves or their families are afflicted
by diseases and although they take various
[Page171-a+ 38]
decoctions ({%kaṣāyas%}) and clarified butter
({%sarpīṃṣi%}) for cure, they cannot avoid death
12. 28. 44-45;—Kṛṣṇa tells Arjuna that
his many names have been recounted by
great sages in the Sāṃkhya, the Yogaśāstra
and the Āyurveda 12. 328. 9; those versed
in the Āyurveda give the name Tridhātu to
Kṛṣṇa, since the body has three constituents
[bile ({%pitta%}), phlegm ({%śleṣman%}) and
wind ({%vāyu%})] and is sustained by them
and when they are wasted away the body
is emaciated 12. 330. 21-22 [Nī. explains
Tridhātu as {%trayo dhātava upādhibhutāḥ%}
{%santy asya sa tridhātuḥ%} on Bom. Ed. 12.
342. 87].
