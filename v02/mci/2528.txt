Greatness: While narrating the descent of
the first generations ({%ādivaṃśāvatāra%}),
Vaiśaṃpāyana told Janamejaya that the all-

{% … upāsīnā vāsudevasya buddhiṃ nigṛhya%}
{%śatrūn suhṛdo nandayanti%}) 5. 28. 11; no one
in the past was or in the future would be
equal to Vṛṣṇis in strength; they did not
disregard kinsmen, were obedient to elders,
gods, Asuras, Gandharvas, Yakṣas, Rākṣa-
sas; men were unable to defeat Vṛṣṇi
warriors in battles: they did not rob Brāh-
maṇas, teachers, kinsmen of their wealth;
on the other hand, if any one of them was
in difficulty they protected him; they were
wealthy, but were not arrogant; truthful,
they were devoted to Brāhmaṇas; they did
not underrate the strong ones, they uplifted
the weak ones; they worshipped gods, were
controlled and generous, but not given to
boasting; due to these virtues Vṛṣṇi warriors
were not attacked; one might carry moun-
tain Meru, cross the ocean, but not succeed
if he dared attack Vṛṣṇi warriors ({%na%}

from Nārada the massive mutual destruc-
tion of the Vṛṣṇis—a reference to a later
event (see below No. 65) in the summary
of the contents of the Āśramavāsikaparvan
1. 2. 217 (actually this event does not
form part of the Āśramavāsikaparvan but
of the Mausalaparvan and Yudhiṣṭhira
did not get the news from Nārada but
from Dāruka (cf. 16. 1. 7; 16. 6. 11);
Arjuna seeing Dvārakā without Vṛṣṇis was
dejected 1. 2. 223; he performed the funeral
rites of Rāma, Kṛṣṇa and other Vṛṣṇi-chiefs
({%vṛṣṇīnāṃ ca pradhānataḥ%}); he felt sad on
account of the abduction of Vṛṣṇi women
({%nāśaṃ vṛṣṇikalatrāṇām%}) 1. 2. 227—all
three events are references given in the
summary of the Mausalaparvan to later epic
events (see below Epic events Nos. 70-75);
(3) Vṛṣṇis learnt the science of archery
({%dhanurveda%}) from Kṛpa 1. 120. 21; Vṛṣṇis
and Andhakas approached Droṇa to learn
the {%astras (astrārthe … vṛṣṇayaś cāndhakāś%}

ed the {%svayaṃvara%} of Draupadī 1. 177. 18;
as advised by Kṛṣṇa they watched the pro-
ceedings of the {%svayaṃvara%} 1. 178. 8;
(5) Bhoja, Vṛṣṇi, and Andhaka women
gathered to see Arjuna when he arrived at
Dvārakā; Bhojas, Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas
honoured and greeted Arjuna; he paid his
respects to the deserving among them;
Vṛṣṇis, along with Bhojas and Andhakas
celebrated a grand festival in honour of
the Raivataka mountain; in that festival,
Vṛṣṇis and others gave gifts to thousands
of Brāhmaṇas; thousands of illustrious
youths of Vṛṣṇis put on ornaments and
moved about riding vehicles decorated with
gold; their wives and followers accompani-
ed them 1. 211. 1-2, 5-6; (6) On hearing
[Page867-a+ 40]
the sound of the drum sounded by the
guardian of the Sabhā, agitated Vṛṣṇis and
Andhakas, leaving aside food and drink,
assembled by hundreds in the Sabhā and
took their seats on the {%siṃhāsanas;%} the
Sabhāpāla told them that Arjuna had ab-
ducted Subhadrā; on hearing it they leaped
up from their seats and asked their chari-
oteers to yoke the chariots and bring their
weapons, bows and armours; others brought
forth their gold-decked horses; when all
these arrangements were being done there
arose a confused sound of the Vṛṣṇi
heroes 1. 212. 12-19; Bhojas, Vṛṣṇis and
Andhakas got ready to follow Balarāma
when he announced his intention to fight
with Arjuna ({%anvapadyanta te sarve bhoja-%}
{%vṛṣṇyandhakās tadā%}) 1. 212. 31-32; Vṛṣṇis
made their intention to attack Arjuna
known several times; but when Kṛṣṇa told
them that Arjuna had done the right thing,
they were pacified 1. 213. 2-11; Kṛṣṇa with
Vṛṣṇis and others went to the Khāṇḍava-
prastha to attend the marriage of Subhadrā
with Arjuna; they took with them large
number of nuptial gifts ({%haraṇaṃ bahu%});
they were received by Nakula and Saha-
deva; the illustrious Vṛṣṇis ({%vṛṣṇicakraṃ%}
{%samṛddhimat%}) entered Khāṇḍavaprastha;
Yudhiṣṭhira received the seniors among
Vṛṣṇis with honours according to the rules
and following the actual practice (?) ({%prati-%}
{%jagrāha satkārair yathāvidhi yathopagam%});
he honoured some Vṛṣṇi-chiefs as elders,
some as friends; he greeted some with
affection and was himself greeted by some

{%kaiś cid apy abhivāditaḥ //%}) 1. 213. 23-24,
29, 31, 34, 38-39; after receiving their
[Page867-b+ 40]
gifts, Yudhiṣṭhira honoured the great
warriors of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas ({%vṛṣṇy-%}
{%andhakamahārathān%}); the best among the
Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas ({%vṛṣṇyandhakotta-%}
{%māḥ%}) lived happily with Kurus and enjoyed
with them great drinking bouts ({%mahā-%}
{%pānair … vijahruḥ kuruvṛṣṇayaḥ%}); then,
after many days, the Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka
warriors ({%uttamavīryās te%}), led by Bala-
rāma, returned to Dvārakā taking with
them bright jewels given to them by
Kurus 1. 213. 52-56; (7) Vṛṣṇi princes
({%vṛṣṇīnāṃ … kumārā … %}) were among those
who waited on Dharmarāja in his Sabhā 2.
4. 26; (8) They were taught the science
of archery by Arjuna ({%kumārā … vṛṣṇi-%}
{%nandanāḥ%}) 2. 4. 29; (9) Vṛṣṇis fled
from Mathurā and settled down at Kuśa-
sthalī in the west; they fortified the new
settlement in such a way as to make it
difficult to be captured even by gods; even
women could fight and hold it against
the attack ({%striyo 'pi yasyāṃ yudhyeyuḥ%}
{%kiṃ punar vṛṣṇipuṃgavāḥ%} 2. 13. 51);
Vṛṣṇis lived there without fear from any
quarter ({%akutobhayāḥ%}); although powerful,
they had allied themselves with Pāṇḍavas
because of their relationship ({%sāmarthya-%}
{%vantaḥ sambandhād bhavantaṃ samupā-%}
{%śritāḥ%}); Cārudeṣṇa and all other Vṛṣṇi
heroes though free from grief, lived at
Kuśasthalī still remembering the Madhya-
deśa (where they formerly lived) ({%smaranto%}
{%madhyamaṃ deśaṃ vṛṣṇimadhye gata-%}
{%vyathāḥ%}) 2. 13. 53, 59; (10) Jarāsandha
was neglected by Vṛṣṇis, though strong,
out of considerations of policy ({%balibhiḥ%}
{% … vṛṣṇibhiś ca … nītihetor upekṣitaḥ%}) 2.
17. 27; (11) Vṛṣṇis arrived at Khāṇḍava-
prastha for the Rājasūya of Yudhiṣṭhira
[Page868-a+ 40]
2. 31. 16; (12) Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas
did not pay tribute to Yudhiṣṭhira for
Rājasūya because of their friendly relations
with Pāṇḍavas ({%sakhyenāndhakavṛṣṇayaḥ%})
2. 48. 42; however, Vārṣṇeyas are said to
have brought for Yudhiṣṭhira many kinds
of tribute ({%vārṣṇeyān hārahūṇāṃś ca%}
{% … balyarthaṃ dadatas tasmai nānārūpān%}
{%anekaśaḥ%}) but were stopped at the gate 2.
47. 19-20, 25; the tribute is described in 2.
47. 21-25 (since Vārṣṇeyas are here listed
along with Cīnas, Hūṇas, Śakas, Oḍras,
forest-dwellers, and Hārahūṇas, are these
Vārṣṇeyas different from Vṛṣṇis who formed
a section of the Yādavas and did not pay
tribute ?): (13) Śiśupāla instigated the
kings assembled for the Rājasūya to fight
with Vṛṣṇis and Pāṇḍavas 2. 36. 14; (14)
Vidura warned Kauravas that Vṛṣṇis would
never forgive the hardship suffered by Drau-
padī in the Sabhā ({%tasyāḥ … parikleśaṃ%}
{%na kṣaṃsyante … /vṛṣṇayo vā maheṣvāsāḥ%})
2. 72. 29; (15) Hearing that Pāṇḍavas
had gone into exile, Vṛṣṇis, Bhojas, and
Andhakas went to meet them in the
Dvaitavana (3. 12. 68); they sat around
Yudhiṣṭhira, blamed Kauravas and won-
dered what they could do (to help them)
3. 13. 1, 3-4; (16) Draupadī complained
to Kṛṣṇa that Kauravas had desired to
reduce her to the status of a {%dāsī%} although
Vṛṣṇis were alive ({%dāsībhāvena bhoktuṃ%}
{%mām īṣus te madhusūdana / jīvatsu … atha%}
{%vṛṣṇiṣu%}) 3. 13. 56; 5. 80. 25; (17) When
Śālva attacked Dvārakā in the absence of
Kṛṣṇa, young Vṛṣṇi heroes fought with him
({%bālakair vṛṣṇipuṃgavaiḥ%}); Śālva killed
many of the excellent Vṛṣṇi heroes ({%vṛṣṇi-%}
{%pravīrāṃs tān bālān hatvā%}) 3. 15. 6-7;
during Śālva's attack on Dvārakā drinking
[Page868-b+ 40]
liquor was prohibited; Vṛṣṇis and Andha-
kas had to remain alert apprehending
Śālva might attack them when they were
drunk ({%pramatteṣv abhighātaṃ hi kuryāt%}
{% … iti kṛtvāpramattās te sarve vṛṣṇy-%}
{%andhakāḥ sthitāḥ //%}) 3. 16. 12-13; it was
then ruled that no one in the town of
Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas could leave or enter
the town without valid permit ({%na cāmudro%}
{%'bhiniryāti na cāmudraḥ praveśyate / vṛṣṇya-%}
{%ndhakapure%}) 3. 16. 19; when the youthful
Vṛṣṇi princes saw Śālva's army attacking
Dvārakā, they came out and fought with
the opponents ({%kumārā vṛṣṇinandanāḥ%})
3. 17. 8; when Pradyumna swooned, the
army of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas raised a
cry of grief; when Pradyumna regained
consciousness he blamed his charioteer for
removing his chariot away from the battle-
field for that was not the battle-{%dharma%}
of Vṛṣṇ warriors ({%naiṣa vṛṣṇipravīrāṇām%}
{%āhave dharma ucyate%}) 3. 19. 1-2, 5; he
told the charioteer that one who left the
battlefield was not born in the family of
Vṛṣṇis ({%na sa vṛṣṇikule jāto yo vai tyajati%}
{%saṃgaram%}), nor he who killed one fallen
on the ground or who had surrendered,
or a woman, an old man or a child, or
one who was without a chariot, who was
shattered, and whose weapons were broken;
he reminded the charioteer that he (the
charioteer) knew what the {%dharma%} of
Vṛṣṇis was in battles, and since he knew
the entire code of conduct of Vṛṣṇis en-
gaged in fighting he should not have taken
Pradyumna away form battlefield; ({%dhar-%}

ed what the women of Vṛṣṇi heroes would
[Page869-a+ 40]
say to him when he met them 3. 19. 21;
Pradyumna asked his charioteer how he
could face Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis who
always vied with him ({%mayā spardhanti%}
{%satataṃ%}) 3. 19. 28; the charioteer in reply
told Pradyumna that he was conversant
with the war (conduct) of Vṛṣṇis (and
he defended his action) ({%yuddhajñaś cāsmi%}
{%vṛṣṇīnām%}) 3. 20. 2; Śālva tormented by
Vṛṣṇis rode his Saubha to rise up in
the sky and left Dvārakā 3. 20. 27; when
Kṛṣṇa returned to Dvārakā he was sur-
prised to see the town of Vṛṣṇis with men
and women extremely uneasy ({%asvastha-%}
{%naranārīkam idaṃ vṛṣṇipuraṃ bhṛśam%}) 3.
21. 4; Kṛṣṇa then spoke to Āhuka, Vasu-
deva and Vṛṣṇi heroes asking them to
remain alert ({%apramādaḥ sadā kāryo%}); he
announced his decision to attack Śālva
which delighted Vṛṣṇis; comforted, they
asked him to kill the enemies and blessed
him 3. 21. 7-11; (18) Dhṛtarāṣṭra feared
that Vṛṣṇi archers and spirited Pāñcālas,
led by Kṛṣṇa, would burn the army of
Kauravas 3. 48. 6; he told Saṃjaya that
it was not possible even for mountains
to withstand the velocity (of the attack)
of Vṛṣṇis when led by Rāma and Kṛṣṇa
({%vṛṣṇīnām … /na śakyaḥ sahituṃ vegaḥ%})
3. 48. 7; (19) When Vṛṣṇis went to
Prabhāsa to meet the Pāṇḍavas during
the period of their exile, they found
them smeared with dirt resting on bare
ground; seeing them, Vṛṣṇis were filled
with sorrow and cried loudly; Yudhiṣṭhira
approached Vṛṣṇis and honoured them as
they deserved; they too in return honoured
Pāṇḍavas and sat around them 3. 118. 15,
18-21; Janamejaya asked Vaiśaṃpāyana to
tell him the details of the talks between
[Page869-b+ 40]
Vṛṣṇis, sitting around, and Pāṇḍavas at
Prabhāsa 3. 119. 1-3; Sātyaki suggested to
Balarāma that he should permit the army
of Daśārhas to march against Duryodhana
so that he would perish when overtaken
by the army of Vṛṣṇis; he also said that
the army consisting of principal Kṣatriya
warriors of Vṛṣṇis, Bhojas and Andhakas
should kill the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra and
enhance its fame ({%kṣatriyaśūrasenā loke%}
{%yaśaḥ sphītam upākarotu%}) 3. 120. 5, 19;
(20) Kṛṣṇa told Draupadī that her
sons while they were in the town of
Vṛṣṇis (Dvārakā) they were not jealous
of gods ({%tavātmajā vṛṣṇipuraṃ praviśya%}
{%na daivatebhyaḥ spṛhayanti kṛṣṇe%}) 3. 180.
25; Satyabhāmā assured Draupadī that
Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis had the same affec-
tion for her sons as for Pradyumna 3. 224.
14; (21) Draupadī warned Jayadratha
that if he insisted on abducting her, Vṛṣṇi
heroes led by Kṛṣṇa, would chase him
({%vṛṣṇivīrā … padavīṃ careyuḥ%}) 3. 252. 16
(Nī. on 3. 268. 14 (in another context)
{%padavīṃ caretāṃ anveṣaṇaṃ kurutaḥ%});
(22) Vṛṣṇis, Bhojas and Andhakas went
to Upaplavya to attend the marriage of
Abhimanyu 4. 67. 14, 24; Vṛṣṇis, Andhakas
and Bhojas returned to Dvārakā after the
marriage 5. 7. 1; (23) Saṃjaya advised
Yudhiṣṭhira that it was more beneficial for
him to live by begging in the kingdom of
Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas than get back the
kingdom by resorting to war ({%bhaikṣya-%}
{%caryāṃ andhakavṛṣṇirājye śreyo manye na%}
{%tu yuddhena rājyam%}) 5. 27. 2; (24) An-
dhakas, Vārṣṇeyas and Bhojas followed
the advice of Kṛṣṇa and therefore they
could restrain the enemies and delight their
friends ({%andhakāś ca vārṣṇeyabhojāḥ%});
[Page870-a+ 40]
Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas, led by Kṛṣṇa, were
like Indra ({%kṛṣṇapraṇītāḥ sarva evendra-%}

Ugrasena (Kaṃsa) once shone amongst
Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas ({%vṛṣṇyandhakānāṃ%}
{%madhyagataṃ tapantam%}) 5. 47. 72; (26)
Once Nārada advised Vṛṣṇis that they
should do their duty ({%tasmāt karmaiva%}

(27) Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas could not be
subjugated by Jarāsandha either due to
the policy adopted by them or due to
sheer luck ({%nayenāndhakavṛṣṇayaḥ / te na%}

Vṛṣṇis in all calamities ({%sarvāsv āpatsu%})
5. 70. 4; (29) According to Duryodhana
if Kṛṣṇa was arrested Vṛṣṇis would be
under his control ({%tasmin baddhe bhavi-%}
{%ṣyanti vṛṣṇayaḥ … vidheyā me%}) 5. 86. 14;
(30) When Kṛṣṇa mounted the chariot to
go to the Sabhā of Kauravas he was pro-
tected by Vṛṣṇis whose great chariot-fighters
followed him ({%pṛṣṭhato 'nuyayuḥ%}); when
he entered the Sabhā they walked behind
him ({%āsan kṛṣṇasya pṛṣṭhataḥ%}) 5. 92. 14,
17, 33; (31) All Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis
lived happily together when the Yādavas
abandoned Kaṃsa in the interest of the
family ({%saṃbhūya sukhaṃ edhante%}) 5. 126.
39; (32) Kṛṣṇa told Duryodhana that
he was not alone in the Sabhā; Andhakas
and Vṛṣṇis were with him; and when he
laughed to show the great miracle ({%mahad%}
{%āścaryaṃ%} 5. 129. 14) Vṛṣṇis and others,
ready with weapons ({%samudyatamahā-%}
[Page870-b+ 40]
{%yudhāḥ%}), were there in front of him 5.
129. 3, 8-9; (33) Kṛṣṇa asked Karṇa to
recognize Vṛṣṇis who were his kin from
the mother's side (viz. Kuntī) ({%mātṛpakṣe%}
{%ca vṛṣṇayaḥ / dvau pakṣāv abhijānīhi%}); in
that case Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis would
follow him 5. 138. 10, 13, 23; (34) Yudhi-
ṣṭhira settled down in his camp at Kuru-
kṣetra along with Vṛṣṇis ({%vṛṣnibhiś caiva%}
{% … vṛtam%}) 5. 150. 2; (35) Balarāma came
to Pāṇḍavas along with Vṛṣṇi chiefs ({%vṛṣṇi-%}
{%mukhyair abhigataiḥ%}) 5. 154. 17; but he
decided not to take part in the war from
any side and left for pilgrimage along with
Vṛṣṇis 9. 34. 1, 5, 12; (cf. 5. 154. 34);
(36) Before the start of the war in the
camp of Kauravas, Bṛhadbala along with
the great warriors of Andhakas, Vṛṣṇis
and Bhojas stood guard on the right side
of the army ({%balaṃ tvadīyaṃ dakṣiṇato%}
{%'bhipāti%}) 6. 20. 14; (37) On the ninth
day of the war, at night, Pāṇḍavas sat
down to take counsel with Vṛṣṇis ({%vṛṣṇi-%}
{%bhiḥ saha / … mantrāya samupāviśan%}) 6.
103. 10; (38) In the estimate of Vṛṣṇis,
Cekitāna was a match for a hundred
warriors in battle ({%śatād viśiṣṭaṃ yaṃ%}
{%yuddhe samapaśyanta vṛṣṇayaḥ%}) 7. 9. 50;
(39) Droṇa, in order to encourage Jaya-
dratha said that, after all, Vṛṣṇis and the
rest were not eternal and that some day
they (and by turn they all) were going to
die ({%vṛṣṇayo 'nye ca mānavāḥ / … adhruvā%}

{%gamiṣyāmaḥ%}) 7. 52. 30-31; (40) Subhadrā
wondered who could have killed Abhi-

protect him; she pitied the heroism of
Vṛṣṇi warriors ({%nātheṣu … vṛṣṇivīreṣu;%}
{%dhig vīryaṃ vṛṣṇivīrāṇām%}) 7. 55. 9, 12;
[Page871-a+ 40]
(41) On the fourteenth day, Saṃjaya told
Dhṛtarāṣṭra that Pāṇḍavas, Vṛṣṇis and
others would blame him for the confusion
in his mind ({%te buddhivyabhīcāram upa-%}
{%lapsyanti%}) 7. 62. 7; the same day, Yudhi-
ṣṭhira remembered that Arjuna, to praise
Sātyaki, had told him in Dvaitavana that
he would need Sātyaki's help even though
Vṛṣṇis, led by Kṛṣṇa, were ready to help him
7. 85. 54, 58-60; Bhūriśravas wondered how
Arjuna could look upon Vṛṣṇis and Andha-
kas who, by very nature were despicable, as
authority (while deciding what was proper
or improper in war) ({%prakṛtyaiva vigar-%}
{%hitāḥ / vṛṣṇyandhakāḥ kathaṃ pārtha pra-%}
{%māṇaṃ bhavatā kṛtāḥ //%}) 7. 118. 15; (42)
During the night war (14th-15th day),
Karṇa assured Duryodhana that he would
defeat Vṛṣṇis and the rest 7. 133. 11; after
the death of Droṇa, Sātyaki told Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna that he deserved to be expelled
(from the war) by Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis
since he did a vile act and yet praised
himself ({%yāpyas tvam asi … sarvaiś cāpy-%}
{%andhakavṛṣṇibhiḥ%}) 7. 169. 11; (43) Saha-
deva told Sātyaki that just as Pāṇḍavas
had no friends other than Andhakas and
Vṛṣṇis, they too had no friends other than
Pāṇḍavas 7. 169. 48-49; Pāñcālas too
had no friends better than Pāṇḍavas and
Vṛṣṇis 7. 169. 50; (44) On the fifteenth
day, when the Pāṇḍava army was being
burnt by the Nārāyaṇāstra, Yudhiṣṭhira
advised Sātyaki to leave the battle-field
along with Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas 7. 170.
26; (45) On the seventeenth day, at
night ({%niśi%} 8. 1. 25), Dhṛtarāṣṭra while
lamenting the death of Karṇa, told Saṃjaya
that Karṇa, depending on the strength of
his arms, never thought highly of Vṛṣṇis
[Page871-b+ 40]
({%nāmanyata vai nityam … na vṛṣṇīn api … %}
{%svabāhubalam āśritaḥ //%}) 8. 5. 15; (46)
After the fall of Duryodhana, when Bala-
rāma, in anger, left for Dvārakā, Pāñcālas
and Vārṣṇeyas were disheartened ({%pāñcālāś%}
{%ca savārṣṇeyāḥ … nātipramanaso 'bhavan%})
9. 59. 27; (47) Kṛṣṇa narrated to Yudhi-
ṣṭhira that Aśvatthāman had once come to
Dvārakā where he was highly honoured by
Vṛṣṇis ({%vṛṣṇibhiḥ paramārcitaḥ%}) 10. 12. 11;
Kṛṣṇa told Aśvatthāman that he was never
before requested to part with his {%cakra%} by
any one of the great warriors among Vṛṣṇis
and Andhakas (as Aśvatthāman did) 10.
12. 33; (48) Kṛṣṇa told Gāndhārī that
there was no one else except himself who
could extirpate the clan of Vṛṣṇis ({%saṃ-%}
{%hartā vṛṣṇicakrasya%}) 11. 25. 44; (49)
While repenting the loss of life in war,
Yudhiṣṭhira said to Arjuna that if Pāṇḍa-
vas, instead of waging war, had chosen to
beg in the town of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas
they would not have killed the males in the
army of their kinsmen and would not have
met with the misfortune ({%yad bhaikṣam%}

{%jñātīn niṣpuruṣān kṛtvā nemāṃ prāpsyāma%}

addressing Vyāsa pitied the plight of war
widows who would curse Pāṇḍavas along
with Vṛṣṇis 12. 33. 8; (51) Kṛṣṇa told
Arjuna that a very long time had elapsed
since he was with Baladeva and other Vṛṣṇi
chiefs in Dvārakā ({%vṛṣṇipuṃgavān%}) and he
would therefore like to return to Dvārakā
14. 15. 20; Arjuna assured him that he
would soon meet them; Yudhiṣṭhira re-
quested Kṛṣṇa to return to Hāstinapura
for the Aśvamedha after meeting Vṛṣṇis 14.
51. 23, 46; (52) When Kṛṣṇa returned
[Page872-a+ 40]
to Dvārakā, Vṛṣṇi heroes were celebrating
the festival of the Raivataka mountain
({%vihāro vṛṣṇivīrāṇām mahe raivatakasya%}
{%ha%}) 14. 58. 13; Bhojas, Andhakas and
Vṛṣṇis received Kṛṣṇa on the Raivataka;
Kṛṣṇa honoured them and enquired about
the welfare of Vṛṣṇis who sat around him
({%sa tān abhyarcya medhāvī pṛṣṭvā ca%}
{%kuśalaṃ tadā%}) 14. 58. 17-19; (53) On
hearing the war account from Kṛṣṇa, Vṛṣṇis
experienced the feelings of grief, pain,
as well as delight ({%duḥkhaharṣaparikleśā%}
{%vṛṣṇīnām abhavaṃs tadā%}) 14. 59. 36; (54)
Kṛṣṇa, along with Vṛṣṇis, went to Hāstina-
pura for the horse sacrifice; when Vṛṣṇi
heroes lived there, Parikṣit was born,
Abhimanyu had told Uttarā that her son
would learn from Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas
the science of archery, the different {%astras,%}
and the entire science of morals ({%gatvā%}

Parikṣit was restored to life by Kṛṣṇa,
Vṛṣṇi chiefs ({%vṛṣṇiśārdūlāḥ%}) gave Uttarā
many jewels as gift; when Pāṇḍavas arrived
at the place where Parikṣit was born,
Vṛṣṇi chiefs ({%vṛṣṇipuṃgavāḥ%}) came out
to welcome them (14. 69. 8-9, 13);
Pāṇḍavas, along with Vṛṣṇis ({%vṛṣṇibhiḥ%}
{%saha%}), entered Hāstinapura; when Vyāsa
arrived, Kuru chiefs (Pāṇḍavas) sat near
him along with Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka
heroes ({%saha vṛṣṇyandhakavyāghraiḥ%}) 14.
70. 2, 11; (56) The Aśvamedha horse
went to Dvāravatī which was protected by
Vṛṣṇi heroes ({%vṛṣṇivīra-%}) 14. 84. 13; when
the horse sacrifice was in progress, Kṛṣṇa,
with Vṛṣṇis reached Hāstinapura 14. 88. 4;
(57) Yudhiṣṭhira told Kuntī that only the
[Page872-b+ 40]
Vṛṣṇi circle ({%vṛṣṇicakram%}) had survived
the war due to the favour of Kṛṣṇa 15. 44.
34; (58) Janamejaya asked Vaiśaṃpāyana
how were Andhakas, Vṛṣṇis and Bhojas
destroyed in the presence of Vāsudeva
and who pronounced the curse on them
due to which they perished 16. 2. 1, 3;
Vaiśaṃpāyana then told him that thirtysix
years (after the coronation of Yudhiṣṭhira)
Vṛṣṇis misbehaved and, as dictated by
Kāla, they killed each other with pestle;
the sages (Viśvāmitra, Kaṇva and Nārada)
pronounced a curse to the effect that Sāmba
would give birth to an iron pestle for the
destruction of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas ({%vṛṣṇy-%}
{%andhakavināśāya%}); that pestle would wipe
out the Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas who were ill-
behaved, cruel and naughty, and the entire
race except Balarāma and Kṛṣṇa ({%yena%}

happened, he told Vṛṣṇis that the curse
would prove true ({%bhavitavyaṃ tathā%}) 16.
2. 2, 8-9, 13; the next day Sāmba gave
birth to a pestle for the destruction of
Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas; when the matter was
reported to Ugrasena he prohibited fer-
mentation of liquor in all the houses of
Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas ({%adyaprabhṛti sar-%}

15, 18; (59) When Vṛṣṇis and Andha-
kas were trying to protect themselves,
Kāla constantly visited their houses; a
certain bald, fierce man surveyed their
houses and disappeared; day after day
strong winds blew to foretell the de-
struction of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas; day and
night, {%sārikās%} produced shrill, unceasing
[Page873-a+ 39]
sounds in the houses of Vṛṣṇis; pale pigeons
with red feet, inspired by Kāla, moved in
the houses of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas; there
occurred many other bad omens; asses with
shrill voices responded to the sound pro-
duced by Pāñcajanya ({%evaṃ prayatamānā-%}

except Rāma and Kṛṣṇa, were not ashamed
to commit sins; the rest hated Brāhmaṇas,
fore-fathers and gods, disrespected elders
in general; women and men transgressed
rules of morality ({%patnyaḥ patīn vyucca-%}
{%ranta patnīś ca patayas tathā%}) 16. 3.
8-9; (60) Vṛṣṇi women dreamt at night
that a black woman with white teeth,
laughing, ran around Dvārakā robbing
them and men dreamt that fierce demons
deprived them of their ornaments, {%chatras%}
flag-staffs and armours; the {%cakra%} given to
Kṛṣṇa by Agni rose up to the sky within
the sight of Vṛṣṇis ({%vṛṣṇīnāṃ paśyatām%});
the four horses took the chariot upwards
and the Apsarases took away, day and
night, the flag-staffs of Balarāma and Kṛṣṇa
and asked Vṛṣṇis to proceed on a {%tīrtha-%}
{%yātrā%} 16. 4. 1-5; (61) The great Vṛṣṇi
and Andhaka heroes desired to go for a
{%tīrthayātrā%} along with their women; they
took with them eatables (meat) and drinks
(liquors) of different kinds and set out
of the city 16. 4. 6-8; (62) Vṛṣṇi and
Andhaka heroes, overpowered by Kāla,
saw Uddhava deserting them; Kṛṣṇa knew
the iminent destruction of Vṛṣṇis and
[Page873-b+ 40]
hence he did not object to Uddhava's
leaving Vṛṣṇis ({%kālaparītās te vṛṣṇy-%}

(cf. 16. 4. 34-35); (64) Brooding over the
destruction of Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis, Kṛṣṇa
thought it was time for him to depart
({%sa cintayāno 'ndhakavṛṣṇināśam … mene%}

(65) Dāruka went to Kurus (i. e. Pāṇḍa-

killings of Vṛṣṇis with pestles ({%ācaṣṭa mau-%}

Andhakas but now bereft of Vṛṣṇi chiefs

Dvārakā about the calamity that overtook
Vṛṣṇis ({%vṛṣṇīnāṃ vaiśasaṃ mahat%}) 16. 7.
14; (69) Vasudeva told Arjuna that
Vṛṣṇis were destroyed due to the miscon-
duct of Pradyumna and Sātyaki; the two
started the destruction of Vṛṣṇis ({%tayor%}

he would take with him the women of
Vṛṣṇīs as well as their old men and
children ({%vṛṣṇidārāṃs tu bālavṛddhāṃs%}
{%tathaiva ca%}); he informed Dāruka that
he would like to meet the ministers of
Vṛṣṇi heroes ({%amātyān vṛṣṇivīrāṇām%}); he
assured the gathering assembled in the
Sudharmā Hall that he himself would take
with him the Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka people
to Indraprastha ({%ahaṃ neṣye vṛṣṇyandhaka-%}

were destroyed; he was grieved to see
them dead and did whatever was necessary
on that occasion ({%prāptakālaṃ cakāra%}

day after the funeral rites of Vasudeva and
others, Arjuna started for Indraprastha;
Vṛṣṇi women, weeping and grieved, followed
him in carriages drawn by horses, bulls,
asses and camels ({%pāṇḍavaḥ / saptame%}

(Kṛṣṇa) left Dvārakā following Vajra

left in great hurry crying ‘oh! this was
our Fate!’ ({%tūrṇāt tūrṇataram jagmur%}
{%aho daivam iti bruvan // %}) 16. 8. 32-41;
(73) While Arjuna was taking Vṛṣṇis

(Dasyus) in order to deprive them of
their wealth ({%abhyadhāvanta vṛṣṇīnāṃ taṃ%}

riding elephants, horses and chariots, were
unable to check the robbers carrying away

directions ({%kalatrasya bahutvāt tu saṃ-%}

destruction of Vṛṣṇi heroes at Prabhāsa
caused by the curse of Brāhmaṇas; five
hundred thousand brave Bhoja, Vṛṣṇi and
Andhaka warriors had killed one another
with {%erakā%} grass; he also told him that
thousands of Vṛṣṇi women were abducted
by Ābhīras of Pañcanada in spite of him

16. 9. 8-11, 16; (76) Vyāsa consoled
Arjuna by saying that the great warriors
of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas were burnt by
the curse of Brāhmaṇas and therefore
Arjuna should not be grieved over their
destruction; what had happened was bound
to happen for that was dictated by fate for
the magnanimous (Vṛṣṇis) ({%bhavitavyaṃ%}
