[Page299-b+ 39]
the Udaya mountain and the moon entering
the sun; at that point when the Raudra
{%muhūrta%} commenced on the new moon day
he saw the battle raging between gods and
demons on the Udaya mountain ({%amāvāsyāṃ%}

{%devāsuraṃ ca saṃgrāmaṃ so 'paśyad udaye%}
{%girau%}) 3. 213. 26-27. {@B.@} Similes: (1)
Śālva mounted on his elephant appeared like
the sun on the Udaya mountain at the end
of the night 9. 19. 4; (2) Arjuna mounted
his excellent chariot as does the sun the
Udaya 7. 60. 16; (3) Karṇa, shining with
his white splendour ({%karṇam … śvetaccha-%}
{%vivirājitam%}), appeared like the sun beautify-
ing the Udaya mountain 8. 43. 38; (4) The
elephant, fierce and properly equipped, on
which Bhīma had mounted, looked like a man-
sion on the topmost part of the Udaya where
the sun had arisen ({%udayāgryabhavanaṃ%}
{%yathābhyuditabhāskaram%}) 8. 8. 22; (5)
Kṛṣṇa, with the Kaustubha jewel shining on
his chest, looked like the Udaya mountain
with the rising sun 12. 45. 15; (6) Duryo-
dhana and Śalya received the attacking
warriors like the Asta and the Udaya moun-
tains receiving the huge clouds 9. 15. 31;
(7) Just as an object on the Udaya moun-
tain shines due to the proximity of the sun
similarly a person of a lower order becomes
bright due to association with the people of
the higher order ({%yathodayagirau dravyaṃ%}
