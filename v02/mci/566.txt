{@Vasūnāṃ praharaṇam@}¦ nt.: The weapon
of the Vasus, not named.
<div n="P">When Garuḍa flew up from the moun-
tain top to fetch the Soma from the heaven,
bad omens occurred for the gods, one of them
being that the weapon of the Vasus clashed
with that of the Rudras, the Ādityas, the
Sādhyas, the Maruts and the other hosts of
gods ({%ye cānye devatāgaṇāḥ%}); such a
thing had never happened before 1. 26.
29-30. [See {@Vasūnām astram@}]
