{@Vajra<sup>2</sup>@}¦ m.: Name of a {%vyūha%} (a parti-
cular arrangement of the army).
{@A.@} Origin: It was designed by Indra
({%vihitaṃ vajrapāṇinā%}) 6. 19. 7. {@B.@} Des-
cription: highly invincible ({%paramadur-%}
{%jaya%}) 6. 19. 7; ({%ajeyo mānuṣe loke%}) 6. 19.
35; immovable ({%acala%}) 6. 19. 7; difficult
to penetrate ({%durbhida%}), watching on all
sides ({%sarvatomukha%}), and terrible ({%ghora%})
6. 19. 34. {@C.@} Use in the epic war:
(1) Arjuna arranged the Pāṇḍava army
according to this Vyūha on the first day of
the war 6. 19. 6-7, 35; Bhīma led it
({%bhīmaseno 'graṇīs teṣām%}) 6. 19. 18,
({%dṛṣṭvāgrato bhīmasenam%}) 6. 19. 44,
({%bhīmaseno … pracakarṣa mahat sainyam%})
6. 19. 32; 6. 19. 8, 9; also in the forefront
stood Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Nakula, Sahadeva, and
Dhṛṣtaketu; Nakula and Sahadeva acted as
the protectors of the wheels of Bhīma's
chariot ({%cakrarakṣau%} 6. 19. 20), and the
sons of Draupadī and Abhimanyu protected
Bhīma from behind ({%pṛṣṭhagopāḥ%} 6. 19. 20);
Dhṛṣṭadyumna, helped by the Prabhadrakas,
offered protection to all of them (6. 19. 21);
the king (Virāṭa ?), surrounded by an army,
{%akṣauhiṇī%} strong, together with his brothers
and sons guarded them from behind;
Śikhaṇḍin, guarded by Arjuna, followed them;
Yuyudhāna (Sātyaki) protected Arjuna
from behind ({%pṛṣṭhagopa%}) and Yudhā-
manyu and Uttamaujas acted as his wheel-
protectors ({%cakrarakṣau%}); Yudhiṣṭhira, with
elephants, took position in the middle; the
Pāñcāla king Yajñasena with an army,
{%akṣauhiṇī%} strong, marched behind Virāṭa;
[Page137-b+ 40]
Dhṛṣṭadyumna, having moved from
his position, with his brothers and sons,
protected Yudhiṣṭhira from behind; hundreds
and thousands of foot-soldiers moved in the
front to protect Bhīmasena, while ten thou-
sand elephants followed Yudhiṣṭhira 6. 19.
18-31; according to 6. 22. 1-6, where the
name of the Vyūha is not mentioned but
the description of which apparently applies to
the arrangement of the Pāṇḍava army on the
first day, Yudhiṣṭhira himself directed the
contingents ({%anīkāni%}) of his army to counter
the Vyūha (Sarvatobhadra) of Bhīṣma;
Śikhaṇḍin's contingent stood in the middle,
protected by Arjuna (also 6. 22. 14); Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna's contingent was protected by Bhīma
himself; the contingent on the right side of the
Vyūha ({%anīkaṃ dakṣiṇam%}) was protected by
Yuyudhāna (Sātyaki); Yudhiṣṭhira's chariot
was stationed in the midst of elephants;
Bhīma, along with Nakula and Sahadeva, is
said to be the guard of the chariot of the hero
({%vīrarathasya goptā%} i. e. Arjuna ? Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna ?), but his position seems to be in
the front of the army ({%senāgragatam%}) 6.
22. 12-13; in many respects, this description
of the Vyūha agrees with that of the Vajra
given above (6. 19. 18-31); (2) On the
seventh day of the war Yudhiṣṭhira himself
used the Vajravyūha for his army (of which
no details are available) to counter the
Maṇḍalavyūha of the Kaurava army 6. 77. 21.
