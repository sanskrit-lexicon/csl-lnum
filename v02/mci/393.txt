Sumukha was, Mātali chose him as his son-in-

101. 21, 25, 26; Nārada approached Āryaka,
Sumukha's grand-father, and told him what
Mātali had in mind; Āryaka was told that
although Sumukha had no father he was
chosen by Mātali on account of his good quali-
ties 5. 101. 6, 10; Āryaka was happy to hear
[Page073-b+ 40]
the proposal but he was distressed because
Garuḍa had announced his intention to eat up
Sumukha after a month 5. 102. 15; 5. 103. 5;
the threat was bound to come true as Garuḍa
wanted to feed his large progeny by killing
Sumukha 5. 102. 16; 5. 103. 5; Mātali then
proposed to take Sumukha with him to meet
Indra and make effort to prolong the remaining
life-span of Sumukha and thwart Garuḍa in
carrying out his threat 5. 102. 17-21; Viṣṇu,
who happened to be present when all met
Indra, asked Indra to give {%amṛta%} to Sumukha
and make him (immortal) like other gods;
Viṣṇu desired Sumukha and the rest to get
what they wanted; Indra, however, asked
Viṣṇu himself to give {%amṛta%} to Sumukha;
when asked by Viṣṇu again, Indra gave only
long life ({%āyur uttamam%} 5. 102. 27) to
Sumukha but not {%amṛta;%} on obtaining the
boon Sumukha's face shone with brilliance
({%labdhvā varaṃ tu sumukhaḥ sumukhaḥ%}
{%saṃbabhūva ha%} 5. 102. 28); having obtained
wife as desired Sumukha went home 5. 102.
23-28; Garuḍa was extremely angry to
know that he was deprived of Sumukha; he
blamed Indra for acting as he willed and
announced that since Sumukha was no longer
available to him he would not kill any other
serpent 5. 103. 1, 2, 6, 15.
