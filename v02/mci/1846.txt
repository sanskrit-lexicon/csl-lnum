{@Acyutasthala@}¦ nt.: Name of a town.
<div n="P">A place in the Āraṭṭa (Bāhlīka) coun-
try; one who stays there (long) cannot go
to heaven; hence one should not stay there
for more than a day—this is what a Brāh-
maṇa told in the assembly of the Kurus
({%yad anyo 'py uktavān sabhyo brāhmaṇaḥ%}
{%kurusaṃ sadi // … proṣya cāpy acyutasthale /%}
{% … kathaṃ svargaṃ gamiṣyati // … āraṭṭā%}
{%nāma bāhlīkā na teṣv āryo dvyahaṃ vaset%}
{% //%}) 8. 30. 41-43; the place also mentioned
in what a Piśācī said to a Brāhmaṇī (?)
who came to stay at Raupyā with her sons;
this was told by Lomaśa to Yudhiṣṭhira
when he wanted to recite the {%anuvaṃśa%}
stanzas about Raupyā; according to the
Piśācī no one who had stayed at Acyuta-
sthala was supposed to stay near Raupyā
for more than one night ({%atrānuvaṃśaṃ%}
{%paṭhataḥ śṛṇu me kurunandana / … piśācī%}
{%yad abhāṣata / … uṣitvā cācyutasthale / … %}
{%ekarātram uṣitveha dvitīyāṃ yadi vatsyasi /%}
{%etad vai te divā vṛttaṃ rātrau vṛttam ato%}
[Page508-a+ 38]
{%'nyathā //%}) 3. 129. 8-10; (according to the
{%prāñcaḥ,%} whose view is cited by Nī. on Bom.
Ed. 3. 129. 9, one could stay at Raupyā even
after staying at Acyutasthala if he had
performed the prescribed {%prāyaścitta%} viz.
the {%prājāpatya vrata;%} according to these
{%prāñcaḥ,%} Acyutasthala was the village where
people born of mixed marriages lived
({%acyutasthalākhye saṃkarajānāṃ grāme%});
according to others, however, who under-
stood the word in good light, Acyutasthala
meant the subtle body ({%liṅgaśarīra%}) and
{%uṣitvā%} meant by being near the {%sūtrātman%}
{%(sūtrātmānam upāsya)%}).
