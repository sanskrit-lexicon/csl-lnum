(i) Sages and gods pay homage to Nārāyaṇa
on the river Gaṅgā 3. 88. 18; (ii) Gaṅgā
is listed by Mārkaṇḍeya among rivers famous
as mothers of fire-hearths, i. e. sacrifices were
performed on their banks ({%gaṅgā ca … /etā%}

[Page328-a+ 40]
(vi) The narration of the great importance
and virtues of the Gaṅgā is called a holy
Itihāsa containing the praise of the river; one
who recites it, or listens to it, is freed of all
sins ({%itihāsam imaṃ puṇyaṃ śṛṇuyād yaḥ%}

Virtues of the river Gaṅgā are countless;
no one can fully describe or determine them
({%vaktuṃ śakyaṃ neha gaṅgājalānāṃ guṇā-%}

support to those who are without it 13. 27. 44;
Lomaśa invoked the blessings of the Gaṅgā,
besides those of Varuṇa, Yama, and the
Yamunā, on Yudhiṣṭhira and requested her
to protect him from the mountains which he
was about to enter while on his way to the
Gandhamādana 3. 140. 13-14; (ix) Grief
due to separation from the Gaṅgā more
unbearable than from near relatives or wealth;
on the other hand, just the sight of the Gaṅgā
is more pleasing than that of the desired
objects or sons 13. 27. 74-76; (x) Gaṅgā
offers sustenance to those who depend on her
13. 27. 51-52; (11) Relationship with other
rivers: (i) Tripathagā Gaṅgā looked upon as
the first to be created among the rivers ({%tathā%}
{%tripathagā gaṅgā nadīnām agrajā smṛtā%})

Bhagavān, Jāhnavī is said to be the best
among the rivers ({%srotasām asmi jāhnavī%})
6. 32. 31; also cf. 13. 27. 50; (iii) the Gaṅgā
has the same relationship to other rivers as
the sun has to other luminaries (?) in the sky,
the moon to the manes, and the king (?) to

of the rivers who wait upon Varuṇa in his
{%sabhā%} 2. 9. 17; (13) Limitation: Bhagī-
ratha told Brahmadeva that his stay even for
a hundred years on the bank of the Jāhnavī,
practising austerities and giving as gift a
thousand mules and a host of maidens ({%adāṃ%}
{%ca tatrāśvatarīsahasraṃ nārīpuram%}) was
not enough to take him to the Brahmaloka
which was beyond the world of the gods, the
cows and the sages 13. 106. 10, 5. {@E.@} Epic
events related to the Gaṅgā: (1) Marriage
with Saṃtanu and birth of Bhīṣma: King
Pratīpa once went to the bank of the Gaṅgā
({%gaṅgātīragataḥ%}) and sat down for many years
muttering prayers ({%japan%}) 1. 92. 1; Gaṅgā,
in the form of a beautiful woman, rose from
the waters and sat on the right thigh of king
Pratīpa 1. 92. 2-3; when asked by the king
what he might do to please her she requested
him to make love with her ({%tvām ahaṃ%}
{%kāmaye rājan kuruśreṣṭha bhajasva mām%})
1. 92. 4-5; but, at the king's suggestion,
she agreed to be his daughter-in-law and
disappeared 1. 92. 9-12, 15-16; she laid
down the condition that the king's son (her
future husband) should not know her identity
and should never question the propriety of her
actions ({%sa me nābhijanajñaḥ syād ācare-%}
{%yaṃ ca yad vibho / tat sarvam eva putras%}
{%te na mīmāṃseta karhicit%}) 1. 92. 13-14;
king Śāṃtanu, son of Pratīpa, once went for
hunting on the bank of the Gaṅgā; the river
appeared before him in the form of a beautiful
woman 1. 92. 25-26; when Śaṃtanu requested
her to be his wife she agreed on condition that
[Page329-a+ 40]
he did not prevent her from doing anything,
auspicious or otherwise ({%śubhaṃ vā yadi%}
{%vāśubham%}); should the king question her,
she would abandon him 1. 92. 31-35; when
the king consented, she, full of lustre, attended
on him as his wife 1. 92. 39-40; Gaṅgā, as
the wife of Śaṃtanu, gave birth to eight sons
seven of whom, as soon as they were born,
she threw away in the waters of the river
Gaṅgā; the king did not object to her on the
first seven occasions, but on the eighth occa-
sion he asked her to spare him a son; he
also wanted to know who she really was
1. 92. 44-47; when thus questioned, she told
Śaṃtanu that she was the river Gaṅgā, the
daughter of Jahnu, and that she lived with
him to achieve some purpose of the gods
({%devakāryārthasiddhyartham%} 1. 92. 49); the
eight sons she bore him were the eight Vasus
who were born as human beings due to the
curse of Vasiṣtha; she had promised the
Vasus that she would release them from their
human birth as soon as they were born
(cf. 1. 93. 40); she blessed the king before
her departure ({%svasti te 'stu gamiṣyāmi%}); she
told the king that she had lived with the Vasus
(while they were in her womb) in succession
({%eṣa paryāyavāso me vasūnāṃ saṃnidhau%}
{%kṛtaḥ%}) and that the eighth son who was to be
given to him later by her was the one born of
her (Gaṅgā) ({%matprasūtaṃ vijānīhi gaṅgā-%}
{%dattam imaṃ sutam%}) 1. 92. 48-55; Śaṃtanu
asked Jāhnavī who was Āpava (Vasiṣṭha)
and what fault the Vasus had committed to
invite the curse of Vasiṣṭha; he also asked
why the eighth son (Gaṅgādatta) was requir-
ed to live long among human beings 1. 9. 1-3;
Gaṅgā Jāhnavī then told the king the whole
story 1. 93. 5-42; Gaṅgā then disappeared
taking the last-born son with her 1. 93. 43;
[Page329-b+ 40]
many years later, King Śaṃtanu, while once
hunting along the river Gaṅgā Bhāgīrathī,
noticed that the river had little water ({%alpa-%}
{%jalām%} 1. 94. 21) and was not flowing as before
({%syandate kiṃ nv iyaṃ nādya%} 1. 94. 22);
trying to find out the cause of it the king
saw a young boy who had covered waters of
the entire Gaṅgā with his arrows 1. 94. 24-25;
Śaṃtanu suspected the boy to be his son and
hence asked Gaṅgā to show herself to him;
Gaṅgā appeared before the king holding the
boy in her right hand, but the king did not
immediately recognize her; Gaṅgā handed
over the son to the king 1. 94. 28-31, 36;
Śaṃtanu's marriage with Gaṅgā Bhāgīrathī
and the birth of Devavrata by her mentioned
in 1. 57. 76; 1. 90. 50; 5. 179. 5; 12. 38. 8;
12. 46. 15; the birth of the Vasus from Bhāgī-
rathī in the house of Śaṃtanu mentioned
in 1. 2. 78; 1. 61. 68; (2) Her role in
Bhīṣma's fight with Rāma Jāmadagnya:
When the fight between Bhīṣma and Rāma
Jāmadagnya was imminent, the latter threa-
tened to kill Bhīṣma so that Jāhnavī might
see him lying on the bed of arrows and the
daughter of Bhagīratha (Gaṅgā), who
gave birth to him, might weep seeing him
dead 5. 179. 3-5; when Bhīṣma was ready
to fight with Rāma, his mother appeared be-
fore him in her original form ({%svarūpiṇī%})
to try to dissuade Bhīṣma from the fight, and
expressed her readiness to go to Jāmadagnya
to beg him not to engage Bhīṣma, who was
his pupil, in fight; Bhīṣma then told her the
incidents which had led to the fight; then the
river (Gaṅgā) went to Rāma to dissuade
him; when told that it was Bhīṣma who was
to be dissuaded, Gaṅgā returned to Bhīṣma
and again pleaded with him; but Bhīṣma,
angered, did not agree to her request 5. 179.
[Page330-a+ 40]
22-30; Bhāgīrathī again appeared later in
this event when she joined the sages, Nārada
and others, who stood between Bhīṣma and
Rāma to stop them fighting with each other
5. 186. 27; (3) Her pleading with Ambā:
Gaṅgā, the mother of Bhīṣma, rose from the
waters and asked Ambā the purpose she
wanted to achieve by performing the auste-
rities; when told by Ambā that her effort was
aimed at the destruction of Bhīṣma, Gaṅgā
({%sāgaragā%}) told her that her purpose was
crooked ({%jihmaṃ carasi bhāmini%}); if she
persisted in observing her vows and if she
died during the observance of the vows she
would become a crooked river having water
only during the rainy season and not in the
remaining eight months ({%nadī bhaviṣyasi%}
{%śubhe kuṭilā vārṣikodakā / … vārṣikī nāṣṭa-%}
{%māsikī%}); Bhīsma's mother then returned from
the place where Ambā practised austerities
6. 187. 29-36; (4) Death of Bhīṣma: When
Bhīṣma, after his fall on the battle-field,
resolved to hold his life till the start of the
Uttarāyaṇa, Gaṅgā, knowing his resolve,
sent to him the great sages in the form of
swans 6. 114. 90; much later, after the
cremation of Bhīṣma, Dhṛtarāṣṭra and the
rest, including Vyāsa, Nārada, Asita and
Kṛṣṇa, went to the bank of the Bhāgīrathī
and all the Kṣatriya warriors and citizens
offered water offerings to him; then Bhāgīrathī
arose from water and, crying, lamented the
death of her son; she addressed her words to
the Kauravas praising and recounting the good
qualities of Bhīṣma 13. 154. 17-26; the
grieved Bhāgīrathī was consoled by Dāmo-
dara (Kṛṣṇa) assuring her that her son was
brought down from the chariot by Arjuna
and not by Śikhaṇḍin and that he had return-
ed to the Vasus in heaven 13. 154. 27-32;
[Page330-b+ 40]
Bhāgīrathī then gave up grief and entered
her own waters; Kṛṣṇa and others, after
honouring the river ({%satkṛtya te tāṃ saritam%})
returned from that place (to Hāstinapura)
when permitted by her to do so ({%anujñātās%}
{%tayā%}) 13. 154. 33-34; when Dhṛtarāṣṭra had
offered water offerings to Bhīṣma, Yudhiṣṭhira
came out of water with Dhṛtarāṣṭra and,
grief-stricken, fell on the bank of the Gaṅgā
14. 1. 1-2; (5) Arjuna punished for his role
in the fall of Bhīṣma: Ulūpī told Arjuna
that his defeat at the hands of his son Babhru-
vāhana was an expiation ({%niṣkṛtiḥ%}) he had
to undergo for the {%adharma%} committed by him
in bringing about the fall of Bhīṣma 14. 82. 8;
this expiation was prescribed by the Vasus
and the Gaṅgā ({%eṣā tu vihitā śāntiḥ putrād%}
{%yāṃ prāptavān asi /vasubhir vasudhāpāla%}
{%gaṅgayā ca mahāmate%}) 14. 82. 11; when
Bhīṣma died ({%hate śāntanave nṛpe%}) the
Vasus emerged from waters and meeting the
great river, told her that they wanted to
curse Arjuna for his misdeed in the war, to
which Bhāgīrathī agreed ({%idam ūcur vaco%}
{%ghoraṃ bhāgīrathyā mate tadā // … vayam%}
{%apy arjunaṃ … śāpena yojayāmeti tathāstv%}
{%iti cābravīt //%}) 14. 82. 12-15; (6) The
Pāṇḍavas came across the Gaṅgā at various
places: (i) When Yudhiṣṭhira and his bro-
thers decided to go on a pilgrimage, the
Brāhmaṇas expressed their wish to visit with
them the Gaṅgā and other rivers 3. 91. 10;
when they arrived at Prayāga at the con-
fluence of the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā the
Pāṇḍavas bathed in their waters ({%āplutya%}
{%gātrāṇi%}), practised the severest austerities
and gave gifts to the Brāhmaṇas 3. 93. 5-6;
(ii) They again arrived at the Bhāgīrathī
flowing by the side of the Agastyāśrama
where Lomaśa advised them to bathe at
[Page331-a+ 40]
will ({%yatheṣṭam avagāhyatām%}) 3. 97. 27;
(iii) Going further from the river Kauśikī,
they arrived at the place where the Gaṅgā
met the ocean and bathed there in waters
of five hundred rivers ({%nadīśatānāṃ pañcā-%}
{%nāṃ madhye cakre samāplavam%}) 3. 114. 2;
(iv) On reaching the vicinity of the Maināka
mountain, Lomaśa showed the river Gaṅgā
to Yudhiṣṭhira; he advised Yudhiṣṭhira to
bathe in the Gaṅgā to be freed of all sins;
he also advised him to bathe silently ({%tūṣṇīṃ%}
{%gaṅgām … samupaspṛśa%}) 3. 135. 5-7; (v)
When the Pāṇḍavas had crossed the Uśīra-
bīja, the Maināka, the Śvetagiri and the
Kālaśaila mountains, Lomaśa showed them
the Gaṅgā flowing in seven currents ({%eṣā%}
{%gaṅgā saptavidhā%}) 3. 140. 1-2; Lomaśa
could hear the sound of the Gaṅgā on the
top on the mountain Jāmbūnada 3. 140. 14;
(vi) The Pāṇḍavas saw the Bhāgīrathī on
the Kailāsa mountain; they lived there giving
offerings to gods and manes again and again
3. 145. 37, 40, 42; (7) Some events after
the war and the funeral rites offered to the
dead: (i) When Yudhiṣṭhira went to meet
Dhṛtarāṣṭra who had left Hāstinapura, he
saw the Kaurava women lamenting on the
bank of the Gaṅgā 11. 11. 5; (ii) Vyāsa,
who knew that Gāndhārī would curse the
Pāṇḍavas in their first meeting with her after
the war, hastened to them after bathing ({%upa-%}
{%spṛśya%}) in the Gaṅgā 11. 13. 4; (iii) After
lifting the funeral pyre of Droṇa, his pupils,
keeping Kṛpī in the front, proceeded to the
Gaṅgā 11. 23. 42; (iv) After arranging
for the cremation of all the heroes who fell
in the war, Yudhiṣṭhira, accompanied by
Dhṛtarāṣṭra, went towards the Gaṅgā 11.
26. 44; on reaching the Gaṅgā, Yudhiṣṭhira
and the Kaurava women offered water offerings
[Page331-b+ 40]
to the departed ({%pracakruḥ salilakriyāḥ%});
at that moment the Gaṅgā became easily
fordable spreading herself out widely ({%sūpa-%}
{%tīrthābhavad gaṅgā bhūyo viprasasāra ca%});
the bank of the Gaṅgā then was without
joy and merriment ({%nirānandam anutsavam%}
{% … gaṅgātīram aśobhata%}) 11. 27. 1-5; (v)
Yudhisṭhira, after giving water offerings to
Karṇa ({%cakārāsyodakaṃ prabhuḥ%} 11. 27.
21) and after performing the funeral rites for
him with the wives of Karṇa, came out of
the river Gaṅgā ({%sa tābhiḥ saha dharmātmā%}
{%pretakṛtyam anantaram kṛtvōttatāra gaṅgā-%}
{%yāḥ%}) 11. 27. 24; (vi) When the Pāṇḍavas,
who had given water offerings, were still
on the Bhāgīrathī, Dvaipāyana, Narada
and others and their pupils and hundreds
of thousands of other Brāhmaṇas gathered
there to console Yudhiṣṭhira 12. 1. 1-2,
4-5, 8; (8) Cremation of Pāṇḍu and
Mādrī: The cremation was performed on
an auspicious and even spot in the forest on
the river Gaṅgā ({%ramaṇīye vanoddeśe%}
{%gaṅgātīre same śubhe%}); the bier ({%śibikā%})
in which their dead bodies were brought from
Hāstinapura were placed on this spot 1. 118.
16-17; (9) Certain other epic events in
which the Gaṅgā is referred to: (i) At
Pramāṇakoṭi, Duryodhana tied up Bhīma,
while he was asleep, and threw him in the
waters of the Gaṅgā 1. 55. 10; 3. 13. 74;
(ii) Droṇa with his pupils once went to the
Gaṅgā for bathing when a crocodile caught
him by his ankle ({%jaṅghānte%}) 1. 123. 69;
(iii) When Drupada was brought captive by
his pupils to Droṇa, the latter told Drupada
that in future he (Drupada) would rule over
the Pañcāla country which lay to the south
of the Bhāgīrathī while he (Droṇa) himself
would rule over the part of the country which
[Page332-a+ 40]
lay to its north; Drupada then established
himself in the capital city of Kampilya in the
countryside of Mākandī on the river Gaṅgā
ruling the southern Pāñcālas as far as the
river Carmaṇvatī 1. 128. 12, 15; 1. 154. 24;
(iv) Drupada while reaming along the bank
of the Gāṅgā, came across a settlement of the
Brāhmaṇas ({%brāhmaṇāvasatha%}) 1. 155. 5;
(v) The Aṅgāraparṇa episode: The Pāṇḍa-
vas on their way to the Pañcālas reached the
Somaśravāyaṇa {%tīrtha%} on the river Gaṅgā;
Aṅgāraparṇa, king of the Gandharvas, had
already arrived there to sport with his wives
in the waters of the river Gaṅgā Bhāgīrathī;
he was angered when he heard the voice of
the Pāṇḍavas approaching the river; he told
the Pāṇḍavas to leave the place as the forest
along the rivers Gaṅgā and Vākā belonged
to him; Arjuna questioned the sole right of
the Gandharva over the river either at night,
or by day, or in twilight ({%nadyām asyām%}
{% … kasya kḷptaḥ parigrahaḥ%} 1. 158. 15);
it was therefore not proper for the Gan-
dharva to withhold the river from others
since that was against the age old custom
({%katham icchasi tāṃ roddhuṃ naiṣa dhar-%}
{%maḥ sanātanaḥ%} 1. 158. 20); why should the
Pāṇḍavas be restrained from touching the
waters of the Bhāgīrathī 1. 158. 2, 4, 5, 11,
13, 15, 20, 21; defeat of Aṅgāraparṇa in
this episode alluded to in 1. 2. 86; later the
Gandharva and the Pāṇḍavas took leave of
each other on the bank of the Bhāgīrathī
1. 174. 5; (vi) Arjuna, during the period
of his exile, entered the river Gaṅgā for
bathing; as he wanted to come out of the
water he was dragged by Ulūpī in the water
of that river 1. 206. 11-13; (vii) Arjuna,
during his exile, while going to the east,
crossed many rivers one of them being the
[Page332-b+ 40]
Gaṅgā 1. 207. 5-6; (viii) Kṛṣṇa, Bhīma
and Arjuna crossed the rivers Mālā, Carmaṇ-
vatī and Gaṅgā on their way to the Magadha
2. 18. 21; (ix) On account of the cries of
thousands of animals that were burnt at the
Khāṇḍava forest the fish in the waters (?)
of the Gaṅgā were terrified 1. 219. 28
({%tena śabdena vitresur gaṅgodadhicarā%}
{%jhaṣāḥ;%} Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 228. 32: {%gaṅgo-%}
{%dodhicarā iti atidūrasthopalakṣaṇam%}); (x)
The Pāṇḍavas spent their first night of forest
life under a banyan tree called Pramāṇa on
the river Jāhnavī; they bathed in it and had
only the water of the Jāhnavī to drink for
the night 3. 1. 39-40; from the bank of the
river Jāhnavī they started towards the Kuru-
kṣetra 3. 6. 1; (xi) On the mountain
Himavant Arjuna took bath in the Gaṅgā
before ascending Indra's chariot to go to the
Indraloka 3. 43. 20; (xii) Bhīṣma once
lived as a {%muni%} on the bank of the river
Bhāgīrathī practising the vow taken by his
father ({%pitryaṃ vratam%}); there he heard
from Pulastya the fruit obtained by visiting
the {%tīrthas%} 3. 80. 11-12; there, on the bank
of the Gaṅgā, he also heard the narrative of
Vipula from Mārkaṇḍeya 13. 43. 17; (xiii)
When the Pāṇḍavas were near the Gandha-
mādana mountain (3. 155. 34) Yudhiṣṭhira
showed to Bhīma the river Mahāgaṅgā 3.
155. 69, 85; (xiv) The basket ({%mañjūṣā%})
containing the newly born Karṇa went down
from the river Aśvanadī to the Gaṅgā (via
the Carmaṇvatī and the Yamunā) and then
to the city of Campā 3. 292. 25-26; when
the Sūta Adhiratha went with his wife to the
Jāhnavī, she saw there by chance the floating
basket brought to the bank by the waves of
the Jāhnavī 3. 293. 1, 3; (xv) The army of
the Kauravas, collected for the war, spread
[Page333-a+ 40]
along the bank of the Gaṅgā 5. 19. 30;
(xvi) Kuntī, who wished to approach Karṇa
to tell him the truth about his birth, went
to the Bhāgīrathī to meet him; there on the
bank of the Gaṅgā she heard the sound of
the prayers recited by Karṇa 5. 142. 26-27;
(xvii) Arjuna wishing to propitiate Śiva
to seek his help in fulfilling the vow to kill
Jayadratha saw the Gaṅgā on his way 7. 57.
24; (xviii) Bhīma, in search of Aśva-
tthāman, reached the bank of the Bhāgīrathī
where he saw Vyāsa and the other sages seated
on the bank ({%udakānte%}) 10. 13. 12-13;
(xix) After the great war, Kṛpa, Aśvatthā-
man and Kṛtavarman, after their meeting
with Dhṛtarāṣṭra, rode fast on horse-back to-
wards the Gaṅgā 11. 10. 19; (xx) Bhīṣma,
having narrated to Yudhiṣṭhira the Itihāsa
connected with the praise of the Gaṅgā
({%itihāsaṃ … gaṅgāyāḥ stavasaṃyutam%}), ad-
vised him to approach the Gaṅgā with great
devotion in order to obtain the highest per-
fection ({%siddhim uttamām%}); he and his
brothers were delighted to hear this Itihāsa
of the Gaṅgā from Bhīṣma 13. 27. 103-104;
(xxi) When Dhṛtarāṣṭra decided to retire to
the forest he, along with Gāndhārī, Kuntī,
Vidura and Saṃjaya, went in a day a long
distance from Hastinapura and camped on
the bank of the Bhāgīrathī; next morning
they started from there towards the north
15. 24. 16, 23; after going some distance they
again camped on the bank of the Bhāgīrathī;
in the evening he and Gāndhārī went to the
Gaṅgā and performed the prescribed puri-
ficatory rites ({%cakāra vidhivac chaucam%});
Vidura and other men performed individually
all the necessary rites ({%cakruḥ sarvāḥ kriyās%}
{%tatra puruṣā vidurādayaḥ%}) after bathing in
the various {%tīrthas (tīrtheṣv āplutya);%} when
[Page333-b+ 40]
the purificatory rites were over Kuntī led
Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Gāndhārī to the bank of the
Gaṅgā; there the priests of the king laid a
Vedī ({%kṛto vedīparistaraḥ%}) on which Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra gave offerings in the fire; from the
bank of the Bhāgīrathī they all proceeded to
the Kurukṣetra 15. 25. 1, 4-8; (10) Meet-
ing with the dead: Vyāsa asked Dhṛtarāṣṭra
and all those staying with him to go to the
bank of the Bhāgīrathī to meet all those
who fell in the war; accordingly all of them
went to the Gaṅgā and resided there 15. 39.
18-22; then in the evening Vyāsa bathed in
the Bhāgīrathī and invoked all those who
fought on the side of the Pāṇḍavas and the
Kauravas; at his call, all the kings, Bhīṣma,
Droṇa, and the rest, together with their armies,
rose in thousands from the water (of the
Bhāgīrathī) 15. 40. 4, 7, 13; after some time,
at the instance of Vyāsa, they again dis-
appeared plunging into the river Tripathagā
(Gaṅgā) and repaired to their respective
places; then Vyāsa, standing in the water
(of the Tripathagā), told the Kaurava women
that those who wished to obtain the worlds
of their respective deceased husbands should
quickly enter the water of the Jāhnavī; the
women, fully believing the words of Vyāsa,
took permission of Dhṛtarāṣṭra and entered
the water of the Jāhnavī; freed of their bodies
they were united with their husbands and
acquired the worlds of their husbands 15.
41. 13, 17-21; (11) End of Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
Gāndhārī and Kuntī: When Nārada arrived
at Hāstinapura to meet Yudhiṣṭhira he paid
a visit to the Gaṅgā on his way; people
residing near the Gaṅgā had told Yudhi-
ṣṭhira that Dhṛtarāṣṭra was engaged in
severe austerities; Yudhiṣṭhira therefore
asked Nārada if he had met Dhṛtarāṣṭra
[Page334-a+ 40]
and the rest during his visit to the Gaṅgā
and how they fared; Nārada told him that
after their last meeting with Dhṛtarāṣṭra the
latter had repaired to the Gaṅgādvāra; once,
after his bath in the Gaṅgā, when Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra had started for his hermitage, wind
arose, fire engulfed the forest, and burnt it
({%gaṅgāyām āpluto dhīmān āśṛamābhimukho%}
{%'bhavat%} 15. 45. 18); Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Gāndhārī
and Kuntī were burnt in the fire; only Saṃ-
jaya escaped from the forest fire and was
seen, surrounded by ascetics, by Nārada
on the bank of the Gaṅgā 15. 45. 5-6, 10,
29-32; Nārada further informed Yudhiṣṭhira
that Dhṛtarāṣṭra was burnt on the bank of
the Jāhnavī not by the ordinary fire but by
the sacred fire which Dhṛtarāṣṭra himself
and his priests had left after performing the
rites (i. e. the forest fire was caused by the
sacred fire left by Dhṛtarāṣṭra) ({%nāsau vṛthā-%}
{%gninā dagdho yathā tatra śrutaṃ mayā%});
this was reported to Nārada by the sages
whom he met on the bank of the Bhāgīrathī
15. 47. 1-6; when asked by Nārada to give
the water offerings to Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Gāndhārī
and Kuntī ({%kartum arhasi kaunteya teṣāṃ%}
{%tvam udakakriyām%}), Yudhiṣṭhira went to the
Gaṅgā with his brothers and wife; there,
going into the water, they all offered water
({%dadus toyam%}) and stayed outside the city
to undergo purification ({%śaucaṃ nivartaya-%}
{%ntaḥ%}) 15. 47. 9-13; (12) Ulūpī entered the
Gaṅgā when, at the end, the Pāṇḍavas and
Draupadī started for the forest 17. 1. 25;
{@F.@} Past and mythological events in which
the river Gaṅgā figures: (1) Past events:
(i) Bhagīratha brought her down from the
heaven: The sage Kapila had told Aṃśu-
mant, the grandson of Sagara, that his
grandson will bring down the Tripathagā
[Page334-b+ 40]
from the heaven by propitiating Maheśvara
for the purification of the burnt sons of
Sagara 3. 107. 27; however, the descent of
the Gaṅgā from the heaven was first attem-
pted by Dilīpa, father of Bhagīratha, with-
out success 3. 106. 38; Bhagīratha, desirous
of seeking the favour of the Gaṅgā, went
to the Himavant to practise austerities 3.
107. 4; after one thousand years the Gaṅgā
appeared before Bhagīratha in a bodily form
3. 107. 14; when requested by Bhagīratha to
wash the bones ({%śarīrāṇi%}) of the sons of
Sagara so that they might go to heaven,
she agreed, but first asked Bhagīratha to
propitiate Śiva by {%tapas%} so that he might
agree to hold her on his head; no one else
could check her speed when she descended from
heaven; Bhagīratha succeeded in securing a
boon from Śaṅkara to hold the Gaṅgā 3.
107. 18-25; Śiva assured Bhagīratha to
hold the Devanadī (Gaṅgā) when she came
down from heaven; Śiva then went to the
Himavant and asked Bhagīratha to request
the daughter of the king of the mountains
(Gaṅgā not directly named) to come down
from the heaven; when Bhagīratha thought
of the Gaṅgā ({%gaṅgāṃ samanucintayat%}
3. 108. 5), the river descended from heaven
on Śiva's forehead; the river became triple
while flowing thence to the ocean ({%sā ba-%}
{%bhūva visarpantī tridhā rājan samudragā%}
3. 108. 10); the river asked Bhagīratha to
show her the way; Bhagīratha led her to the
place where lay the bones ({%śarīṛāṇi%}) of the
sons of Sagara; after holding the Gaṅgā on
his head Hara went to the Kailāsa; Bhagī-
ratha having reached the ocean with the
Gaṅgā filled it with the water of the river;
Bhagīratha made Gaṅgā his daughter ({%duhi-%}
{%tṛtve ca nṛpatir gaṅgāṃ samanukalpayat%});
[Page335-a+ 40]
he offered water of the Gaṅgā to the manes
3. 108. 17; 12. 29. 62; Lomaśa thus told
Yudhiṣṭhira how the Gaṅgā came to be Tri-
pathagā (flowing in three regions-heaven,
mid-region, and the earth) and how she was
made to descend also to fill the ocean with
water ({%pūraṇārthaṃ samudrasya pṛthivīm%}
{%avatāritā%}) 3. 108. 2-18; the incident of the
descent of the Gaṅgā on the head of Śiva also
alluded to in 5. 109. 6; 6. 7. 28; 13. 27. 71, 87,
89, 95; 13. 106. 26; 13. 134. 17; (ii) Other
events related to Bhagīratha and the Gaṅgā:
(a) Gaṅgā Bhāgīrathī formerly sat on the
lap of Bhagīratha while he was seated on the
slope (near the river), hence she came to
be known as Urvaśī ({%upahvare nivasato%}
{%yasyāṅke niṣasāda ha / gaṅgā bhāgīṛathī%}
{%tasmād urvaśī hy abhavat purā%} 12. 29. 61

saras Bhagīratha watched Bhāgīrathī Gaṅgā
and lived there for many years 2. 3. 9; 6.
7. 41; (c) Bhagīratha gave on the Gaṅgā
a myriad of hundreds of cows ({%gavāṃ%}
{%śatānām ayutam%}) 13. 106. 37; he gave
gifts (of cows ?) which would cover the
entire current of the Gaṅgā ({%srotaś ca%}
{%yāvad gaṅgāyāś channam āsīj jagatpate /%}
{%dakṣiṇābhiḥ pravṛttābhiḥ%}) 13. 106. 24;
(iii) Jahnu and the Gaṅgā: The Gaṅgā
became the daughter of Jahnu ({%duhitṛtvam%}
{%anuprāptā gaṅgā yasya%} (i. e. {%jahnoḥ%}))
13. 4. 3; Jahnu waited on her ({%jahnur%}
{%jāhnavisevitā%}) 13. 151. 44; (iv) King
Yayāti, desirous of arranging a Svayaṃvara
for his daughter Mādhavī, went to a hermitage
situated on the confluence of the Gaṅgā and
the Yamunā; his sons Pūru and Yadu put
[Page335-b+ 40]
their sister on a chariot and rushed to the
same hermitage 5. 118. 1-2; the entire region
between the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā in the
middle of the earth was given by Yayāti to
his son Pūru as his kingdom ({%gaṅgāyamu-%}
{%nayor madhye kṛtsno 'yaṃ viṣiyas tava /%}
{%madhye pṛthivyās tvaṃ rājā%}) 1. 82. 5;
(v) A battle was fought between Haryaśva
and the Haihayas, the kinsmen of Vītahavya,
in the region lying between the Gaṅgā and
the Yamunā; in this battle Haryaśva was
killed 13. 31. 11; Divodāsa, son of Sudeva,
established Vārāṇasī on the north bank of the
Gaṅgā and to the south of Gomatī (to avoid
the attack by the Haihayas) 13. 31. 18, 16;
when, later, Pratardana, the son of Divodāsa,
wanted to attack the Vaitahavyas (= Hai-
hayas) he crossed the river Gaṅgā 13. 31. 35;
(vi) On the river Gaṅgā, near Kanyakubja,
king Gādhi married his daughter Satyavatī to
Ṛcīka Bhārgava 3. 115. 17; (vii) The sage
Cyavana Bhārgava once took the vow of
staying in water for twelve years ({%udavāsa-%}
{%kṛtārambho babhūva sumahāvrataḥ … var-%}
{%ṣāṇi dvādaśa munir jalavāse dhṛtavrataḥ%})
13. 50. 3-4; he became stiff like a post
({%sthāṇubhūtaḥ%}) and after worshipping the
deities entered the waters of the Gaṅgā and
the Yamunā; he withstood with his head the
terrific current of the two rivers; the two
rivers, and those which followed them, made
a {%pradakṣiṇā%} of the sage and did not cause
harm to him; the sage slept in the waters like
a log of wood and then stood erect ({%antar%}
{%jale sa suṣvāpa kāṣṭhabhūto mahāmuniḥ /%}
{%tataś cordhvasthito dhīmān abhavad bhara-%}
{%tarṣabha%}) 13. 50. 6-9; (viii) Sage Cyavana
took his residence for some time on the bank of
the river Gaṅgā to observe a {%vrata%} 13. 53. 55;
(ix) At a place not far from Kanyakubja
[Page336-a+ 40]
on the bank of the Gaṅgā is the Aśvatīrtha
where from the waters of the Gaṅgā arose
a thousand horses having one black ear;
Ṛcīka, the son of Cyavana, got them by
the favour of Varuṇa 13. 4. 16-17; (x)
A certain Brāhmaṇa once lived in the city
Mahāpadma on the southern bank of the
Gaṅgā 12. 341. 1; (xi) When Śuka was
born on the mountain Meru ({%merupṛṣṭhe%}),
Gaṅgā in her original form ({%svarūpiṇī%})
arrived there to bathe him 12. 311. 12;
(xii) Once, Suvarṇaṣṭhīvin, the young son
of Sṛñjaya, accompanied by his nurse, ran
while playing on the bank of the Bhāgīrathī;
he was then attacked by Indra's {%vajra%} in
the form of a tiger 12. 31. 31; (xiii) Gau-
tama and his brothers put their eldest brother
Dīrghatamas in a wooden box and put it on
the Gaṅgā; king Bali, who had gone to bathe
in the river Gaṅgā (not named), saw the box
brought to him by the current of the water
1. 98. 18, 21; (xiv) When the Kṣatriyas
were destroyed by Rāma Jāmadagnya, Aṅga,
the son of Diviratha, was protected by Gau-
tama on the bank of the Gaṅgā 12. 49. 72;
(xv) Bharata, the son of Duḥṣanta, offered
on different rivers a thousand horse-sacrifices
of which he bound fourteen horses on the river
Gaṅgā ({%yo baddhvā … aśvān devebhyo … %}
{%gaṅgām anu caturdaśa // aśvamedhasaha-%}
{%sreṇa … iṣṭavān sa mahātejā dauḥṣantir%}
{%bharataḥ purā //%}) 12. 29. 41-42; (xvi)
Bharadvāja, when he went to the Gaṅgā for
bath, saw there the Apsaras Ghṛtācī who
had also come there to bathe 1. 154. 2;
(xvii) Vasiṣṭha turned the Gaṅgā, proceed-
ing towards the Kailāsa, to the Mānasa lake;
when that lake got mixed with the river,
the Gaṅgā became the Sarayū 13. 140. 23-24;
(xviii) Rājadharman, the son of Kaśyapa
[Page336-b+ 40]
and Dākṣāyaṇī, offered to Gautama, his guest,
large fishes ({%mahāmīnāḥ%}) obtained from the
regions through which the river Gaṅgā flew
12. 164. 4; (xix) A certain Brāhmaṇa,
Kauśika by name, told the truth to the robbers
about the whereabouts of the people who
were afraid of them; by this act he incurred
sin on the river Gaṅgā 12. 110. 8 (reference
to 8. 49. 41-46 where in st. 32 Gaṅgā is
not named); (xx) The following persons
attained perfection ({%siddhi%}) on the Gaṅgā:
(1) Śilavṛtti, when instructed by Siddha on
the virtues of the Tripathā, worshipped the
Gaṅgā according to the rites and attained
perfection which was very difficult to attain;
Siddha himself, after instructing Śilarati,
entered the sky 13. 27. 101-102; (2) Sage
Sanatkumāra attained great perfection on the
Gaṅgā 3. 135. 6; (xxi) Indra, in the form
of a very weak Brāhmaṇa, appeared before
Yavakrī and started doing an impossible
deed viz. constructing a dam in the Bhāgī-
rathī by filling the Gaṅgā with sand; he
poured constantly handfuls of sand in the
Bhāgīrathī; when asked by Yavakrī smilingly
why he was busy with this fruitless effort
Indra told him that he wanted to construct
a dam in the Gaṅgā so that the river can be
crossed easily 3. 135. 30-36; (2) Mytho-
logical: (i) Gaṅgā once went to pay a
visit to Pitāmaha (Brahmadeva) in his as-
sembly; there her garment was displaced by
the wind; King Mahābhiṣa, who happened to
be there, constantly looked at her in that
condition; he was therefore cursed to be born
again as a human being; Gaṅgā returned
from the assembly continuing to think about
Mahābhīṣa; she saw the Vasus, dejected,
going along the way; she asked them the
cause of their dejection; the Vasus told her
[Page337-a+ 40]
that they were cursed by Vasiṣṭha to be born
as humans; they requested Gaṅgā to assume
a human form so that she could give birth
to them as humans; Gaṅgā agreed and asked
them whom would they like to be their father;
they chose Śaṃtanu, the son of Pratīpa;
Gaṅgā also had thought of the same person,
hence she would do what was dear to the king
and to the Vasus; Vasus requested Gaṅgā to
throw them into water no sooner they were
born; Gaṅgā agreed to even that request,
but asked them to spare one of them so that
Śaṃtanu's union with her would not be totally
fruitless; Vasus consented to do that, each
one of them contributing one-eighth share for
Gaṅgā's son; and they also told her that the
son of the Gaṅgā would beget no son; having
come to this agreement with the Gaṅgā
the Vasus, delighted, went their way 1. 91.
4-22; (ii) The lustre ({%tejaḥ%} 13. 84. 11)
of Rudra fell in Agni; Agni was to beget
through that lustre a son on the Gaṅgā for
killing the enemy of the gods; Agni went
to the Gaṅgā Bhāgīrathī and became mixed
with her; as a result, Gaṅgā became pregnant;
Gaṅgā could not bear the embryo, was men-
tally distressed, and was in great agony;
when Agni laid the lustrous embryo in the
Gaṅgā, an Asura (not named) roared fiercely;
terrified, the Gaṅgā was unable to bear the
embryo; Jāhnavī, with her body covered with
lustre and trembling, told Agni that she could
not contain his lustre within her; she was
very much uneasy and was agitated; she
would like to cast away the embryo, as she
could hold it no longer, and not because of
her sweet will; she was no longer her usual
self; Agni, however, asked her to contain the
embryo within her: as she was capable of
bearing and containing the whole earth there
[Page337-b+ 40]
was nothing which Gaṅgā could not achieve
except (perhaps) containing the seed of Agni;
in spite of the entreaties of Vahni and the
other gods the Gaṅgā cast off the embryo on
mount Meru; Gaṅgā was capable of holding
an embryo, but she could not do it on this
occasion as she was overcome by the lustre
of Rudra; when she cast it off, she appeared
before Agni who asked her if the delivery
was happy ({%kaccid garbhaḥ sukhodayaḥ%});
he asked her to describe to him the colour,
the form and the lustre of the child; having
described to Agni the form of his son the god-
dess ({%devī%}) Gaṅgā disappeared 13. 84. 8, 12,
52-72; 9. 43 8-9 (where the embryo is said
to have been cast off on the mountain Hima-
vant; when the embryo was cast off that part
of the mountain became of gold 9. 43. 14);
the son Kumāra was first Gāṅgeya (son of
Gaṅgā), then became Kārttikeya (the son of
the Kṛttikās); the Gaṅgā, the best among the
rivers, waited on him 9. 43. 20; when the
child approached Śiva, Pārvatī, Gaṅgā and
Pāvaka (Agni) each one of them wondered
whom he would show his honour by going to
him or her first ({%kiṃ nu pūrvam ayaṃ%}
{%bālo gauravād abhyupaiṣyati /api mām iti%}
{%sarveṣām teṣām āsīd manogatam%}) 9. 43.
34-35; knowing their mind the child assumed
four forms ({%tato 'bhavac caturmūrtiḥ%}), of
which the form Naigameṣa went to the Gaṅgā
9. 43. 37, 39; then all the four, Rudra, Devī,
Pāvaka and the Gaṅgā, bowed down to Pitā-
maha (Brahmadeva) and requested him to
grant Kumāra the overlordship of all beings
i. e. of the kings of all the classes of gods
({%ādhipatyam; senāpatyam dadau tasmai%}
{%sarvabhūteṣu bhārata / sarvadevanikāyānāṃ%}
{%ye rājānaḥ pariśrutāḥ / tān sarvān vyādi-%}
{%deśāsmai sarvabhūtapitāmahaḥ%}) 9. 43. 42,
[Page338-a+ 40]
44, 48, 49; when the gods gave different gifts
to Kumāra, Gaṅgā gave him a divine water
vessel which was the source of the nectar
({%kamaṇḍaluṃ divyam amṛtodbhavam utta-%}
{%mam%}) 9. 45. 45; people call Kumāra diffe-
rently the son of Pitamaha, or of Maheśvara,
or of Umā, or of the Kṛttikās, or of the
Gaṅgā 9. 45. 86; the incident is also allud-
ed to in 3. 207. 4; 13. 27. 87 ({%iyaṃ gāṅgā%}

performed a {%satra%} in the Naiṃiṣa forest (3.
189. 1), they saw a (golden) lotus coming
floating on the river Bhāgīrathī; to find out
its source, Indra went to the place of the
origin of the Gaṅgā ({%yatra gaṅgā satataṃ%}
{%saṃprasūtā%}); he saw there a woman weeping
while standing in the water of the river; the
tear which fell in the water became a golden
lotus 1. 189. 10-11; (iv) When, in former
times, Pitāmaha (Brahmadeva) once per-
formed a sacrifice on the Mahendra mountain,
Bhāgīrathī was present in the {%sadas (yatra%}
{%bhāgīrathī puṇyā sadasyāsīt)%} 3. 85. 17;
(v) When the fish, reared by Manu, outgrew
the size of the large {%vāpī,%} it requested Manu
to take it to the Gaṅgā, the chief wife of the
ocean ({%samudramahīṣīm … gaṅgām%}); as
requested, Manu took the fish to the Gaṅgā
and put it in its water; when the fish further
so grew in size that it could not move in the
Gaṅgā ({%gaṅgāyāṃ hi na śaknomi bṛhatvāc%}
{%deṣṭituṃ prabho%}), it requested Manu to take
it to the ocean; accordingly Manu pulled it
out of the Gaṅgā and took it to the ocean
3. 185. 18-19, 21-22; (vi) Nārada, once
early in the morning, descended into the water
of the Gaṅgā arising at the Dhruvadvāra to
take bath ({%pispṛkṣuḥ%}); Indra also happened
[Page338-b+ 40]
to go there; both of them bathed in its water
({%āplutya%}) and, with controlled mind, per-
formed {%japa;%} then they sat down on the bank,
covered with thin golden sand, to tell each
other stories told by gods and sages narrat-
ing holy deeds ({%puṇyakarmabhir ākhyātā%}
{%devarṣikathitāḥ kathāḥ%}) 12. 221. 6-9; (vii)
The two rivers, the Gaṅgā and the Sarasvatī,
became the eyebrows of Nārāyaṇa when he
assumed a different form by his mighty device
({%aiśvareṇa prayogeṇa dvitīyāṃ tanum āśrī-%}
{%taḥ%}) to get back the Vedas stolen by the two
Dānavas Madhu and Kaiṭabha 12. 335. 43,
46; (viii) Mṛtyu, conceived as a woman
(12. 249. 15-18), avoiding to kill men, went
to the river Gaṅgā on the mountain Meru
and stood there motionless like a piece of
wood 12. 250. 22; (ix) Mārkaṇḍeya saw the
Gaṅgā, among other rivers, in the belly of
the Bāla (3. 186. 83, i. e. Nārāyaṇa 3. 187.
3) 3. 186. 93; (x) When Śiva asked Umā
to instruct him in the duties of women ({%strī-%}
{%dharma%} 13. 134. 10), she first wanted to
consult the rivers, the Gaṅgā and others, who
were expert in that subject ({%strīdharma-%}
{%kuśalāḥ%}); when Umā approached the rivers
they appointed the Gaṅgā to address Umā
on their behalf; the river told Umā that they
felt blessed since Umā held them in high
esteem, but it was indeed Umā who was the
right person to instruct them in the {%strī-%}
{%dharma;%} when the goddess (Umā) was thus
honoured by the Gaṅgā she discoursed on the
{%strīdharmas%} to them 13. 134. 17-30; (xi)
Once, when the ocean asked the rivers why
they carried away large trees but not the
small and weak cane growing on their banks,
the Gaṅgā told him the reason convincingly
giving the grounds 12. 114. 3-7; (xii)
Rāma crossed (the Gaṅgā) at Śṛṅgaverapura
[Page339-a+ 40]
3. 83. 4; (xiii) Once, while Śiva was
seated on the peak of the mountain Meru
and was being attended upon by gods and
others, the Gaṅgā in bodily form ({%rūpiṇī%})
waited on him 12. 274. 16. {@G.@} Similes:

Pāṇḍavas proceeding to the battle-field looked
full and irresistible like the Gaṅgā ({%gaṅgeva%}
{%pūrṇā durdharṣā%}) 5. 149. 49; (iv) The
army, led by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, with its formid-
able archers looked full, tranquil and flowing
like the Gaṅgā ({%bhīmadhanvāyanī senā … %}

(v) Just as the sweet water of the Gaṅgā
becomes salty due to the property of the
ocean, similarly the valour of the heroes of
Duryodhana would be futile on meeting the
Pāṇḍavas 6. 79. 5-6; (vi) Duryodhana
desired to cross (the army of the Pāṇḍa-
vas) as one would want to cross in rainy
season the current of the Gaṅgā full of
sharks, alligators and crocodiles ({%sagrāhana-%}
{%kramakaraṃ gaṅgāvegam ivoṣṇage;%} Nī.

enter the army of the Kauravas as does the
current of the Gaṅgā the trees growing on
[Page339-b+ 40]
its banks 5. 50. 35; (viii) The Trigartas
(five brothers), in the war, would agitate
the army of the Pāṇḍavas as the crocodiles
agitate water of the Gaṅgā 5. 163. 10;
(ix) The army of the Kauravas, attacked
by Arjuna, was split into two (some going
to Droṇa, some to Duryodhana) as does the
Gaṅgā on meeting a mountain 7. 29. 29;
(x) The army of the Kauravas, at the sight
of Ghaṭotkaca, was struck with fear and was
agitated, as are the surging waves of the
Gaṅgā, whose eddies are agitated by wind
7. 131. 31; (xi) The Pāñcālas attacked the
army of Duryodhana on all sides as the
swans, returning from the Mānasa lake,
rush towards the Gaṅgā 8. 43. 64; (xii)
The army of the Pāṇḍavas was agitated by
the Madra warriors as is the Gaṅgā by the
hostile wind ({%purovātena gaṅgeva%}) 9. 17.
10; (xiii) When the Kaurava heroes (Droṇa
and others), who were ready (for attack)
at a distance of twenty steps attacked Abhi-
manyu, they appeared, for a while, like an
eddy of the Gaṅgā and the ocean (where the
former meets the latter) ({%te viṃśatipade%}

The armies of Duryodhana and Yudhiṣṭhira
clashed speedily with each other as do the
swollen waters of the Gaṅgā and the Sarayū
in the rainy season 7. 16. 49; (xv) The
two large armies led by Droṇa and Dhṛsṭa-
dyumna, having clashed with each other,
sped along as do the swollen waters of the
Jāhnavī and the Yamunā in the rainy
season 7. 70. 8; (xvi) The armies led by
[Page340-a+ 40]
Karṇa and Arjuna clashed fiercely as do the
Gaṅgā and the Yamunā 8. 31. 68; (2) In
other contexts: (i) The river of smoke
which connected the heaven and the earth
looked like the river Gaṅgā (coming down
from the heaven to the earth) ({%bhūmau%}

others) sat near the Sarasvatī adorning it as
do the gods the river Gaṅgā 9. 36. 47; (iii)
Duḥṣanta entered the forest on the river
Mālinī which was like the hermitage of Nara
and Nārāyaṇa on the river Gaṅgā 1. 64. 24;
(iv) King Bṛhadratha between his two wives
looked like the ocean in the bodily form
between the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā ({%gaṅgā-%}
{%yamunayor madhye mūrtimān iva sāgaraḥ%})
2. 16. 19; (v) King Divodāsa enjoyed
pleasures with Mādhavī as does the ocean
with the Jāhnavī 5. 115. 10; (vi) The eye-
brow with its three tips on the forehead of
the angered Bhīma looked like the Gaṅgā
flowing in three courses on the Trikūṭa ({%tri-%}

family which was (pure) like the water of
the Gaṅgā ({%gaṅgāhradāmbho 'bhijanopa-%}

does not have anything desirable never gets
anything that is splendid; he goes into noth-

28; (xi) Gaṅgā is comparable to the earth
in forbearance, protection and sustenance; to
the fire and the sun in brightness; and to
Guha in being always favourable to the
Brāhmaṇas ({%kṣāntyā mahyā gopane dhāraṇe%}

gave away in a horse sacrifice as many cows

in a sacrifice as {%dakṣiṇā%} as many cows as
would, while drinking (the water of the
Gaṅgā), drink up the current of the Gaṅgā
