{@A.@} Gift of Āditya to Yājñavalkya:
The sage Yājñavalkya told king Janaka that
while he was practising the prescribed rite,
(although) he was despised ({%? avamatena%}),
he propitiated the god Sun with severe
austerity; he then received from Āditya the
{%yajuses (yathārṣeṇeha vidhinā caratāvama-%}

him the {%yajuses%} which had not been used
before ({%? yajūṃṣi nopayuktāni kṣipram%}
{%icchāmi veditum%}) 12. 306. 4-5; the god
agreed to Yājñavalkya's request; Sarasvatī
then in the form of speech entered Yājña-
valkya's mouth 12. 306. 6-7; the God said
that as a result of that, the whole of Veda
(i. e. the Yajurveda) together with its latter
half and the {%khila%} would be established in
him (Yājñavalkya) ({%pratiṣṭhāsyati te vedaḥ%}
