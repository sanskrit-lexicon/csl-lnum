{@D.@} Epic events: (1) During his exile
Arjuna, after visiting the other {%tīrthas%} on the
west coast, went to Prabhāsa; Kṛṣṇa, hav-
ing come to know that Arjuna had arrived
at the Prabhāsadeśa, went there to meet him;
the two met at Prabhāsa; they sported there
according to their wishes and from there they
went to the Raivataka mountain 1. 210. 2-4,
8; (2) The Brāhmaṇas wished to visit the
Prabhāsa and the other {%tīrthas%} along with
Yudhiṣṭhira 3. 91. 10; (3) After visiting
Śūrpāraka, Yudhiṣṭhira went to Prabhāsa;
he bathed there and, with his brothers and
Kṛṣṇā, gave offerings to gods and manes;
the Brāhmaṇas and Lomaśa too offered there
to gods and manes; Yudhiṣṭhira practised
there severe austerities 3. 118. 15-17; (4)
Balarāma and Janārdana, along with the
Vṛṣṇi heroes, went to Prabhāsa to meet the
Pāṇḍavas; the Pāṇḍavas and the Vṛṣṇis held
consultations together at Prabhāsa 3. 118.
18; 3. 119. 1-3; (5) Arjuna, in his wander-
ings with the sacrificial horse, came to
Prabhāsa from Gokarṇa 14. 84. 12; (6)
[Page389-a+ 40]
Balarāma, in his {%tīrthayātrā,%} first went to
Prabhāsa 9. 34. 36; (7) The Yādavas,
desirous of visiting a {%tīrtha,%} went to
Prabhāsa and lived there; there they were
engaged in a drinking bout ({%prāvartata%}
{%mahāpānaṃ prabhāse%}); in the mutual kill-
ing that followed the Vṛṣṇi heroes, the Bhojas
and the Andhakas were all destroyed at
Prabhāsa 16. 9. 8-9. {@E.@} Past and my-
thological events: (1) At Prabhāsa Kṛṣṇa,
observing restraint ({%niyame sthitaḥ%}) stood
on one foot for a thousand divine years
({%divyaṃ varṣasahasrakam%}) to practise aus-
terities 3. 13. 14; (2) The sages Śukra,
Aṅgiras and others who came together at
Prabhāsa thought of going on a {%tīrthayātrā%}
from there; (3) Soma was cursed by
Dakṣa; as a result he was emaciated and could
not shine; Dakṣa Prajāpati advised him to
go to the {%tīrtha%} of Sarasvatī (i. e. Prabhāsa)
and emerge from there after taking a bath;
when Soma did this he could wax again; but
for one half of the month he would wane;
so Soma went to Prabhāsa and emerged
after bath on the new moon day; he could
illuminate the worlds; the gods then reached
Prabhāsa and, in the company of Soma,
met Dakṣa; this is why Prabhāsa became
the most excellent of all the {%tīrthas (pra-%}
{%bhāsaṃ ca yathā tīrthaṃ tīrthānāṃ pra-%}
{%varaṃ hy abhūt);%} on every new moon day
the moon bathes in Prabhāsa and waxes
again; that is why Prabhāsa is so called
9. 34. 67-77; 9. 34. 36-39; (the bath in
the Hiraṇyasaras {%tīrtha,%} which later became
known as Prabhāsa, was prescribed for Soma
by the sages 12. 329. 46). {@F.@} Holiness:
(1) If one who is pure and has a controll-
ed mind ({%śuciḥ prayatamānasaḥ%}) bathes at
Prabhāsa he secures for himself the fruit of
[Page389-b+ 40]
an Agniṣṭoma and an Atirātra sacrifice 3.
80. 78; (2) According to Aṅgiras one
who bathes in Prabhāsa is awakened in a
{%vimāna%} by the praises of Apsarases 13.
26. 9; (3) According to Aṅgiras, again,
one who with concentrated mind ({%samāhitaḥ%})
spends one night of the new moon day
({%amāvāsyām%}) at Prabhāsa has (as though)
a second birth as a Siddha ({%siddhyate 'tra%}
{%mahābāho yo naro jāyate punaḥ%}) 13. 26.
51; (4) According to a Gāthā sung by
Yayāti one who visits Prabhāsa lives long
again in this life ({%labdhāyur jīvite punaḥ%})
12. 148. 11; (5) If the high-souled persons,
observing vows, visit Prabhāsa they become
auspicious, obtain divine forms, wear divine
garlands, and full of divine fragrance they
reach the world of cows ({%? gavāṃ vimāne%})
13. 105. 45, 48 (for citation see {@Karatoyinī@}).
{@G.@} Importance: (1) God Agni himself is
always present there ({%yatra saṃnihito nityaṃ%}
{%svayam eva hutāśanaḥ%}) 3. 80. 77; (2) Men-
tioned in the Daivata-Ṛṣi-Vaṃśa 13. 151.
18, 2.
