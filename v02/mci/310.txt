{@Vinatā@}¦ f.: A mythical female being.
{@A.@} Family: One of the two daughters
of Prajāpati, sister of Kadrū (1. 19. 1),
both married to Kaśyapa 1. 14. 5-6; one
of the thirteen daughters of Dakṣa 1. 59.
12-13; hence called Dākṣāyaṇī 1. 27. 24.
{@B.@} Description: Divine ({%devī%}) 1. 14. 15;
beautiful, wonderful and faultless 1. 14. 5;
[Page057-a+ 40]
shining ({%śubhā,%} also 1. 14. 5), auspicious
({%kalyāṇī%}) and famous ({%yaśasvinī%}) 1. 27. 24.
{@C.@} Progeny: (1) Kaśyapa, her husband,
granted her a boon (also 1. 31. 2); she chose
to have two sons, stronger than the sons of
Kadrū; but the husband granted her one and a
half sons as desired ({%? adhyardhaṃ putram%}
{%īpsitam%} 1. 14. 9) [thus in view of the fact that
one of her two sons was not fully developed ?
1. 14. 16; 1. 27. 34]; when the husband said
“so be it”, Vinatā was delighted to know
that she will have two strong sons 1. 14. 6-
10; after a long time Vinatā laid two eggs
which were preserved for five hundred years
in warm pots by the female attendants
({%sopasvedeṣu bhāṇḍeṣu%} 1. 14. 13; Nī. {%sopas-%}
{%vedeṣu uṣmavatsu%} on 1. 16. 15 Bom. Ed.);
when after five hundred years Kadrū's sons
came out of the eggs but nothing came out of
the two eggs laid by Vinatā, she, ashamed and
desirous of quickly having a son, broke one
of the two eggs and saw her partly developed
son; angered, the son cursed his mother (also
1. 31. 1) for her impatience, to become the
slave ({%dāsī%} 1. 14. 17) of Kadrū with whom she
vied; he also told the mother that her second
son will free her from slavery if she did not
break the other egg prematurely and produce
a son deficient in limbs; the undeveloped son
became Aruṇa; her second son, Garuḍa, was
born at proper time; as soon as born he left
Vinatā and flew into the sky 1. 14. 12-22; 1.
26. 36; (2) Vinatā, desirous of having a son,
practised penance and observed vows; having
bathed and become pure she approached her
husband Kaśyapa for bringing forth a male
child; Kaśyapa told her that her effort would
succeed and that she would give birth to heroic
sons; he also told her to carefully bear the
{%garbha;%} Vinatā delighted when thus addressed
[Page057-b+ 40]
by her husband; she gave birth to Aruṇa and
Garuḍa 1. 27. 24-28; 33-34; hence Aruṇa
and Garuḍa called {%vainateyau%} ‘sons of
Vinatā’ 1. 31. 2 (See Garuḍa); (3) the two
sons born due to the penance of Vālakhilyas
and the conception of Kaśyapa ({%tapasā vāla-%}
{%khilyānāṃ mama saṃkalpajau tathā / bha-%}
{%viṣyato mahābhāgau putrau te lokapūjitau%})
1. 27. 27; 1. 27. 1-2; besides Aruṇa and
Garuḍa, Tārkṣya, Ariṣṭanemi, Āruṇi, Vāruṇi
also called {%vainateyāḥ%} 1. 59. 39; 1. 114. 62
(with slight difference, Asitadhvaja in place
of Vāruṇi); the line of Suparṇas descending
from her ({%vinatākula%}), of noble family,
propagated by Garuḍa through his six sons
5. 99. 1-4; [See Vainateya<sup>1</sup>]. {@D.@} Slave
of Kadrū: Once the two sisters Kadrū and
Vinatā happened to see the horse Uccaiḥ-
śravas from very near 1. 15. 1; Kadrū
later asked Vinatā the colour of the horse;
Vinatā declared it to be white and asked
Kadrū's opinion; Vinatā was ready to put a
wager on it; Kadrū declared that the horse
had dark hair on its tail; the two agreed to
lay a wager with slavery as stake; they then
went home agreeing to inspect the horse the
next day 1. 18. 2-5; next morning the two
sisters went to inspect Uccaiḥśravas from
near; they crossed the ocean on the way 1.
19. 1-3; when they found that there were
many black hair on the tail of Uccaiḥśravas,
Kadrū made Vinatā her slave; Vinatā who
lost the bet and was defeated was grieved
to be reduced to the condition of a slave 1.
20. 1-3; 1. 49. 6; once when Garuḍa visited
the slave Vinatā on the other shore of the
ocean, Kadrū asked Vinatā in the presence
of Garuḍa to take her to the beautiful
Rāmaṇīyaka, the abode of the {%nāgas%} in the
middle of the ocean; Vinatā did as command-
[Page058-a+ 40]
ed and Garuḍa, as directed by his mother,
carried the serpents 1. 21. 1-5; Garuḍa asked
Vinatā why he must act as told by the ser-
pents; Vinatā informed him that she having
lost the wager had become the slave of her
sister; the serpents, on being asked by Garuḍa
how he (and his mother) could be free from
slavery, told him to get {%amṛta%} for them
to win freedom from slavery 1. 23. 8-12;
Garuḍa got ready to fetch {%amṛta%} and
asked Vinatā what he might eat on way;
Vinatā asked him to eat the Niṣādas whose
abode lay far away in the middle of the ocean
({%samudrakukṣāv ekānte%} 1. 24. 2), and warned
him never to injure a Brāhmaṇa 1. 24. 1-3;
on being further asked by Garuḍa how he
could recognize a Brāhmaṇa, Vinatā told him:
“who, when swallowed, burns your throat like
a heated charcoal, know him to be a Brāh-
maṇa”; then Vinatā, although she knew the
incomparable prowess of her son, blessed him
as follows: “May Wind protect your wings,
Moon your back, Fire your head, and Sun
the whole of you; myself shall always endeav-
our for your comfort and well-being ({%śānti-%}
{%svastiparāyaṇā%} 1. 24. 9); may your path
be free from obstacles and may you succeed
in your task” 1. 24. 5-9; on way Garuḍa
met his father and told him that he was on his
way to fetch {%soma%} in order to free his mother
from slavery; he also told him that he was
asked by Vinatā to eat the Niṣādas but was
not satisfied even after eating thousands of
them; he asked Kaśyapa what else he might
eat 1. 25. 7-9; when Garuḍa succeeded in
getting {%soma (amṛta)%} he approached his
mother and told the serpents that since he
was leaving the {%amṛta%} for them on {%kuśa%} grass
his mother should be freed from slavery from
that day; the serpents said: “so be it”;
[Page058-b+ 38]
Garuḍa then roamed in the forest with his
mother Vinatā and gave delight to her 1. 30.
14-17, 21. {@E.@} Functions: Vinatā is one
of those (like Surasā, Surabhi and many
others) who wait upon Pitāmaha in his {%sabhā%}
2. 11. 29, 31. {@F.@} Svāhā identified with
Vinatā ?: Svāhā, the daughter of Dakṣa
(3. 213. 50) while getting away with the seed
of Agni assumed the form of a female Garuḍa
({%garuḍī%}), a female Suparṇa ({%suparṇī%}) to
escape identification 3. 214. 7-10); 3. 215. 3;
Svāhā as Vinatā (as Suparṇī 3. 215. 4) told
Skanda that he was her son qualified to give
her the {%śrāddha%} oblation ({%mama tvaṃ piṇḍa-%}
{%daḥ sutaḥ%}) 3. 219. 12; as one of the mothers
of Skanka, Vinatā, highly ferocious, assumes
the form of a {%śikunigraha%} (bird-affliction ?)
to torment young children until they are
sixteen years old 3. 219. 26, 22, 41.
