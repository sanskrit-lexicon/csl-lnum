Characteristics: (1) The trees in the Uttara
Kurus have sweet and juicy fruits and
fragrant flowers; they bear fruits and flowers
in all seasons; some trees give any kind of
fruit according to one's desire and others
always yield milk which has six flavours and
is like {%amṛta;%} they also produce garments
and ornaments from their fruits; jewelled
ground in the Uttara Kurus is spread over
with thin golden sand; it is everywhere
pleasant to touch and is free from mud; men
who fall down from the world of gods are
born there; both men and women there have
similar form and virtues; they are born in
pairs; the women are comparable with
{%apsaras;%} they drink milk, which is like
{%amṛta,%} of the milk-producing trees; since
they are born in pairs, they grow up to-
gether, are similar in form and virtues and
wear similar dress; they love each other
like the {%cakravāka%} birds; they are always
happy and live ten thousand and ten hundr-
ed years; free from disease, they are not
afflicted by sorrow; they never abandon each
other; when they die, very strong Bhāruṇḍa
birds, having sharp beaks, carry them away
and throw them in valleys; (this is a short
description of the Uttarakurus given by
Saṃjaya to Dhṛtarāṣṭra) ({%uttarā kuravo%}

The juicy fruits of the Jambū tree called
Sudarśana, falling on ground, give rise to
a river which, after encircling the Meru
mountain, flows to the Uttarakurus; the
men living in the Uttarakurus happily drink
that juice and hence oldage never over-
takes them ({%tasmin phalarase pīte na jarā%}
{%bādhate ca tān%}) 6. 8. 23-24; (3) At the
birth of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Pāṇḍu and Vidura, the
people of the Kuru country became so pros-
perous and happy that they are said to have
vied with the people of the Uttara Kurus

who are not born the natural way, i. e.
[Page637-a+ 40]
whose origin is in the fire or mountain, de-
light with gods ({%devaiḥ sārdhaṃ modamānā%}

seen the golden palace, looking like the
Gandharvanagara, and the wonderful
forest created by sage Cyavana wondered
whether he was bodily transferred to the
land of the Uttarakurus ({%aho saha śarīreṇa%}

13. 105. 25-26; (7) The gate-keepers of
Harivarṣa told Arjuna that those were the
lands of the Uttarakurus and he could not
conquer their town; one who entered it
did not remain a man: no wars were fought
on the lands of Uttarakurus; even if Arjuna
entered the land he would not be able to
see anything, since no one with a human
body could see anything there ({%tata enaṃ%}

(8) Formerly, women were not closet-
ed (in four walls), they moved as they
liked, and were independent; they united
with men other than their husbands since
their marriage as virgins, and in ancient
times that was not {%adharma,%} but {%dharma;%}
that ancient {%dharma,%} favourable to wo-
[Page637-b+ 40]
men, was still practised by people of the
Uttara Kurus ({%anāvṛtāḥ kila purā striya%}

26. {@E.@} Epic events: (1) Pāṇḍu told
Kuntī that the ancient {%dharma,%} applicable to
married women, was still followed among
the Uttarakurus 1. 113. 7 (see above {@D.@}
Characteristics: No. 7). (2) The gate-
keepers of Harivarṣa did not allow Arjuna
to enter the town (see above {@D.@} Characteri-
stics No. 6); they advised Arjuna to return;
he then told gate-keepers that he would not
enter the land that was prohibited for
human beings; he however asked for tri-
bute for Yudhiṣṭhira's Rājasūya sacrifice;
the gate-keepers then gave Arjuna heavenly
garments, ornaments and animal- and
deer-skins ({%na pravakṣyāmi vo deśaṃ%}

to Arjuna's conquering the northern direc-
tion and the Uttarakurus and making them
pay tribute; he also said that Arjuna
brought wealth from them and made them
[Page638-a+ 40]
join his army (which is not reported earlier
in 2. 25. 15-16) ({%diśam udīcīm api cotta-%}

brought down by waters flowing from
Uttarakurus, were brought for making
garlands as tribute to Yudhiṣṭhira by the
mountain peoples ({%uttarebhyaḥ kurubhyaś%}

2. 48. 6-7; (4) The Pāṇḍavas on their
way to Gandhamādana crossed the Uttara-
kurus and saw the Kailāsa mountain and
the {%āśrama%} of Nara and Nārāyaṇa in its
vicinity ({%te vyatītya … uttarāṃś ca kurūn%}

15-16; (5) After the miracle of the
meeting of the dead warriors with their
living relatives, brought about by Vyāsa,
the dead returned to the place from
where they came; some of them returned to
the Uttarakurus ({%svāni sthānāni bhejire //%}

15. {@F.@} Past events: The sage Gautama
offered king Dhṛtarāṣṭra (who was really
Indra) the world of the Uttarakurus in lieu
of his elephant but the latter refused to re-
turn the elephant and accept the Uttarakurus

(2) In the long, twelve-yearly sacrifice of
the sage Agastya, when a difficulty arose
due to famine, the sage just said that what-
ever wealth was found in the Uttarakurus
all that should appear of its own accord at
the place of his sacrifice, and it happened
just as he said ({%uttarebhyaḥ kurubhyaś ca%}
