{@Śreṇi@}¦ m. (pl.): Name of a people (?)
{@A.@} Description: Brought up in cow-
herds ({%gokule nityasaṃvṛddhāḥ%}) and
highly skilled in fighting ({%yuddhe parama-%}
{%kovidāḥ%}) 8. 4. 38. {@B.@} Epic event: At
night of the seventeenth day ({%niśi%} 8. 1.
25), Saṃjaya, while reporting the death
of Karṇa to Dhṛtarāṣṭra, mentioned
Śreṇis among those who were killed in
[Page892-b+ 38]
thousands by Arjuna during the war
({%śreṇayo bahusāhasrāḥ saṃśaptakagaṇāś%}
{%ca ye / te sarve pārtham āsādya gatā%}
{%vaivasvatakṣayam //%}) 8. 4. 38 (perhaps,
the word {%śreṇi%} does not refer to a people
but means only ‘lines, rows of troops’ and
refers to Gopālas who, though not directly
mentioned are suggested by the expression
({%gokule nityasaṃvṛddhāḥ%}) and by their
association with Saṃśaptakas, cf. Gopāla;
see, however, the next entry).
