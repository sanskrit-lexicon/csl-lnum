{%sadam // striyo 'pi yasyāṃ yudhyeyuḥ%}
{%kiṃ punar vṛṣṇipuṃgavāḥ%}) 2. 13. 50-51.
{@D.@} Epic events: (1) The Yādavas fled to
the west from Mathurā due to fear of
Jarāsandha and repaired to Kuśasthalī;
they settled down there and fortified the
town; they lived in Kuśasthalī without fear
from any quarter ({%akutobhayāḥ%}); seeing
the mountain (Raivataka) nearby and the
Mādhavītīrtha, the Yādavas were highly
delighted 2. 13. 49-52, 65; hence the city is
referred to as the residence of the Yāda-
vas ({%yadusadana%}) 8. 26. 63; (2) Hearing
that Śiśupāla was killed by Kṛṣṇa, Śālva,
[Page533-a+ 40]
during the absence of Kṛṣṇa from Dvā-
rakā, attacked the city riding in his Saubha
town; he killed young Vṛṣṇi heroes who
defended the city and destroyed all gardens
({%purodyānāni sarvāṇi bhedayām āsa durma-%}
{%tiḥ%}) 3. 15. 5-7; hearing that Śrautaśrava
(Śiśupāla) was killed, Śālva besieged Dvāra-
vatī from all sides; he mounted his Saubha,
flying in the sky, and from there attacked
the city; the fortification and the defence
arrangements of the city were looked after
by Gada, Sāmba, Uddhava and others
according to the rules laid down in the
Śāstras ({%śāstradṛṣṭena vidhinā saṃyūktā%});
drinking liquor was forbidden in the town
to avoid negligence on the part of citizens
({%āghoṣitaṃ ca nagare na pātavyā sureti ha /%}
{%pramādaṃ parirakṣadbhiḥ%}) 3. 16. 2-18;
Dvārakā was well guarded by king Āhuka by
giving largesses ({%dvārakā bhūridakṣiṇaiḥ /%}
{%āhukena suguptā ca rājñā%}) 3. 16. 23; Śālva
attacked Dvārakā with the speed of the king
of birds ({%abhisārayām āsa tadā vegena pata-%}
{%gendravat%}) 3. 17. 7; all the people in Dvārakā
were bewildered when Śālva descended on
the earth with his Saubha ({%saubhasthaṃ%}
{%pṛthivīgatam%}) 3. 17. 28; when Śālva was
defeated by the Vṛṣṇis led by Pradyumna
he left Dvārakā mounting his Saubha 3.
20. 27; (3) At the end of the Rājasūya
Kṛṣṇa wished to return to Dvārakā 2. 42.
46, 52; Yudhiṣṭhira approved of Kṛṣṇa's
return to Dvāravatī 2. 42. 49; when Kṛṣṇa
returned to Ānartanagara after the Rāja-
sūya of Yudhiṣṭhira at Indraprastha he saw
Dvārakā lack-lustre; it was bereft of the
sound of Vedic studies and Vedic sacrifices
({%ānartanagaraṃ muktaṃ tato 'ham agamaṃ%}
{%tadā / mahākratau rājasūye nivṛtte … //%}
{%apaśyaṃ dvārakāṃ cāhaṃ mahārāja hata-%}
[Page533-b+ 40]
{%tviṣam / niḥsvādhyāyavaṣaṭkāram%}); noble
women of the town did not put on orna-
ments; the gardens of Dvārakā were chang-
ed beyond recognition ({%anabhijñeyarūpāṇī%}
{%dvārakopavanānī ca%}); Kṛṣṇa found Vṛṣṇi-
pura with its men and women very much
ill at ease ({%asvasthanaranārīkam idaṃ vṛṣṇi-%}
{%puraṃ bhṛśam%}); the siege of Dvārakā by
Śālva and lifting of the siege later by him
was reported to Kṛṣṇa; enraged, he asked
the Yādava heroes to be watchful in the
city ({%apramādaḥ sadā kāryo nagare yāda-%}
{%varṣabhāḥ%}) and left for the destruction of
Śālva; he vowed not to return to Dvāravatī
without killing Śālva ({%nāhatvā taṃ nivar-%}
{%tiṣye purīṃ dvāravatīṃ prati%}) 3. 21. 1-9;
he asked Sātyaki, Baladeva, and Pradyumna
to protect Dvārakā and his father Vasudeva
3. 22. 16-17; during the fight with Śālva,
a certain resident of Dvārakā ({%puruṣaḥ%}
{%kaścid dvārakānilayaḥ%}), a servant ({%pari-%}
{%cārakaḥ%}) of Āhuka, met Kṛṣṇa and gave
him a false message from Āhuka; accord-
ing to the message Śālva had attacked
Dvārakā and killed the son of Śūrasena
(Vasudeva); hence Kṛṣṇa was advised to
leave the battle, return to Dvārakā and
protect it; that should be Kṛṣṇa's prime
concern ({%dvārakām eva rakṣasva kāryam%}
{%etan mahat tava%}) 3. 22. 12-14; Kṛṣṇa then
mentally blamed Sātyaki and others who
were entrusted with the protection of Dvā-
rakā and of Vasudeva 3. 22. 16-17; (Kṛṣṇa,
however, soon realized that he was tricked
by Śālva by his {%māyā%} and started to fight
with him again); he was incited to action
by his charioteer who reminded him that
Dvārakā was ransacked by Śālva ({%dvārakā%}
{%cāvamarditā%}) 3. 23. 25; (4) Kṛṣṇa told
Yudhiṣṭhira that he was not in Dvārakā
[Page534-a+ 40]
when the game of dice was played in Hās-
tinapura 3. 14. 1; he heard of the {%dyūta%}
only when he returned to Dvārakā after
vanquishing Śālva 3. 14. 15; (5) After
informing Yudhiṣṭhira in the forest about
Śālva's attacking Dvārakā and Kṛṣṇa's sub-
sequent battle with him, he comforted Yudhi-
ṣṭhira and returned to Dvārakā 3. 23. 42-45;
(6) Dvārakā was once burnt by Śiśupāla
when Kṛṣṇa and others had gone to Prāg-
jyotiṣapura 2. 42. 7; (7) Prophecies regard-
ing Dvārakā: (i) Nārāyaṇa told Nārada
that at the conjunction of Dvāpara and
Kali ({%dvāparasya kaleś caiva saṃdhau%} 12.
326. 82) he would be born at Mathurā
but would make Kuśasthalī (i. e. Dvārakā)
his residence ({%kuśasthalīṃ kariṣyāmi%}
{%nivāsaṃ dvārakāṃ purīm%}) 12. 326. 83-85;
while residing in that city he would kill
Naraka, Mura and Pīṭha 12. 326. 84; he
would also kill the demons and take the
wealth of Prāgjyotiṣapura to Kuśasthalī
({%prāgjyotiṣapuraṃ ramyaṃ nānādhana-%}
{%samanvitam / kuśasthalīṃ nayiṣyāmi%}) 12.
326. 85; having lessened the burden of the
earth he would bring about the destruction
of the Sātvata heroes, his kinsmen and of
Dvārakā ({%kṛtvā bhārāvataraṇaṃ vasu-%}
{%dhāyā yathepsitam / sarvasātvatamukhyā-%}
{%nāṃ dvārakāyāś ca sattama / kariṣye pra-%}

326. 92; (ii) prophesied also by Arjuna
that Dvārakā, which was made his home
by Kṛṣṇa, would be drowned in the sea by
him ({%dvārakām ātmasāt kṛtvā samudraṃ%}
{%gamayiṣyasi%}) 3. 13. 31; (iii) Kṛṣṇa too
had foretold that when Arjuna would leave
Dvārakā taking with him the citizens, the
city, together with its ramparts and watch-
towers, would be instantly inundated by the
[Page534-b+ 40]
sea ({%imāṃ ca nagarīṃ sadyaḥ pratiyāte dha-%}
{%naṃjaye / prākārāṭṭālakopetāṃ samudraḥ%}
{%plāvayiṣyati%}) 16. 7. 17; 16. 8. 10; (8) Des-
truction of Dvārakā: Arjuna advised all
people to leave the town at the end of a
week and stay outside 16. 8. 12; before
leaving Dvārakā, the citizens ({%dvārakāvāsi-%}
{%naḥ%}) attended the funeral of Vasudeva 16.
8. 19-23; when all people had left, the city
was overrun by the sea ({%sāgaraḥ … /dvāra-%}
{%kāṃ ratnasaṃpūṛṇāṃ jalenāplāvayat tadā //%})
16. 8. 40; the people of Dvārakā witnessed
the event the like of which had not happened
before ({%adbhutam%}) 16. 8. 41; the people of
Dvārakā who followed Arjuna to Indra-
prastha were handed over to Vajra 16. 8.
73: the Pāṇḍavas when they started on
their great final journey ({%mahāprasthāna%})
went, on their way, to the west and saw
Dvārakā inundated by the sea ({%dadṛśur%}
{%dvārakāṃ cāpi sāgareṇa pariplutām%}) 17. 1.
43; Arjuna's going to Dvāravatī, bereft of
the Vṛṣṇi heroes, and his taking with him
the people of Dvāravatī listed in the con-
tents of the Mausalaparvan 1. 2. 223, 226;
(9) After the Pāṇḍavas were established at
Indraprastha Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma left for
Dvāravatī with the consent of the Pāṇḍavas
1. 199. 50. (10) During the period of his
exile Arjuna went from Raivataka mountain
to Dvārakā; the city, even up to the modest
houses (?), was decorated to welcome
him ({%alaṃkṛtā dvārakā … api niṣkuṭakeṣv%}
{%api%}) 1. 210. 15-16 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 2.
218. 16: {%niṣkuṭeṣu gṛhārāmeṣv api alaṃkṛtā%}
{%kim uta rājamārgādiṣu%}); the people of
Dvārakā rushed to the main roads to see
Arjuna; women in large numbers rushed
to the windows (?) ({%avalokeṣu nārīṇām%}
{%sahasrāṇi śatāni ca%}); there was a great
[Page535-a+ 40]
gathering ({%samavāyo mahān abhūt%}) of the
Bhojas, the Vṛṣṇis and the Andhakas;

of Kṛṣṇa for many nights 1. 210. 17-21;
once, while Subhadrā was returning to Dvā-
rakā after worshipping Raivataka mountain
she was kidnapped by Arjuna; the helpless
soldiers cried aloud and ran towards Dvā-
rakā 1. 212. 7, 9; the incident is referred to
in 8. 26. 63; (11) The Yādavas, returned to
Dvāravatī after visiting Indraprastha where
they had gone to give gifts to the Pāṇḍa-
vas in connection with the marriage of
Subhadrā 1. 213. 55; Subhadrā's abduction
by Arjuna from Dvārakā referred to (i) in

in the contents of the Ādiparvan narrated
in the Parvasaṃgrahaparvan 1. 2. 92, (ii)
in Vaiśaṃpāyana's summary of the Mahā-

a messenger to Dvārakā to invite Kṛṣṇa,
living in Dvārakā, for consultations regard-
ing the Rājasūya 2. 12. 29; at the end of the
Rājasūya, Yudhiṣṭhira consented to Kṛṣṇa's
return to Dvāravatī; accordingly Kṛṣṇa
reached Dvāravatī 2. 42. 49, 55, 60; (14)
The sons of Draupadī, during the period of
exile of the Pāṇḍavas, went to Vṛṣṇipura
situated in the Ānarta country 3. 180. 25;
later, Satyabhāmā informed Draupadī that
her sons were all well and happy at Dvāra-
vatī 3. 224. 11; (15) Before going to the
Virāṭanagara for the {%ajñātavāsa,%} Yudhi-
ṣṭhira sent away Indrasena and others, with
their chariots, to Dvāravatī 4. 4. 3; the
spies, who were sent by Duryodhana in
[Page535-b+ 40]
search of the Pāṇḍavas, told him that the
charioteers of the Pāṇḍavas had reached
Dvāravatī but neither the Pāṇḍavas nor
Kṛṣṇā was to be found in Dvāravatī 4. 24.
15-16; (11) After the marriage of Abhi-
manyu, Kṛṣṇa, Balarāma and others, per-
mitted by Virāṭa, went to Dvārakā; after
Kṛṣṇa's departure to Dvārakā, Yudhiṣṭhira
started making all kinds of preparations
for the war ({%cakruḥ sāṅgrāmikaṃ sarvam%})
5. 5. 11-12; 5. 7. 1 (Dvāravatī); (12)
When Duryodhana knew through his messe-
ngers and spies that Kṛṣṇa had returned
to Dvārakā, he started to go there to seek
Kṛṣṇa's help in war; that very day Arjuna
too arrived in Ānartanagarī; both of them,
after reaching Dvārakā, saw Kṛṣṇa sleep-
ing 5. 7. 3 ({%ānartanagarīṃ ramyāṃ jagā-%}
{%māśu dhanaṃjayaḥ%}) 5. 7. 4, 5; (13) When
Balarāma started for his pilgrimage he, on
his way, asked his servants to bring from
Dvārakā all the materials and utensils
required for the pilgrimage, as also the
sacred fires and priests ({%saṃbhārāṃs tīrtha-%}
{%yātrāyāṃ sarvopakaraṇāni ca / ānayadhvaṃ%}
{%dvārakāyā agnīn vai yājakāṃs tathā%}) 9. 34.
15; when Balarāma chose to go to the
battlefield to watch the duel between
Bhīma and Duryodhana, he sent away his
co-pilgrims and attendants to Dvārakā 9.
53. 32; at the end of the duel, Balarāma,
expressing his disapproval of the way
Bhīma brought about the downfall of
Duryodhana, left for Dvārakā 9. 59. 26;

Dvāravatī, king Ugrasena came out of the
town to honour Arjuna who accompanied
[Page536-a+ 40]
the horse 14. 84. 13-15; when Yudhiṣṭhira
asked Kṛṣṇa to give some news about
Arjuna (who was accompanying the horse),
Kṛṣṇa told him that a confidential attendant
who lived in Dvārakā ({%dvārakāvāsī mamā-%}
{%ptaḥ puruṣaḥ%}) had seen him (Arjuna) who,
fighting many battles, was emaciated ({%bahu-%}
{%saṃgrāmakarśitam%}) 14. 88. 9; (15) After the
war, Kṛṣṇa informed Arjuna his intention
to return to Dvāravatī to meet his father,
Baladeva and others, if permitted by Yudhi-
ṣṭhira, but not otherwise; hence he wanted
Yudhiṣṭhira to be informed by Arjuna
about his wish to go to Dvārakā 14. 15.
20-21, 26, 31; before Kṛṣṇa's return to
Dvārakā, Arjuna wanted Kṛṣṇa to tell him
once again what he taught him before in the
Gītā 14. 16. 6-7; Arjuna approved Kṛṣṇa's
wish to return to Dvārakā; so he suggest-
ed that they should go to Hāstinapura to
seek Yudhiṣṭhira's permission for Kṛṣṇa's
return to Dvārakā 14. 50. 51; 14. 51. 23;

ssion to return to Dvāravatī to see his
father 14. 51. 42; Arjuna and others emb-
raced Kṛṣṇa when he left Hāstinapura to
go to Dvārakā 14. 52. 1; (16) Yudhiṣṭhira
was grieved to think of what Subhadrā, who
was then in Dvārakā ({%dvārakāvāsinī%}), would
say to Kṛṣṇa when he returned to Dvārakā
(since her son was killed in war) 12. 1. 16;
(17) Aśvatthāman once went to Dvārakā
where he stayed for some time honoured
by the Vṛṣṇis; he wanted to exchange his
Brahmaśiras missile for the Sudarśana of
Kṛṣṇa; while he was in Dvāravatī ({%vasan%}
{%dvāravatīm anu%}), one day he approached
Kṛṣṇa who was sitting alone on seashore;
[Page536-b+ 40]
Kṛṣṇa informed Aśvatthāman that none of
the Vṛṣṇi and the Andhaka heroes who lived
in Dvārakā had ever asked him to part with
his Sudarśana 10. 12. 11-12, 15, 31-33;
(18) The Yādavas, headed by Sāraṇa,
once saw Viśvāmitra, Kaṇva, Nārada and
other sages who were on a visit to Dvārakā
16. 2. 4; by the proclamation of a royal
decree Āhuka prohibited fermentation of
spirituous liquor in all the houses of Vṛṣṇis
and Andhakas living in the town (Dvārakā)
({%adyaprabhṛti sarveṣu vṛṣṇyandhakagṛheṣv-%}
{%iha / surāsavo na kartavyaḥ sarvair nagara-%}
{%vāsibhiḥ%}) 16. 2. 17-18; one of the bad
omens that occurred for the citizens of
Dvārakā was that a laughing black woman
with white teeth entered the houses at
night, stole the marriage threads of women
while they were asleep, and ran through
the streets of Dvārakā ({%kālī strī pāṇḍurair%}
{%dantaiḥ praviśya hasatī niśi /striyaḥ sva-%}

16. 4. 1 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 16. 3. 1: {%muṣṇantī%}
{%strīṇām maṅgalasūtrādikaṃ corayantī%});
when the Yādavas were destroyed, Kṛṣṇa
entered Dvāravatī and told Vasudeva to
guard the women folk and wait for the
arrival of Arjuna in Dvāravatī 16. 5. 7;
16. 7. 13; when Arjuna reached Dvārakā
with Dāruka the city appeared to him like
a woman who had lost her husband ({%mṛta-%}
{%nāthām iva striyam%}) 16. 6. 4; Arjuna, after
he witnessed the plight of Dvārakā and
the women of Kṛṣṇa he wept loudly and
fell down on the ground 16. 6. 12. {@E.@} Past
events or events not related to the epic
narrative: (1) Kṛṣṇa told Uttaṅka whom
he met on his way to Dvārakā that he
(Uttaṅka) should think of him (Kṛṣṇa)
if he desired something 14. 54. 13; Govinda
[Page537-a+ 40]
(Kṛṣṇa) gave boon to Uttaṅka and went
to Dvārakā in the company of Sātyaki
14. 58. 2, 3 (Dvāravatī); (2) Pious king
Nṛga, due to a sin unknowingly committed
by him (13. 69. 22; 13. 71. 2), had to live
as a lizard in a deep well at Dvāravatī 13.
69. 1-4; Kṛṣṇa liberated him when the
Yādavas were settling down at Dvāravatī
13. 71. 2-3; 13. 69. 25-29; (3) Śiva, in
the form of Durvāsas, lived for a long time
with Kṛṣṇa in his residence at Dvāravatī

ma the kind of gifts which one should
give under different {%nakṣatras (nakṣatra-%}
{%yogasyedānīṃ dānakalpaṃ bravīhi me);%}
Bhīṣma then told him what formerly Nārada,
who had arrived at Dvārakā, told Devaki
in reply to her question 13. 63. 1-4. {@F.@}
Dvārakā as a holy place: Described as
holy ({%puṇyā%}) 3. 86. 21; Yudhiṣṭhira, while
on a pilgrimage, visited Dvārakā ({%yac cāpi%}
{%tīrthāni carann agacchaṃ dvārakāṃ prati%})
7. 85. 63; a holy place Piṇḍāraka located
in Dvāravatī 3. 80. 82. {@G.@} Similes:
(1) The city Dvārakā was well protected
and well camouflaged and was furnished
with all kinds of weapons as is done for
the residence of Indra ({%surakṣitaṃ sugup-%}
{%taṃ ca sarvāyudhasamanvitam / tat puraṃ%}
{%bharataśreṣṭha yathendrabhavanaṃ tathā //%})
3. 16. 18; (2) As Indra left for heaven
after killing his enemies so did Kṛṣṇa leave
for Ānartapurī (when all the Kauravas
were killed) 14. 51. 56; (3) Dvārakā,
bereft of Vṛṣṇi heroes, compared with a
woman who had lost her husband ({%dvāra-%}
{%kāṃ … mṛtanāthāṃ iva striyam%}) 16. 6. 4;
(4) In a long drawn metaphor Dvārakā
compared to a river: the Vṛṣṇis and the
Andhakas were its water, horses its fishes,
[Page537-b+ 39]
chariots its boats, the sound of musical
instruments and the one produced by
chariots its current, residences and holy
bathing places its big crocodiles, jewels
its thick layer of moss, ramparts made of
{%vajra%} its garlands, streets its whirlpools,
cross-roads its steady, deep pieces of water,
Rāma and Kṛṣṇa its big sharks; this
river in the form of Dvārakā looked like
the terrible Vaitaraṇī river having the noose
of Kāla as its shark ({%tām sa vṛṣṇyan-%}
