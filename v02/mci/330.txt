{@Śakula@}¦ m.: A kind of fish.
<div n="P">Three of them, friends of one another,
lived together in a shallow pond which
[Page060-a+ 40]
abounded in fish; one of them was characteri-
zed as Prāptakālajña ‘who knows the proper
time (for action), who has the presence of
mind’ (also called Saṃpratipattijña, Prati-
pattimant, or Saṃpratipattimant 12. 135. 9,
13, 15), the other as Dīrghadarśin ‘who has
forethought’, and the third as Dīrghasūtra
‘who procrastinates’; seeing, once, the water
level falling down, Dīrghadarśin apprehended
danger and told his friends that they had
better quickly move out before their way to
get out was cut off; Dīrghasūtra agreed with
him but saw no reason to make haste;
Saṃpratipattijña, however, said that he
would not fail to take the correct course when
time arrived; then Dīrghadarśin, of great
intelligence, went out alone to a deep lake
following a water current; when the water in
the lake had thoroughly flown out the fisher-
men began to catch the fish by various
means; Dīrghasūtra got caught with others;
when the fish that were caught were being tied
to strings, Pratipattimant got himself mixed
with those that were tied already and he held
the string tight with his mouth (and thus
escaped being actually tied by the string);
when the fish, thus tied, were being washed
in dirt-free water, Saṃprattimant gave up
the string and escaped; the dull-witted and
of low intelligence Dīrghasūtra, however,
invited death on himself; thus one who does
not recognize the most opportune time is
destroyed like Dīrghasūtra; one like Saṃpra-
tipattimant, who does not provide for his
welfare in advance thinking himself to be
clever, meets with danger; who, like Dīrgha-
darśin, adopts proper course before the danger
sets in, attains great bliss; this excellent
{%ākhyāna%} ({%ākhyānam anuttamam%} 12. 135. 1)
pertaining to the subject of deciding what
[Page060-b+ 36]
should be done and what not was related by
Bhīṣma to Yudhiṣṭhira 12. 135. 1-19.
