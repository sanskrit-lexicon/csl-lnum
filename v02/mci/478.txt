{@Gāṇḍīva, Gāṇḍiva@}¦ nt.: Name of
Arjuna's bow (Gāṇḍiva recognized by
Kāśikā on P. 5. 2. 110, but very likely it
occurs {%m. c.%}).
{@A.@} Etymology: So called because it
was made of {%gāṇḍī,%} i. e. the bow was
covered with the skin of rhinoceros (?), or
[Page098-a+ 41]
because it was made of the backbone of rhin-
oceros (?) ({%eṣa gāṇḍīmayaś cāpaḥ … yatas%}

{%dhanur abhūt / … gāṇḍī vajragranthis tan-%}
{%maya ity anye%} (= Sarvajñanārāyaṇa) Nī.
on Bom. Ed. 5. 98. 19). {@B.@} Origin: It
was created by Brahman in very old times
({%purā%}) 1. 216. 17; 8. 50. 56; Indra fastened
an undecaying ({%ajarā%}) string on it when
Arjuna got ready to fight the Nivātakavacas
3. 165. 14; (however, Aśvatthāman cut it
off and Arjuna had to put a new string on
it 4. 54. 8). {@C.@} History: After its
creation, Brahman first held it for 1000
years, and then it was held successively by
Prajāpati for 800 years (?) or 503 years (?)
({%trīṇi pañcaśataṃ caiva%}), by Śakra for 85
years, by Soma for 500 years, by Varuṇa
for 100 years, and, up to the beginning
of the {%ajñātavāsa,%} it was with Arjuna for
65 years 4. 38. 39-41; it lay in the Varuṇa-
loka, perhaps in Varuṇa's lake, and was
guarded there by the gods 5. 96. 19; hence the
how was considered as properly belonging to
Varuṇa ({%vāruṇaṃ gāṇḍivam%}) 5. 155. 5;
(5. 59. 12); at the time of burning the
Khāṇḍava forest, Agni asked Varuṇa to give
Gāṇḍīva, which he had received from Soma,
to Arjuna since he was to perform great feats
with it; Varuṇa agreed to Agni's request 1.
216. 3-4; (17. 1. 39); when Arjuna received
it, he bowed to Agni, held the bow firmly, and
strung it; at that time there was a loud noise
1. 216. 17-20; 1. 55. 37; 3. 157. 20; 5. 155. 7;
according to another version Arjuna received
the bow, not before, but after he satisfied
god Fire 2. 44. 5; 8. 57. 41; Śaṅkara told
[Page098-b+ 41]
Arjuna that the Ganḍīva he now held was the
same which her as Nara, had used to chastise
the Daityas at the time of Indra's {%abhiṣeka%}
3. 41. 3-4. {@D.@} Association of Gāṇḍīva
with Arjuna 1. 1. 123; 5. 136. 5; it was
considered very suitable for Arjuna 2. 3. 6;
3. 41. 4; 8. 31. 55; hence Arjuna has epithets
like {%gāṇḍīvadhanvan%} 2. 54. 22; 3 34. 6; 3.

9. 23; 3. 41. 3; hearing (or non-hearing)
the sound meant different things on different
occasions: (1) hearing it Droṇa knew Arjuna
[Page100-b+ 41]
was proceeding towards Bhīṣma 6. 108. 14;
(2) Karṇa inferred that Arjuna must have
killed the Śibis and the Pauravas 7. 145. 45-
46; (3) Sātyaki concluded that Arjuna must
be nearby 7. 95. 9; (4) it became a rally-
ing point to Virāṭa, Drupada and other kings
6. 55. 115; (5) when not heard, Yudhiṣṭhira
became anxious about Arjuna's safety 7. 85.
37; 7. 102. 6; (6) Arjuna made the twang
of his bow ({%gāṇḍīvaṃ prākṣipat pāṛthaḥ%})
to express joy at the defeat of Karṇa by
Bhīma 7. 104. 31. {@G.@} Use by Arjuna:
1. Besides Arjuna, the bow (Gāṇḍiva)
could be strung only by Bhīma and Kṛṣṇa
3. 13. 69; but it was, in fact, used only by
Arjuna, hence blame could attach to
Gāṇḍiva of Arjuna if it was not used against
Duryodhana 3. 13. 70; 4. 20. 1; Arjuna's
association with Gāṇḍīva and dependence of
Pāṇḍavas' victory on it often stressed 1. 216
29; 2. 66. 12; 3. 6. 9; 4. 5. 17; 4. 38. 37;
5. 124. 2; 8. 69. 24; Arjuna owed a debt to
his bow from which he would be free by
killing Karṇa 8. 52. 23; Arjuna could wield
the bow with both hands equally dexterously
({%ubhau me dakṣiṇau pāṇī gāṇḍīvasya%}
{%vikarṣaṇe%}), hence he was called Savyasācin
4. 39. 17; 4. 56. 4; 4. 59. 12; 7. 51. 40;
Arjuna cleaned the bow-string and the bow
before use 8. 52. 2 ({%jyām anumṛjya%});
7. 18. 9 ({%gāṇḍīvam upasamṛjya%}); left
unstrung when it was not to be used for
a long time ({%apajyam akarot%}) 4. 5. 17;
when not held in hand (and left unstrung)
Gāṇḍīva gaped ({%anālabdhaṃ jṛmbhati%}
{%gāṇḍivaṃ dhanuḥ%}) 5. 47. 96; before putting
an arrow to the bow, Arjuna just touched
it (i. e. touched the bow-string) 8. 57. 15
({%saṃspṛśan gāṇḍivaṃ dhanuḥ%}), or stretched
it with force ({%balavat%} 7. 78. 36) ({%vy-ā-kṣip-,%}

57. 55; it as if flew in all directions like a
lightning 4. 58. 11; Arjuna recited {%mantras%}
on Gāṇḍīva, (the bow-string, and the arrows)
on special occasions: (1) while releasing the
{%vajra%}-like arrows by employing the {%vajra%}
missile of Indra against the Nivātakavacas
({%anumantrya ca gāṇḍīvam%}) 3. 169. 13-
14; (2) while shooting three arrows to
produce a pillow for Bhīṣma ({%āmantrya%}

water from the earth for Bhīṣma ({%śaraṃ%}
{%dīptam abhimantrya%}) 6. 116. 19-23; (4)
while using Aindrāstra to combat the Brah-

{%satyakriyā (anena satyena nihantv ayaṃ%}
{%śaraḥ)%} while shooting the arrow that killed
Karṇa 8. 67. 19-20; 2. After receiving
Gāṇḍīva from Varuṇa Arjuna must have
used it on all occasions; specific mention of
arrows or missiles released (or to be released)
from Gāṇḍīva (which went straight to the
target) is found at 3. 34. 83; 3. 172. 5; 3.

no one realized the time that elapsed
between Arjuna's drawing out the arrow
from the quiver, his putting it to the
bow, and discharging it from Gāṇḍīva 4.
57. 19; hence the arrows sped like mind
or wind ({%manonilasamā jave%}) 7. 53. 42;
({%ativegavantaḥ%}) 3. 252. 17; ({%śīghravegān%})
3. 252. 18; they appeared to follow each
other in close succession ({%saṃsaktā yānti%}
{%sāyakāḥ%}) 5. 164. 4; they appeared like the
rows of bees (and this was highly thought
of by Mātali) 3. 167. 22, or like a swarm
of moths (3. 252. 18); or like the rows of
swans in the sky 7. 121. 3; the arrows
released from Gāṇḍīva had the impact of
the thunderbolt of Indra ({%indrāśanisama-%}
{%sparśāḥ%}) 9. 23. 55; 9. 24. 2; 3. 169. 15
({%vajracoditā bāṇāḥ%}); or they shone like a
lightning ({%vajrāśanisamaprabhān%}) 14. 78.
27; ({%aśaniprākāśaiḥ%}) 4. 49. 22; the arrows
released from Gāṇḍīva were burning and pro-
duced fire 5. 56. 27; 5. 141. 42; 8. 52. 32;
4. 45. 23; 8. 46. 42; [also see the following
section]; {@3.@} Specific mention of the bow:
Arjuna must have used Gāṇḍīva on all
occasions (5. 53. 1) starting from its use
when Arjuna helped god Fire to burn the
Khāṇḍava forest (1. 217-219); the bow is
specifically mentioned by name when Arjuna
got ready to fight with Kirmīra 3. 12. 40;

weapons 3. 38. 15; lifted it to shoot at the
boar (Daitya Mūka) 3. 40. 9; fought with
Kirāta (Śaṅkara) 3. 40. 29; in this fight
the bow (not named) was swallowed by
[Page102-a+ 40]
Śaṅkara 3. 40. 39-40, and then returned to
Arjuna 3. 41. 4, 25; used while fighting
with the Nivātakavacas 3. 167. 6, 22; 3.
168. 23; 3. 169. 2; with Kālakeyas 3.
170. 40, 50; (at the time of cattle-raid)
while fighting with Karṇa 4. 49. 22; with
Kṛpa 4. 52. 3, 8; with Droṇa 4. 53. 28, 58;
at the start of the epic war Arjuna raised his
bow (Gāṇḍīva not named) while asking
Kṛṣṇa to station his chariot between the two
armies 6. 23. 20; out of dejection Gāṇḍīva
slipped down from Arjuna's hand 6. 23. 30;
but afterwards he used it successfully in the
war 6. 41. 1; he used it to attack Bhīṣma
6. 43. 9; 6. 81. 10; to fight with Suda-
kṣiṇa (a Kāmboja prince) 7. 67. 61; its use
against Jayadratha hinted 3. 252. 17, 18;
while forcing his way towards Jayadratha
1. 1. 137; Arjuna, with Gāṇḍīva in hand,
stood guard on the ground when, while mar-
ching towards Jayadratha, Kṛṣṇa refreshed
the horses 7. 74. 41; while aiming the arrow
at Jayadratha 7. 89. 17; to cut off Jaya-
dratha's head 7. 121. 3; while fighting with
Karṇa 7. 114. 82, 83, 87; 8. 68. 37; Arjuna
bent his bow ({%dhanur vināmya%}) while
boasting about himself 8. 49. 92; he used it to
fight with Aśvatthāman 9. 13. 26; to protect
Yudhiṣṭhira 9. 17. 6; to foil the attempt of
Śakuni's warriors to kill Sahadeva 9. 28. 3,
30; while fighting with Vajradatta (son of
Bhagadatta of Prāgjyotiṣa) 14. 74. 4, 5, 14;
and when Vajradatta's elephant attacked
Arjuna 14. 75. 10; at the end of the epic
war when the Pāṇḍavas reached the camp of
Duryodhana Kṛṣṇa asked Arjuna to unstring
the Gāṇḍīva 9. 61. 9; he used it while
fighting with Babhruvāhana 14. 78. 27;
with Meghasandhi (son of Jarāsandha)
14. 83. 11, 15; with the Mleccha armies
[Page102-b+ 40]
of the Vaṅga, the Puṇḍra, and the Kerala
countries 14. 83. 29-30; to fight with the
Dasyus 16. 8. 52, 58. {@H.@} Arjuna's
vow regarding Gāṇḍīva: It was Arjuna's
secret vow ({%upāṃśuvrata, vrata%}) to kill a
person who asked him to give away his
Gāṇḍīva to some one else 8. 49. 9, 61-62;
({%pratijñā%}) 8. 49. 11, 63; but the vow was
apparently known to Kṛṣṇa (8. 49. 61) and
to Yudhiṣṭhira 8. 49. 107-109 ({%pratijñā%});
Yudhiṣṭhira, in a fit of anger, asked Arjuna
to give away Gāṇḍīva to Kṛṣṇa and act as
his charioteer, and hence Yudhiṣṭhira's life
was in danger 8. 48. 14; 8. 49. 1. {@I.@} Com-
parisons: 1 (i) Arjuna with the stretched
Gāṇḍīva forming a full circle appeared like the
sun with a halo around it ({%yathaiva sūryaḥ%}
{%pariveṣagas tathā%}) 8. 57. 57; (ii) when
Arjuna released arrows using both hands,
Gāṇḍīva looked like a swinging wheel of
fire ({%agnicakram ivābaddham%}) 4. 59. 12;
(iii) in the sacrifice to be performed with
weapons ({%śastrayajña%}), Gānḍīva would serve
as a sacrificial ladle ({%sruc%}) 5. 139. 30;
2. Standard of comparison: (i) The
lustre of Rukmin's bow (Vijaya), obtained
from Mahendra, compared with that of
Gāṇḍīva 5. 155. 4; (ii) the sound ({%ghoṣa%})
of Abhimanyu's bow compared with that of
Gāṇḍīva 6. 45. 16 {@J.@} Defeat: 1. Occa-
sional: (i) When Arjuna's arrows had no
effect on the armour of Duryodhana, Kṛṣṇa
asked Arjuna whether his Gāṇḍīva had lost
its former force ({%prāṇāḥ%}) 7. 78. 7; (ii)
Jayadratha on one occasion succeeded in
piercing the Gāṇḍīva with three arrows
7. 121. 12; (iii) as long as Karṇa had his
armour, ear-rings, and the {%śakti,%} Arjuna, even
with his Gāṇḍīva, could not defeat Karṇa
7. 155. 17; 7. 155. 13-15; (iv) when
[Page103-a+ 39]
Aśvatthaman excelled Arjuna, Krṣṇa in
surprise asked him whether he still held the
Gāṇḍīva in his hand 8. 40. 124; (v) Gāṇ-
ḍīva dropped down from the hand of Arjuna
when Dhṛtavarman of the Trigartas hit
Arjuna on his hand with a sharp arrow
14. 73. 22-24 (picked up by Arjuna 14. 75.
24); (vi) when the Sindhu kings attacked
Arjuna and he swooned, Gāṇḍīva slipped
from his hand 14. 76. 21, (which he picked
up again 14. 76. 26); (vii) According to
Ulūka, Gāṇḍīva of no help to Arjuna at
the game of dice 5. 158. 28-29; 2. Final:
When Arjuna was taking with him the
Vṛṣṇi women to Hāstinapura, he was attacked
on way by the Dasyus; at that time Arjuna
could string the Gāṇḍīva with great effort
({%yatnād iva kathaṃcana; kṛcchreṇa%}) 16.
8. 52-53; his arrows were exhausted so
that Arjuna had to strike the Dasyus with
the tip of the bow ({%dhanuṣkoṭyā%}) 16. 8.
58-60, 63 ({%dhanuṣaś cāvidheyatvāt%}); 16.
9. 17-18; this was the defeat of Gāṇḍīva
({%gāṇḍīvasya parābhavam%}) 1. 2. 226. {@K.@}
Returned to Varuṇa: When the Pāṇḍavas
started for the forest, Arjuna would not
leave his bow and quivers behind; Agni, who
had burnt the Khāṇḍava, asked Arjuna
to abandon the bow as it had no further
purpose to serve; Agni got it from Varuṇa
for Arjuna, hence Arjuna should return it
to Varuṇa; at the instance of his brothers,
Arjuna dropped the bow and the quivers into
the water 17. 1. 32, 36-37, 39-40.
