{@Śākadvīpa@}¦ nt. (sg.): Name of one of
the seven Dvīpas.
{@A.@} Location and extent: According
to Draupadī, it was similar to Krauñca-
dvīpa and lay to the east of Mahāmeru;
the Dvīpa known as Bhadrāśva which lay
to the north of Mahāmeru was in extent
equal to Śākadvīpa ({%krauñcadvīpena sa-%}
{%dṛśaḥ śākadvīpo … /pūrveṇa tu mahā-%}
{%meroḥ … uttareṇa mahāmeroḥ śākadvīpena%}
{%saṃmitaḥ / bhadrāśvaḥ … //%}) 12. 14 23-24;
according to Saṃjaya, Śākadvīpa was
double the size of Jambūdvīpa and the
ocean which surrounded it was also double
its size ({%jambūdvīpapramāṇena dviguṇaḥ%}
{%sa … /viṣkambheṇa mahārāja sāgaro'pi%}
{%vibhāgaśaḥ / kṣīrodo bharataśreṣṭha yena%}
{%saṃparivāritaḥ%}) 6. 12. 9; Śākadvīpa was
larger than Jambūdvīpa both in length
and breadth ({%parivārya tu kauravya dair-%}
{%ghyaṃ hrasvatvam eva ca / jambūdvīpena%})
6. 12. 25. {@B.@} Some geographical details of
the Śākadvīpa: There are seven mountains
on Śākadvīpa (Meru, Malaya, Jaladhāra,
Raivataka, Śyāma, Durgaśaila and Kesarī);
the mountains are described in 6. 12. 13-
21 (for which see Vol. I, section 5); the
Varṣas related to these mountains are
detailed in 6. 12. 22-24. {@C.@} Possible
[Page883-a+ 40]
explanation of the name: {@A@} famous
big tree named Śāka stood in its middle
(that was why probably the Dvīpa was so
called) ({% … vikhyātas tasya madhye mahā-%}
{%drumaḥ //śāko nāma mahārāja tasya%}
{%dvīpasya madhyagaḥ /%}) 6. 12. 25-26.
{@D.@} Description of the countries and the
peoples of Śākadvīpa: Highly lustrous
({%mahaujas%}) 6. 12. 37; the Janapadas on
this Dvipa were holy; famine was not
known; the people were endowed with for-
bearance and lustre; they did not die ({%tatra%}
{%puṇyā janapadā%} (also 6. 12. 33) {%na tatra%}
{%mriyate janaḥ / kuta eva hi durbhikṣaṃ%}
{%kṣamātejoyutā hi te //%}) 6. 12. 10; God
Śaṅkara was worshipped there ({%pūjyate%}
{%tatra śaṃkaraḥ%}); Siddhas, Cāraṇas and
various deities visited it ({%tatra gacchanti%}
{%siddhāś ca cāraṇā daivatāni ca%}) 6. 12 26-
27; all the four kinds of subjects were
highly religious ({%dhārmikāś ca prajā … %}
{%catvāro 'tīva … %}) 6. 12. 27; the Varṇas
followed their respective duties; they
were long-lived, free from oldage and
death; they multiplied like the rivers in
the rainy season ({%prajās tatra vivardhante%}
{%varṣāsv iva samudragāḥ%}) 6. 12. 28-29;
no thief was ever met with there ({%na ca%}
{%steno'tra dṛśyate%}) 6. 12. 28; there was
no king, no punishment, nor the officers to
inflict punishment ({%na tatra rājā rājendra%}
{%na daṇḍo na ca daṇḍikāḥ%}); by following
their respective {%dharmas%} the people pro-
tected it and also protected one another
({%svadharmeṇaiva dharmaṃ ca te rakṣanti%}
{%parasparam%}) 6. 12. 36; the four holy Jana-
padas on the Dvīpa, honoured in the worlds
({%lokasaṃmatāḥ%}), are known as Maga,
Maśaka, Mānasa and Mandaga; they are
described 6, 12. 33-36; the holy rivers
[Page883-b+ 40]
on the Śākadvīpa are Gaṅgā, flowing in
various streams ({%bahudhāgatiḥ%}), Sukumārī,
Kumārī, Sītā, Kāverakā, Mahānadī, Maṇi-
jalā, and Ikṣuvardhanikā; several hundreds
and thousands of holy rivers arose from
them, from the waters of which Indra gave
rain ({%yato varṣati vāsavaḥ%}); it is not
possible to name them all nor to describe
their extent; all these excellent rivers are
holy ({%na tāsāṃ nāmadheyāni parimāṇaṃ%}
{%tathaiva ca / śakyate parisaṃkhyātuṃ%}
{%puṇyās tā hi saridvarāḥ%}) 6. 12. 29-32.
{@E.@} Epic events: (1) Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked
Saṃjaya to describe to him the Śāka-
dvīpa; Saṃjaya agreed and described it
in brief ({%śākadvīpasya saṃkṣepo … %}) 6.
12. 2, 11; on Dhṛtarāṣṭra's further request
to describe the Dvīpa in details ({%vistaram%})
Saṃjaya described it in some detail which
was worth hearing ({%etāvad eva śrotavyam%});
that was about all that Saṃjaya could tell
about the Dvīpa 6. 12. 12, 37; (2) In
order to revive the spirits of Yudhiṣṭhira
after the war, Draupadī reminded him that
formerly he had passed through the ocean
and brought under control various large
Dvīpas including the Śākadvīpa and the
islands in-between and the Janapadas
situated on them ({%śākadvīpo … / … daṇḍena%}

reference to Arjuna's expedition before the
Rājasūya 2. 23. 15-16; Nīlakaṇṭha on Bom.
