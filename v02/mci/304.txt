{@Vālin@}¦ m.: A monkey-chief, ruler of
Kiṣkindhā.
{@A.@} Family relations: Son of Śakra
(Indra) 3. 147. 25; Sugrīva, his brother
3. 12. 47; 3. 147. 27; 3. 154. 49; 3. 263. 41;
3. 264. 19 ({%bhrātṛgandhika%} ‘brother only
in name, not having brotherly affection’);
his wife Tārā 3. 264 16. 18; Aṅgada, his
son 3. 266. 27; 3. 272. 14, 17; Suṣeṇa, his
father-in-law 3. 267. 2. {@B.@} Description:
Wore a golden garland ({%hemamālin%}) 3. 263.
41; 3. 264. 18; eloquent ({%vāgmin%}) 3. 264.
18. {@C.@} Status: King and chief of the
monkeys 3. 263. 41 ({%vānararāja%}); 3. 147. 25
({%vānararājan%}); 3. 264. 18 ({%vānarapati%}); 3.
264. 20, 25 ({%kapīśvara%}); 3. 154. 49 ({%kapi-%}
{%siṃha%}); he, with Sugrīva, was waited upon
by all leaders of monkeys 3. 147. 25, 26; he
maintained a large and flourishing forest
called {%madhuvana%} 3. 266. 26. {@D.@} Encounter
[Page053-b+ 41]
with Rāma: Sugrīva, for some reason, was
offended ({%nikṛtaḥ … kasmiṃśeit kāraṇāntare%}
3. 147. 27) by Vālin; Rāma advised to take
Sugrīva's help for the recovery of Sītā
3. 263. 39; Rāma and Sugrīva entered
into an agreement: Rāma promised to
kill Vālin and Sugrīva in return promised
help in winning back Sītā 3. 264. 14-15;
when Sugrīva challenged Vālin he was not
able to stand the roars of Sugrīva; Tārā,
his wife, tried to dissuade him from going out
to punish Sugrīva; Vālin asked her to find out
and tell him whose help Sugrīva had secured;
she told him about the friendship between
Rāma and Sugrīva based on having enemies
for similar reasons (both deprived of their
wives) ({%tulyārimitratāṃ prāptaḥ sugrīveṇa%}
{%dhanurdharaḥ (rāmaḥ)%} 3. 264. 21); Vālin
disregarded Tārā's advice; he suspected her of
secretly loving Sugrīva, scolded her, and went
out of his cave ({%guhāmukha%} 3. 264. 26); he
reminded Sugrīva that he was defeated on
several occasions before but was spared be-
cause he was Vālin's kinsman ({%mukto jñātir%}
{%iti jñātvā%} 3. 264. 27); the two brothers
fought a duel with {%śāla%} and palm trees, and
rocks; they also used their fists, nails and
teeth; it was not possible to distinguish between
the two, hence Hanūmant stuck a garland on
Sugrīva's neck; Rāma was then able to single
out Vāli (3. 264. 35) for his target and
shoot an arrow on his chest; with his vitals
pierced and vomitting blood Vālin saw Rāma
at a distance; he blamed Rāma (for shoot-
ing him that way) and fell unconscious on the
ground; after Vālin's death Sugrīva received
the kingdom of Kiṣkindhā and also Tārā 3.
264. 14-39; 3. 147. 32; Vālin killed by Rāma
for the sake of Sugrīva 3. 266. 7; {@E.@} Com-
parison: Fight between Bhīma and Kirmīra
compared with that of Vālin and Sugrīva 3.

12. 47; fight between Bhīma and Jaṭāsura also
so compared 3. 154. 49.
