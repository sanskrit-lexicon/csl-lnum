{%pariṣkṛtām%}) 1. 212. 11. {@C.@} Management:
The Sabhā was supervised by a Sabhāpāla
whose duty was to beat the drum and alert
the citizens in the event of an emergency
(see the next). {@D.@} Purpose: Whenever
an emergency arose the Sabhāpāla beat
the {%bherī%} to produce loud sound; hearing
it, the agitated Bhojas, Vṛṣṇis and Andha-
kas would leave aside their food and drink
and rush to the Sabhā to know the nature
of the emergency 1. 212. 11-12. {@E.@} Epic
events: (1) When Subhadrā was forcibly
abducted by Arjuna, the soldiers accom-
panying her rushed to the Sudharmā Sabhā
and acquainted the Sabhāpāla with what
had happened; when the Vṛṣṇi heroes who
gathered in the Sabhā sat down on the
royal seats, the Sabhāpāla told them about
the abduction of Subhadrā by Arjuna 1.
212. 9-10, 15; (2) After the mutual kill-
ings by the Yādavas, when Arjuna reached
Dvārakā he entered the Sudharmā to meet
the ministers of the Vṛṣṇi heroes; when he
occupied a seat in the Sabhā the citizens
[Page580-b+ 39]
gathered around him 16. 8. 7-8. {@F.@} Compa-
rison: Sudharmā was not equal to the
unrivalled Sabhā constructed by Maya for
the Pāṇḍavas ({%sabhā tu sā mahārāja … %}
