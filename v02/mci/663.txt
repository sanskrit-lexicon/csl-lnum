218-219; in this {%parvan%} Dhṛtarāṣṭra, with
Gāndhārī and Vidura, left the capital and
went to the hermitage; they were followed
by Pṛthā (Kuntī); in this hermitage the
king saw, by the favour of the sage Kṛṣṇa
(Vyāsa), his sons, grand-sons, and other
kings and heroes, who were killed in battle,
come back again; that was a wonder
unsurpassed ({%āścaryam anuttamam%} 1. 2.

abandoned grief and obtained high perfection
({%siddhiṃ paramikāṃ gataḥ%} 1. 2. 215); in
this {%parvan,%} we hear of Vidura and Saṃjaya
going to the next world; in this {%parvan,%}
