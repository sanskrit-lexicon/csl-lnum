{@Sāman@}¦ nt. (mostly plural): Stands for
the Sāmaveda, or a hymn or stanzas of that
Veda (in this sense it often occurs along with
{%ṛc%} and {%yajus%}); a melody in which the stanzas
of the Sāmaveda are sung.
{@A.@} Relationship with Bhagāvān: Bhaga-
vān told Arjuna that those who knew the
Veda called him the Sāmaveda of a thousand
branches ({%māṃ pracakṣate / sahasraśākhaṃ%}
{%yat sāma ye vai vedavido janāḥ%}) 12. 330.
32; in the stanzas of the Sāmaveda, as in the
other three Vedas and many other texts, many
names of Bhagavān have been enumerated by
the great sages ({%ṛgvede sayajurvede tathai-%}
{%vātharvasāmasu / … bahūni mama nāmāni%}
{%kīrtitāni maharṣibhiḥ%}) 12. 328. 8. {@B.@} Sing-
ing of {%sāman%} as daily routine: The {%āśrama%}
of Dadhīca on the other bank of Sarasvatī
hummed with the sound of bees as with the
chantings of {%sāman-%} singers ({%ṣaṭpadodgīta-%}
{%ninadair vighuṣṭṃ sāmagair iva%}) 3. 98. 13;
on the Gandhamādana mountain the Pāṇḍavas
[Page215-b+ 40]
could hear the sound of the songs and of the
clapping of hands (by the Gandharvas and the
Kiṃpuruṣas) which sounded like the melody
of the {%sāman%} chants ({%gītānāṃ talatālānāṃ%}
{%yathā sāmnāṃ ca nisvanaḥ%}) 3. 155. 84; the
precincts of the {%āśrama%} of Upamanyu
resounded with the auspicious melodies of
{%sāman%}-singers ({%śubhaiḥ sāmagānāṃ%}
{%ca vīra%}) 13. 14. 35. {@C.@} Employment
in sacrifices: In the Rājasūya of Yudhiṣṭhira
the six fires were piled up with the chanting
of {%sāman%} by those who had observed the
vows ({%sāmnā ṣaḍagnayo yasmiṃś cīyante%}
{%saṃśitavrataiḥ%}) 2. 12. 13; in this sacrifice
Susāman, the chief of the Dhanaṃjayas,
acted as the chanter of the {%sāmans%} 2. 30. 34
({%dhanaṃjayānāṃ ṛṣabhaḥ susāmā sāmago%}
{%'bhavat /%}) Nī. on Bom. Ed. 2. 33. 34:
{%dhanaṃjayānāṃ dhanaṃjayagotrāṇāṃ ma-%}
{%dhye śreṣṭhaḥ susāmā nāma āṅgirasaḥ%});
in the sacrifice of Janaka the excellent Ukthya
sāman was sung 3. 134. 36; Bhīṣma told
Yudhiṣṭhira that in a sacrifice the {%sāman-%}
singers praise employing the Rathantara
melody ({%rathantare sāmagāś ca stuvanti%})
13. 143. 15; Ṛṣi Gṛtsamada told Yudhiṣṭhira
that once, when Indra's long sacrificial session
lasting for a thousand years was in progress,
Vasiṣṭha, the son of Manu Cākṣuṣa, found
fault the way Gṛtsamada was singing the
Rathantara chant; Vasiṣṭha asked Gṛtsamada
to set his jubilation aside and again think
over what he had done ({%rathantaraṃ dvija-%}
{%śreṣṭha na samyag iti vartate / samīkṣasva%}
{%punar buddhyā harṣaṃ tyaktvā dvijottama%});
(he charged Gṛtsamada that by his in-
correct singing he had committed a sin which
would not carry the sacrifice to the gods;
for this fault Gṛtsamada was cursed to be
a deer) 13. 18. 15-17; Vālmīki told Yudhi-
[Page216-a+ 40]
ṣṭhira that in a certain dispute regarding
{%sāman%} (-chanting) the sages pronounced the
judgement that Vasiṣṭha had incurred the sin
of killing a Brāhmaṇa and he was instantly
seized by that sin ({%vīvāde sāmni munibhir%}
{%brahmaghno vai bhavān iti /uktaḥ kṣaṇena%}
{%cāviṣṭas tenādharmeṇa bhārata%}) 13. 18. 7.
Trita, when he wanted to offer a sacrifice in
the well, thought of {%ṛcs, yajuses%} and {%sāmans%}
for using them in the rites 9. 35. 33; in the
metaphorical sacrifice ({%saṃgrāmayajña%} 12.
99. 12) performed by a warrior (i. e. in a
war) the words ‘cut, break’ uttered by the
fighters in a war serve the purpose of the
{%sāmans%} chanted by the {%sāman-%} singers in the
abode of Yama (cf. the next section {@D@})
({%chindhi bhindhīti yasyaitac chrūyate vāhinī-%}
{%mukhe / sāmāni sāmagās tasya gāyanti%}
{%yamasādane%}) 12. 99. 22; {%sāmans%} were sung
when formerly animals were bound for god
Nārāyaṇa—this is mentioned in the {%ṛcs%}
recited by those who know Nārāyaṇa and
these are cited as an instance ({%ṛcaś cāpy%}
{%atra śaṃsanti nārāyaṇavido janāḥ nārā-%}
{%yanāya devāya yad abdahnan paśūn purā //%}
{%tatra sāmāni gāyanti tāni cāhur nidarśa-%}
{%nam //%}) 14. 25. 16-17 (see however Nī. cited
under {%ṛc%} p. 175. 2 above). {@D.@} Employ-
ment in funeral rites: When the Pāṇḍavas
set out for the forest Dhaumya, their Puro-
hita, accompanied them chanting on the way
the terrible {%sāmans%} addressed to Yama and

wards the Nairṛtya direction ({%dhaumyo%}
{%yāmyāni sāmāni raudrāṇi ca viśāṃ pate /%}
{%gāyan gacchati mārgeṣu kuśān ādāya%}
{%pāṇinā //%}) 2. 71. 7 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 2. 80.
7: {%yāmyāni yamadaivatyāni%}); ({%kṛtvā tu%}
{%nairṛtān darbhān dhīro dhaumyaḥ puro-%}
{%hitaḥ / sāmāni gāyan yāmyāni purato yāti%}
[Page216-b+ 40]
{%bhārata%}) 2. 71. 21 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 2. 80.
22: {%nairṛtān nirṛtikoṇagān%}); he thereby
wanted to indicate that when the Bhāratas will
be killed in the war the priests of the Kurus
will similarly chant the {%sāmans%} (addressed to
Yama) 2. 71. 22; at the cremation of Droṇa
the {%sāman%}-singers sang three {%sāmans%} when
his body was placed on the funeral pyre
({%droṇam ādhāya gāyanti trīṇi sāmāni%}
{%sāmagāḥ%}) 11. 23. 38; when the pyre was lit,
others followed them reciting the three {%sāmans%}
in subdued voices (see Cr. Ed. Vol. 12.
p. 119 note on 11. 23. 41) ({%sāmabhis tribhir%}
{%antaḥsthair anuśaṃsanti cāpare / agnāv%}
{%agnim ivādhāya droṇaṃ hutvā hutāśane%})
11. 23. 41; {%sāmans%} were sung at the Pitṛ-
medha rites of some of those fallen in the war;
due to the sound of the {%sāmans%} and the {%ṛcs,%}
as also due to the lamentations of women, all
beings were stupefied during the night ({%pitṛ-%}
{%medhāś ca keṣāṃcid avartanta mahātmanām /%}
{%sāmabhiś cāpy agāyanta … // sāmnāṃ ṛcāṃ%}
{%ca nādena strīṇāṃ ca ruditasvanaiḥ / kaśma-%}
{%laṃ sarvabhūtānāṃ niśāyām samapadyata%})
11. 26. 39-40; at the Pitṛmedha rites of
Bhīṣma the {%sāman%}-singers sang the chants
13. 154. 12; during the Pitṛmedha rites, at
the cremation of Vasudeva, when the funeral
pyre was lit there was a loud sound produced
by the {%sāman%}-singers ({%sāmagānāṃ ca%}

the praise of deities: (1) Indra: Arjuna saw
Indra praised by excellent {%dvijas%} with praises
consisting of {%ṛcs, yajuses%} and {%sāmans%} 3. 44.
18; when Arjuna and Indra sat on the same
throne, Gandharvas led by Tumburu, skilled
in songs and chants, sang {%gāthās%} in very
agreeable melody ({%tatra sma gāthā gāyanti%}
{%sāmnā paramavalgunā / gandharvās tumbu-%}
{%ruśreṣṭhāḥ kuśalā gītasāmasu%}) 3. 44. 28;
[Page217-a+ 40]
(2) Kubera: On the Gandhamādana
mountain the sound of {%sāman-%} singing by
Tumburu, who waits on Dhanada (Kubera)
was heard on the junctions of the four changes
of the moon ({%parvasadhiṣu%}) 3. 156. 28;
(3) Śiva: Upamanyu in his praise of Śiva
said that the god was sung with chants by the
{%sāman%}-singers ({%sāmabhir yaṃ ca gāyanti%}
{%sāmagāḥ śuddhabuddhayaḥ%}) 13. 16. 49;
Śatakratu (Indra) and Viṣṇu (who are the
two sons of Aditi), and god Brahman sing the
Rathantara melody near Bhava (Śiva) ({%śata-%}
{%kratus ca bhagavān viṣṇuś cāditinandanau /%}
{%brahmā rathantaraṃ sāma īrayanti bhāvā-%}
{%ntike%}) 13. 15. 16; (however, the Editor's note,
Cr. Ed. Vol. 17, p. 1061 on 13. 15. 16, says:
{%aditinandanau%} = Mitra and Varuṇa ?) (4)
Deity not named: in the south, in the bowers
of Mandara mountain and in the houses of
the Viprarṣis, the Gandharvas sing enchanting
{%gāthās%} sung in different melodies ({%gandha-%}
{%rvā gānti gāthā vai cittabuddhiharā dvija /%}
{%atra sāmāni gāthābhiḥ śrutvā gītāni //%})
5. 107. 9-10. {@F.@} Importance: While des-
cribing his {%vibhūtis,%} Bhagavān told Arjuna
that he was the Bṛhatsāman chant among the
melodies ({%bṛhatsām tathā sāmnām%}) 6. 32.
35; Bhīṣma praised Kṛṣṇa-Nārāyaṇa, who is
sung in {%sāmans%} that are true, as one whose
actions are true and who is truth ({%yaṃ … %}
{%gṛṇanti satyakarmāṇaṃ satyaṃ satyeṣu%}

ṣṭhira: “What is the one {%sāman%} suited for
sacrifice ?” Yudhiṣṭhira replied: “Prāṇa is
the one {%sāman%} suited for sacrifice” ({%kim%}

were neither {%sāmans, yajuses%} nor {%ṛcs%} in the
Kṛtayuga ({%nāsan kṛtayuge tāta … na sāma-%}
