{@Lapitā@}¦ f.: A female Śārṅgikā bird.
<div n="P">The great sage Mandapāla, turned into
a {%Śārṅgaka%} bird, first approached the Śārṅ-
gikā Jaritā, but later transferred his attention
to Lapitā 1. 220. 17; at the time of the
Khāṇḍava fire, when Mandapāla expressed
[Page050-a+ 40]
his anxiety about the safety of his young
ones, Lapitā became jealous and said that
Mandapāla was not really anxious for his
young sons but for Jaritā, his first love;
she knew that his children were powerful,
lustrous, and able speakers; they need have
no fear from fire; moreover Mandapāla had
in her presence secured an assurance from
god Agni that he would not harm Manda-
pāla's children; Lapitā therefore was sure
that Mandapāla was really worried about
Jaritā, her foe; she charged Mandapāla that
he did not love her as he loved Jaritā and
asked him to go to Jaritā and leave her alone
1. 224. 2-13.
