{@Droṇa@}¦ m.: A {%Śārṅgaka%} bird.
{@A.@} Birth: Fourth son of the sage
Mandapāla (turned a {%Śārṅgaka%} bird) and
{%Śārṅgikā%} Jaritā 1. 221. 9; 1. 220. 16, 17;
abandoned by the father when he and his
brothers were still in the eggs (1. 220. 17),
but not abandoned by their mother 1. 220. 19.
{@B.@} Learning and Status: Mandapāla ex-
pected his son Droṇa to become an excellent
knower of {%brahman (brahmavid uttamaḥ%})
1. 221. 9; 1. 225. 3; he became a seer ({%ṛṣi%})
1. 220, 19; Agni knew him as such and
[Page031-b+ 40]
recognized what Droṇa said in praise of
him as {%brahman%} 1. 223. 21; 1. 225. 3; Agni
addressed him as {%vibhu%} and {%brahman%} 1.
223. 23. {@C.@} Khāṇḍava fire: Manda-
pāla had already secured from god Agni
assurance regarding safety of his children;
this was not known to them 1. 220. 21, 31,
32; when the forest was on fire Droṇa and his
brothers were abandoned by their mother
when they did not act on her advice and enter
a hole to save themselves from fire 1. 223 10,
16; Droṇa noticed the advancing fire 1. 223.
5; all the {%Śārṅgaka%} brothers started praising
Agni; when his turn came Droṇa praised god
Fire and requested him to move away and not
touch them as he would not touch the houses
in the ocean (? {%sāgarasya gṛhān iva%}) 1. 223.
16-19 (Nīla. {%nadīpravāhān iva anabhi-%}
{%bhāvyān svābhibhāvakāṃś ca%} on 1. 232. 19
Bom. Ed.); Agni informed Droṇa that
Mandapāla had already interceded on their
behalf and further that he was highly pleased
with Droṇa's praise; Agni asked Droṇa what
he could do for all of them; Droṇa requested
him to finish the cats and their relatives who
posed a constant threat to their existence 1.
223. 22-24; when the fire subsided, Jaritā
returned to her sons and was happy to see
them safe 1. 224. 17-19; Mandapāla, too,
remembered his sons and returned to them 1.
224. 6, 14, 20; Droṇa and his brothers neither
greeted him nor answered his questions 1. 224.
20-22; but in the end all were reconciled
1. 224. 32; 1. 225. 1-4.
