Eminence: Mentioned as chief or excellent
among the monkeys: {%kapīśvara%} 3. 148. 1;
{%vānarādhipati%} 3. 146. 64; {%vānaravara%} 3.
146. 71, (7. 80. 9); {%harivara%} 3. 150. 16;

{@D.@} Status: He was one of the four coun-
cillors of Sugrīva (3. 263. 41); 3. 264. 10,
23; 3. 266. 65; he specially became friendly
with Sugrīva 3. 147. 26. {@E.@} Meeting
with Bhīma: When Bhīma was wandering on
the peaks of the Gandhamādana mountain in
search of heavenly lotus flowers having
heavenly fragrance, he made big noise with his
conch near the thicket of banana trees; hear-
ing it, the lions and the elephants roared; the
[Page081-a+ 40]
big noise aroused Hanūmant who was asleep
in the thicket; as he woke up, yawning, he
hit the ground with his large tail which looked
like the flag staff of Indra and produced
sound like a thunder; when Bhīma marched
forward to search the source of this sound
he saw Hanūmant lying on a thick stone-
slab in the midst of the banana trees 3. 146.
59-64; description of Hanūmant 3. 146. 65-
71; when Bhīma roared loudly Hanūmant
opened his eyes a little, looked despisingly
at Bhīma, and asked Bhīma why he woke
him up who was happily asleep; he told
Bhīma that as an intelligent human being
Bhīma should have shown compassion for
other beings; Bhīma therefore did not know
his {%dharma;%} Hanūmant then asked Bhīma
the purpose of his arriving at a place which
was not supposed to be visited by human
beings; the mountain, beyond that point, could
not be crossed unless one had acquired per-
fection ({%siddhagati%} 3. 146. 79); Hanūmant
advised Bhīma to eat the roots and fruits
to be found there which were as good as
{%amṛta%} and return 3. 146. 72-81; when Bhīma
introduced himself to Hanūmant as a Pāṇ-
ḍava and son of Vāyu, Hanūmant responded
with a smile but asked Bhīma to return rather
than proceed further and meet with danger;
when Bhīma insisted that he must proceed
and for that purpose Hanūmant should get
away from his path, Hanūmant replied that
it was not possible for him to move as he was
suffering from an ailment; if Bhīma must pro-
ceed he should cross over him; when Bhīma
said he was prepared to go beyond him and
the mountain as Hanūmant had crossed the
ocean, Hanūmant asked Bhīma who was that
Hanūmant, Bhīma replied that Hanūmant
was his brother, meritorious, brave and in-
[Page081-b+ 40]
telligent, famous in the Rāmāyaṇa; he crossed
the ocean to find out Rāma's wife; knowing
Bhīma to be arrogant due to the strength of
his arms, Hanūmant again told him that as he
could not move due to old age Bhīma should
set aside his tail from the path and proceed;
Bhīma failed in his attempt to lift the tail
and stood with his face turned down due to
shame; he bowed down to Hanūmant asking
for forgiveness; Bhīma requested Hanūmant
to reveal his identity and let him know whether
he was a {%siddha,%} a god, a Gandharva, or a
Guhyaka in the form of a monkey 3. 147.
17-22; Hanūmant then told Bhīma who he
really was and that he used to live with
Sugrīva on the Ṛśyamūka mountain since
the latter was cheated by his brother Vālin
3. 147. 27; Hanūmant further told Bhīma
that he had gone out with other crores of
monkeys in search of Sītā and was informed
by a vulture (Jaṭāyus) about Sītā; he had
then jumped over the ocean, one hundred
{%yojanas%} wide, seen Sītā in Rāvaṇa's house,
and returned after announcing himself to
Rāvaṇa; when Rāma finally started (for
Ayodhyā) Hanūmant had asked the following
boon from Rāma: “May I live as long as the
story of Rāma lasts”; the boon was granted
to him; Gandharvas and Apsarases sing the
narrative of Rāma ({%tasya vīrasya caritam%}
3. 147. 39) to please Hanūmant; Hanūmant
again told Bhīma that no mortal could go
beyond the point where they met since it was
frequented by the gods; Hanūmant informed
Bhīma that he had blocked Bhīma's way les the
should be attacked or cursed by some one, and
that the lake he was searching for was close
by 3. 147. 33-41; Bhīma then told Hanūmant
that he was highly blessed by his meeting with
Hanūmant; Bhīma requested him to show the
[Page082-a+ 40]
unrivalled form which he had assumed when he
leapt over the ocean; only then Bhīma would
believe what Hanūmant had told about him-
self; Hanūmant informed Bhīma that it was
not possible to assume forms of the bygone age;
one acquired the strength, form and prowess
according to the {%yuga%} in which one lived; he
had to follow the (rule of the) {%yuga,%} since no
one could go beyond Time ({%yuge yuge / bala-%}
{%varṣmaprabhāvā hi prahīyanty udbhavanti%}
{%ca … yugaṃ samanuvartāmi kālo hi dura-%}
{%tikramaḥ%} 3. 148. 7, 8); when Bhīma persisted
in his request, Hanūmant increased his body
immensely to look like mountain Maināka
and showed Bhīma the form he had assumed
to cross the ocean 3. 149. 2-4; description
of the body 3. 149. 4-7, 13; Hanūmant
told Bhīma that he could grow even more,
as much as he liked; Bhīma then requested
Hanūmant to assume his former shape 3.
149. 8-12 (Hanumant st. 8) when Bhīma
asked why Rāma himself had to go to Rā-
vaṇa when Hanūmant could destroy Laṅkā,
Hanūmant told him that if he had killed
Rāvaṇa, Rāma's fame would have suffered 3.
149. 14-20; Hanūmant then permitted Bhīma
to depart and showed him the way leading
to the Saugandhikavana and the garden of
Kubera; he warned Bhima not to pluck the
flowers himself and asked him to show regard
for the deities; he asked Bhīma not to act
rashly but follow the {%dharma%} 3. 149. 21-24;
Hanūmant then gave a long discourse on
{%dharma%} to Bhīma (explaining to him {%trayī,%}
{%vārtā%} and {%daṇḍanīti;%} the duties of the four
{%varṇas;%} the conduct of a king) 3. 149. 26-52;
Hanūmant contracted his body and embraced
Bhīma; the embrace removed Bhīma's fatigue;
with faltering voice and tears in his eyes
Hanūmant asked Bhīma to remember him and
[Page082-b+ 40]
not to tell anyone of his whereabouts; having
embraced a mortal (Bhīma) Hanūmant was
happy to be reminded of Rāma; Hanūmant
offered a boon to Bhīma: if Bhīma so wished
Hanūmant could go Hāstinapura and kill the
sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra or crush their town with
a rock 3. 150. 1-9; but Bhīma told Hanū-
mant that he (H.) had already done all that he
could do for Bhīma; instead of a boon he only
asked for Hanūmant's forgiveness and favour;
the Paṇḍavas had found in Hanūmant their
support which would help them to win the war;
hearing that Hanūmant told Bhīma that due to
brotherly feelings and friendliness ({%bhrātṛtvāt%}
{%sauhṛdāc cāpi%} 3. 150. 13), whenever Bhīma
roared in battles, Hanūmant would add his
roar to it and increase its volume; he would
stand on the flag-staff of Arjuna and roar
which would deprive the enemies of their
lives; hence Arjuna's banner often described
as marked by a monkey ({%vānara, kapi,%}
{%śākhāmṛga,%} but the monkey is not named
Hanūmant) 5. 47. 46; 5. 59. 13; 6. 56. 7,
9, 20, 27; 6. 67. 3; 6. 78. 9; 6. 112. 114; 7.
9. 14; 7. 17. 21; 7. 80. 8, 9 (the monkey
terrified the army of the Kauravas); 7. 80.
29; 7. 102. 6; 7. 114. 81; 9. 9. 59; 10. 12.
25; 14. 51. 54; 14. 82. 29; 14. 83. 12, 23.
so saying Hanūmant disappeared 3. 150.
14-15. {@F.@} Meeting with Rāma and the fight
between Vālin and Sugrīva: When Rāma
and Lakṣmaṇa arrived on top of the Ṛśya-
mūka mountain and saw five monkeys,
Hanūmant, as a messenger of Sugrīva,
approached them; Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa first
talked with Hanūmant and then approached
Sugrīva to form friendship with him 3. 264.
9-11; (later, in the fight between Vālin and
Sugrīva) when Rāma could not distinguish
between them, Hanūmant stuck a garland
[Page083-a+ 40]
round the neck of Sugrīva 3. 264. 33.
{@G.@} Search for Sītā: After the search for Sītā,
when Hanūmant and the other monkey-chiefs
were returning to the Ṛśyamūka mountain, on
way they rested in the {%madhuvana;%} Sugrīva
interpreted this behaviour ({%praṇaya%} 3. 266.
28) as indicating that Hanūmant and others
were successful in their mission; the monkey-
chiefs who had gone for the search then
approached Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa and Sugrīva
3. 266. 26-30; looking at the complexion of
Hanūmant and his gait Rāma understood
that he had seen Sītā; Hanūmant informed
Rāma that he had brought the good tidings;
he then described to Rāma his search for
Sītā in the south 3. 266. 31-55 (meeting the
female ascetic Prabhāvatī in the house of the
Daitya Maya; meeting with Saṃpāti and
obtaining from him the information that
Sītā must be with Ṛāvaṇa in Laṅkā and that
Laṅkā lay beyond the ocean); when no one
was prepared to cross the ocean, Hanūmant
did it after entering his father (i. e. Vāyu:
{%tataḥ pitaram āviśya pupluve 'haṃ māhār-%}
{%ṇavam%}) and killing on way an acquatic
Rākṣasī ({%jalarākṣasī%}) 3. 266. 57; in
Laṅkā, Hanūmant saw Sītā in the inner
apartment of Rāvaṇa ({%tatra sītā mayā%}
{%dṛṣṭā rāvaṇāntaḥpure satī%} 3. 266. 58);
having determined her identity Hanūmant
approached her and told her that he was the
son of god Wind and the messenger of Rāma;
he told Sītā that Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were
safe and had enquired after Sītā's well-being;
he assured her that he was a monkey and
not a Rakṣasa, and that Rāma would soon
arrive in Laṅkā with his monkeys; Sītā told
him that she knew him already to be Hanū-
mant as was reported to her by the Rākṣasa
Avindhya; she gave Hanūmant a jewel and
[Page083-b+ 40]
permitted him to leave; to convince Rāma
that Hanūmant had met her, Sītā told him
the incident of Rāma throwing a reed at a
crow on the Citrakūṭa mountain; Hanūmant
then burnt Laṅkā and returned to Rāma
3. 266. 58-68. {@H.@} Encounter with indi-
vidual demons in Rāma's war with Rāvaṇa:
Hanūmant marched at the head of the army
when it started towards the sea in the south
3. 267. 16; when the demon Dhūmrākṣa
attacked the army of the monkeys, Hanū-
mant rushed towards him; this act inspired
confidence in the monkeys; the fight between
the two was fierce like the one between Indra
and Prahlāda; Dhūmrākṣa struck Hanūmant
with maces ({%gadā%}) and clubs ({%parigha%}),
and Hanūmant retaliated with trees; finally
Hanūmant killed Dhūmrākṣa together with
his horses, chariot and charioteer 3. 270. 7,
12-14; when Lakṣmaṇa was engaged in
fighting with the demons Vajravega and
and Pramāthin, Hanūmant attacked Vajra-
vega and killed him with the summit of a
mountain ({%adriśṛṅga%}) 3. 271. 24; Hanūmant
was among the monkey-chiefs who watched
over Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa when they fell
down on the ground tied with the arrows of
Indrajit 3. 273. 4; he was one of those who
applied water, sent by Kubera, to their eyes
which enabled them to see invisible beings 3.
273. 10-13; Hanūmant and other monkey-
chiefs surrounded Rāvaṇa when he rushed at
Rāma 3. 274. 3. {@I.@} Sītā's boon: At the
time of boon-givings after the war Sītā gave
Hanūmant the following boon: “You will
live as long as the fame of Rāma lasts ({%rāma-%}
{%kīrtyā samaṃ putra jīvitaṃ te bhavīṣyati%}),
and that the heavenly enjoyments will wait
on you” 3. 275. 43-44. {@J.@} Messenger to
Bharata: When Rāma approached the city
[Page084-a+ 38]
of Ayodhyā he sent Hanūmant to Bharata as
his messenger to give him the good news
(of Rāma's return); when Hanūmant, came
back, Rāma met Bharata at Nandigrāma 3.
275. 59-60.
