{@Śūla@}¦ m.: A missile ({%astra%} 13. 14. 131,
136), specially related to Śiva (Rudra)
but also to Naṇdi(n), and Viṣṇu (Kṛṣṇa).
{@I.@} Missile of Śiva: Upamanyu saw Śiva
together with his missiles in bodily form
({%mūrtimanti tathāstrāṇi sarvatejomayāni%}
{%ca / mayā dṛṣṭāni govinda bhavasyāmita-%}
{%tejasaḥ%} 13. 14. 121), one of them being
the one which is known as Śūla in the three
worlds 13. 14. 131; hence Śiva (Rudra)
has epithets like {%śūlapāṇi%} 1. 44. 22; 3. 40.

cription: mysterious ({%guhya%}) 13. 14. 131;
indescribable ({%anirdeśya%}) 13. 14. 136; having
very sharp points ({%atitīkṣṇāgra%}); very fright-
ful ({%subhīma%}); causing the opponent's hair
stand on ends ({%lomaharṣaṇa%}), as if threat-
ening him with its eye-brow knit in three
wrinkles ({%triśikhāṃ bhrukuṭīṃ kṛtvā tarja-%}
{%mānam iva sthitam%}) 13. 14. 135; it was like
fire without smoke, black in colour, appearing
like the sun risen at the time of the end of
the universe; it held a serpent in hand, and
hence looking like the god of Death with his
{%pāśa%} in hand ({%vidhūmaṃ sārciṣaṃ kṛṣṇaṃ%}

Strength: If released by Śūlapāṇi (Śiva) it
was capable of tearing open the whole earth,
or dry up the great ocean, or destroy the entire
world 13. 14. 132. {@C.@} Status: It was
equal or even superior to Pāśupata ({%tat-%}
(= Pāśupata) {%tulyādhikam eva vā%}) 13. 14.
131. {@D.@} Use: The demon Lavaṇa,
holding this Śūla in hand, killed the very
strong and universal monarch Māndhātṛ, the
son of Yuvanāśva 13. 14. 133-134. {@E.@}

Part in the epic war: Arjuna told Vyāsa,
after the death of Droṇa, that when on the
battle-field he shot arrows at his enemies he
saw an excellent person ({%puruṣottama%}) of
fiery lustre, looking like the sun, moving in
front of him with his raised burning Śūla; the
person did not touch the ground with his feet
and never released the Śula, but thousands of
Śūlas fell out from it; the direction in which
the excellent person moved, Arjuna's enemies
were destroyed; thus, actually the excellent
person first burnt Arjuna's enemies and Arjuna
burnt them afterwards, but people thought
Arjuna did it; Vyāsa told Arjuna that the
excellent person was none else but Śaṅkara
with his Śūla 7. 173. 3-10. {@II.@} Association
with Nandi(n), one of the attendants of Śiva:
Nandin waited on Śiva holding the burning
Śūla, shining with its lustre ({%pragṛhya%}
{%jvalitam śūlaṃ dīpyamānaṃ svatejasā%}) 12.
274. 15; when Upamanyu saw Śiva, Nandi
stood in front of Śiva having fixed his Śūla
({%śūlaṃ viṣṭabhya tiṣṭhantam%}) and hence
looking like another Śaṅkara 13. 14. 144.
{@III.@} Association with Viṣṇu (Kṛṣṇa):
Viṣṇu, when he on request by Brahman creat-
ed {%daṇḍanīti,%} is described as one having the
excellent Śūla as his weapon ({%śūlavarāyudha%})
12. 122. 26 (commentator Vādirāja, however,
takes it to mean as ‘one who has a weapon
({%cakra%}) which is superior to Śūla ({%śūlād%}
{%varaṃ śreṣṭhaṃ cakram āyudhaṃ yasya,%} see
Cr. edn. 12. 122. 24 f. n.); Viṣṇu is also called
there {%śūla (jaṭā) dhara%} 12. 122. 24; Bhīṣma,
while praising Kṛṣṇa as the highest god, uses
the epithet ‘bearer of Śūla’ ({%śūlabhṛt%}) to
describe him 13. 143. 13.
