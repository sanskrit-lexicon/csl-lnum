50, 54. {@B.@} Origin: The sages once went
to the Kurukṣetra to perform long sessions

Naimiṣeya Kuñja ({%evaṃ sa kuñjo rājendra%}
{%naimiṣeya iti smṛtaḥ%}) 9. 36. 48-51, 54; ({%tataḥ%}

vows and who resort to this {%tīrtha%} become
auspicious and reach the Goloka ({%? gavāṃ%}
{%vimāne%} 13. 105. 44). 13. 105. 45 (for other
