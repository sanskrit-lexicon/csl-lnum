{@Hiraṇyapura<sup>2</sup>@}¦ nt.: Name of the town
of the demons called Kālakeyas (or Kāla-
khañjas) and Paulomas.
{@A.@} History: As told by Mātali to
Arjuna: A Daiteyī named Pulomā and a
Mahāsurī named Kālakā practised severe
austerities for one thousand divine years
of gods; at the end of their austerities they
received a boon by which they secured
less misery for their sons and impossibility
[Page596-b+ 40]
of being killed by gods, demons and ser-
pents: they also received the city Hiraṇya-
pura, made for the Kālakeyas by Brah-
man and occupied by the demons, the
sons of Pulomā and Kālakā ({%agṛhṇītāṃ%}

[Page597-b+ 40]
while returning to the residence of gods
after killing the Nivātakavaca demons,
saw on way the town Hiraṇyapura 3. 170.
1; on hearing from Mātali about the de-
mons occupying the town (3. 170. 8-10),
Arjuna asked Mātali to take him to
Hiraṇyapura so that he might kill the
demons; accordingly Mātali drove him
there quickly in the heavenly chariot 3.
170. 13-15; the battle between Arjuna and
the demons in the town described (3. 170.
16-50); when the demons were being
killed they employed {%māyā%} of the demons
and flew up in the sky together with the
town ({%te vadhyamānā daiteyāḥ puram%}
{%āsthāya tat punaḥ / kham utpetuḥ sanagarā%}
{%māyām āsthāya dānavīm //%}) 3. 170. 21;
Arjuna steadied the town along with the
demons and when broken by his iron
arrows it fell down on the ground 3. 170.
26-27; Mātali praised Arjuna for his feat
of destroying Hiraṇyapura,—a feat which
could not be accomplished even by gods
and Asuras 3. 170. 51-54; when the town
was destroyed and the demons were killed
({%vidhvaste 'tha pure tasmin dānaveṣu%}
{%hateṣu ca%}) the women of the demons
came out of the town weeping aloud
in grief 3. 170. 55-57; Arjuna, after
destroying Hiraṇyapura and killing the
Asuras ({%hiraṇyapuram ārujya nihatya ca%}
{%mahāsurān%}), returned to Indra with Mātali
3. 170. 60-61; hearing from Mātali in
details the exploits of Arjuna, ({%hiraṇya-%}
{%puraghātaṃ ca māyānāṃ ca nivāraṇam%}),
Indra exclaimed ‘well done’ 3. 170. 63-64;
this exploit of Arjuna is referred to: (i)
by Bhīṣma, when he referred to the boon
granted by Nara and Nārāyaṇa to Indra,
while addressing Duryodhana ({%tābhyāṃ ca%}

{%lomān kālakhañjāṃś ca%}) 5. 48. 13-14 (in
the earlier account in 3. 170 Indra is not
mentioned as taking part in the battle);
(ii) again by Bhīṣma while reminding
Duryodhana about the exploits of Arjuna
({%dānavānāṃ sahasrāṇi hiraṇyapuravāsinām /%}
{%hatāny ekarathenājau%}) 5. 166. 34 (this
could also be a reference to Nivātakavacas
of Hiraṇyapura<sup>1</sup>); (iii) by Arjuna while
telling Uttara his earlier exploits ({%aham%}
{%indrasya vacanāt saṃgrāme 'bhyahanaṃ%}
{%purā / paulomān kālakhañjāṃś ca%}) 4. 56.
9 (actually, according to the account in
3. 170, Indra had not asked Arjuna to kill
Paulomas and Kālakhañjas (there called
Kālakeyas); Arjuna did this on his own;
[Page598-b+ 18]
Indra had asked him to destroy the Nivāta-
kavacas of Hiraṇyapura<sup>1</sup> (3. 165. 10-11)
which is mentioned by Arjuna in 4. 56. 11);
(iv) by Yudhiṣṭhira when, while lamenting
over the death of Abhimanyu, he referred
to the feats of Arjuna ({%hiraṇyapuravāsinaḥ%}
{% … paulomāḥ sagaṇā hatāḥ%}) 7. 49. 17; (v)
possibly by Duryodhana while reminding
Droṇa of Arjuna's exploits ({%dānavānāṃ%}
{%sahasrāṇi hiraṇyapuravāsinām / vijigye%}
{%puruṣavyāghraḥ%}) 7. 160. 19. {@E.@} Simile:
When the demons were killed the town
Hiraṇyapura became unfit to be seen like a
pond with its elephants killed or like a forest
the trees of which had gone dry ({%hatanāgam%}
