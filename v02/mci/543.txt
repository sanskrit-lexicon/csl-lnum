{@Mahāvyūha@}¦ m.: Name of a particular
way of arranging the army ({%vyūha%}).
<div n="P">Described as extremely invincible
({%sudurjaya%}) 6. 95. 38; (1) Bhīṣma, Droṇa
and Duryodhana arranged on the second
day of the war the Kaurava army according
[Page127-b+ 40]
to Mahāvyūha to counter the Krauñca
vyūha of the Pāṇḍavas 6. 47. 1, 10;
6. 48. 10; in this arrangement Bhīṣma, sur-
rounded by a large army, was in the front;
he was followed by Droṇa, accompanied
by the Kuntalas, Daśārṇas, Māgadhas and
many others; Śakuni with his army, as
also the Gāndhāras, Sindhusauvīras, the
Śibis, and the Vasātis, moved with Droṇa to
protect him; Duryodhana, with his brothers,
and the Aśvātakas, the Vikarṇas, the Śar-
milas and the Kośalas, and many others took
positions to offer protection to the army of
Śakuni; Bhūriśravas, Śala, Śalya, Bhaga-
datta, Vinda and Anuvinda of the Avanti,
stood on the left side of the vyūha ({%vāma-%}
{%pārśva%}); Saumadatti (Bhūriśravas) Suśar-
man, Sudakṣiṇa of the Kāmboja country,
Śatāyu and Śrutāyu took care of the right side
({%dakṣiṇa pārśva%}); Aśvatthāman, Kṛpa, and
Kṛtavarman with a large army guarded the
rear ({%senāpṛṣṭhe vyavasthitāḥ%}); kings of
many countries, Ketumant, Vasudāna, and
the son of the Kāśī king acted as the rear-
guards of the army ({%pṛṣṭhagopāḥ%}) 6. 47.
11-20; (2) Apparently the Kaliṅga king,
when asked by Duryodhana to protect Droṇa
and attack Bhīma (6. 49. 37, 38; 6. 50. 1,
3 ff.), had arranged his army in the Mahā-
vyūha way ({%mahāvyūhaḥ kaliṅgānām%} 6. 50.
113); in that vyūha many elephants, horse-
men, and chariot fighters took part ({%nāgā-%}
{%śvarathasaṃkulaḥ%}); Bhīma, by himself,
was able to crush it 6. 50. 113; (3) Bhīṣma
arranged the Kaurava army according to the
Mahāvyūha on the eighth day of the war 6.
83. 5, 13, 15; it looked like an ocean ({%sāgara-%}
{%pratima%}) 6. 83. 5, ({%sāgaropama%}) 6. 83. 16;
the vyūha was led by Bhīṣma, accompanied
by the Mālavas, Dākṣiṇātyas, and the Āvan-
[Page128-a+ 40]
tyas; he was followed by Droṇa, accompa-
nied by Pulindas, Pāradas, Kṣudrakas, and
the Mālavas; Droṇa was followed by Bhaga-
datta, accompanied by the Māgadhas, the
Kaliṅgas, and the Piśācas; behind him was
Bṛhadbala of the Kosala country, accompa-
nied by the Mekalas, the Traipuras, and the
Cicchilas; then came Trigarta (Suśarman),
the ruler of Prasthalas accompanied by many
Kāṃbojas and the Yavanas in thousands;
Aśvatthāman followed Trigarta; behind
Aśvatthāman marched Duryodhana surround-
ed by his brothers; Kṛpa followed Duryo-
dhana 6. 83. 6-13; (4) The Pāṇḍavas
arranged their army in the Mahāvyūha way
(6. 95. 38) on the ninth day of the war
to counter the Sarvatobhadravyūha of the
Kauravas (6. 95. 26); in the forefront of
this vyūha stood Bhīmasena (6. 95. 40),
along with Yudhiṣṭhira, Nakula and Saha-
deva; Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Virāṭa and Sātyaki
apparently followed them; they seem to have
been followed by Śikhaṇḍin, Vijaya (Arjuna),
the Rākṣasa Ghaṭotkaca, Cekitāna and Kunti-
bhoja, all of them encircled by large armies;
the rear seems to have been made up by
Abhimanyu, Drupada, and five Kekaya
brothers (6. 95. 34-38); (but Arjuna had
advised Dhṛṣṭadyumna to see that Śikhaṇḍin
confronted Bhīṣma and that he would pro-
tect Śikhaṇḍin ({%śikhaṇḍinaṃ naravyāghra%}
{%bhīṣmasya pramukhe 'nagha / sthāpaya-%}
{%svādya pāñcālya tasya goptāham apy uta%}
6. 95. 25; according to Duryodhana's infor-
mation, in that position Yudhāmanyu would
guard the left wheel of Arjuna and Utta-
maujas the right wheel 6. 95. 21).
