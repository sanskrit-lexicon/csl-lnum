‘no one should enter into the donce's house, should graze one's
cattle on the green crops in his fields, should harvest the ripe
crops in his fields, should crush his sugar-cane, should accept
{%rocikā%} and {%ciṭolā%} from him, should take stools, seats and cots
from him and should take wood, fuel, grass, chaff, etc., from
him’. For {%gṛh-āvataraṇa,%} see {%umbara-bheda.%} Words like {%rocikā,%}
{%ciṭolā,%} etc., are not intelligible, although they certainly refer
to certain obligations or levies. Cf. {%Ind. Ep.,%} p. 394.
