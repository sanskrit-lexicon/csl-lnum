{%bhāga-bhoga-kara%}¦ (HRS), taken by some as a single levy
and explained as the king's grain-share, identical with {%bhāga%}
of the {%Arthaśāstra%} and {%bali%} of the Smṛtis, though distinguished
from {%dhānya%} in a Maitraka record, where it has been supposed
to mean a fixed contribution in kind as distinguished from
the contribution consisting of a share of the produce. If
{%bhāgabhogakara%} was a single levy (and did not indicate
{%bhāga, bhoga%} and {%kara%}), it may have really been a tax collected
in lieu of {%bhāga%} (grain share) and {%bhoga%} (periodical offerings).
