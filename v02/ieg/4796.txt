{%Rajjuka%}¦ (IE 8-3; HD), Prakrit {%Rajuka%} or {%Lajūka%} (EI 2);
an officer of the land survey and revenue department, accord-
ing to some; but seems to be the governor of a district, one of
whose functions was probably the survey of land with a measur-
ing rope for the fixation of the amount of the king's share of
the produce; probably the same as Greek {%Agronomoi%} mentioned
by Megasthenes.
