{%pagoda,%}¦ also called ‘star {%pagoda%}’; Anglicised form of the name
of the gold coin called {%gadyāṇa, hūn (hon)%} or {%varāha;%} since the
word {%pagoda%} also meant ‘a temple’, the coin seems to have been
so named owing to the representation of a temple or a deity on
it; {%pagoda%} may be a corruption of {%bhagavatī%} meaning ‘the mother-
goddess’.
