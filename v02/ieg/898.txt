{%Bhaṭa%}¦ (IE 8-3; CII 3, 4; EI 30; HD), same as {%Bhaṭa-%}
{%manuṣya;%} probably derived from {%bhṛta%} which is sometimes used
in its place. Generally used along with {%cāṭa%} or {%chātra;%} literally,
‘a soldier’; but really a {%Pāik, Barkandāz%} or {%Piāda,%} i. e. a constable.
It is spelt as {%bhaṭṭa%} in the medieval inscriptions of Eastern
India, though rarely the two are distinguished. See {%Bhaṭṭa.%}
<div n="P">({%SITI%}), a personal servant or soldier.
