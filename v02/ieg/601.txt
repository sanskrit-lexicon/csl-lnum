{%aśvamedha%}¦ (CII 3, 4), a sacrificial ceremony centering
in a horse, generally performed by independent monarchs.
Kings celebrating the sacrifice sometimes assumed suitable
titles (cf. {%Aśvamedha-parākrama%} and {%Aśvamedha-Mahendra%} claimed
respectively by Samudragupta and Kumāragupta I on their
coins). Some kings performed two, four or more horse-sacri-
fices. For a list of the performers of {%aśvamedha%} known form
