{%bhūmicchidra-nyāya%}¦ (IE 8-5; EI 30; CII 3, 4; HRS),
literally, ‘the maxim of the fallow land’; the principle of the
rent-free enjoyment of land by one who brings it under cultiva-
tion for the first time. See {%Ep. Ind.,%} Vol XXIX, p. 86. The
maxim is based on the old custom of allowing a person, who
first brings a plot of fallow or jungle land under cultivation
for the first time, to enjoy it without paying rent. {%Bhūmi-%}
{%cchidra%} gradually came to mean ‘uncultivable land’. See
{%bhūmicchidrapidhāna-nyāya, avanirandhra-nyāya.%}
