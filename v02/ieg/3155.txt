SITI; CITD), according to the lexicons, a sovereign ruler
[Page-180+ 40]
who is the lord of 40 {%yojanas%} of land and a lakh of villages; but,

vince; title of a feudatory ruler or governor (see {%Bomb. Gaz.,%}
Vol. XXI, p. 354); see {%Maṇḍaleśvara%} essentially meaning ‘the
ruler of a {%maṇḍala%} or district’; also called {%Mahāmaṇḍalika,%} etc.,
cf. {%Mahāmaṇḍaleśvar-ādhipati.%} The status of a {%Mahāmaṇdal-%}
{%eśvara%} seems to have been superior to that of a {%Maṇḍaleśvara,%}
while {%Mahāmaṇḍaleśvarādhipati%} apparently enjoyed a still higher
rank.
