{%Brahma-kṣatra, Brahma-kṣatriya%}¦ (EI 5, 12, 24), a Kṣatriya
family claiming descent from a Brāhmaṇa parent; a family in
which the blood of the Brāhmaṇas and Kṣatriyas has been
mixed. See {%Vishveshvaranand Ind. Journ.,%} Vol. I, pp. 87 ff., etc.
In one record ({%Journ. Karnatak Univ.,%} Vol. II, No 2, January
1959, p. 47), the Nāgavaṃśa, to which a Kadamba king's
minister Māyideva belonged, is called {%Brahma-kṣatra%} because it
originated from the intercourse of its progenitor Nāgarāja with
a Brāhmaṇa girl. {%Brahma-vaiśya%} should be likewise explained.
