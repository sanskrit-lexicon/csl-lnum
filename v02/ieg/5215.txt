{%saṅgam,%}¦ Tamil; same as Sanskrit {%saṅgha;%} an assembly of
ancient Tamil poets; the name given to an assembly of poets
reported in tradition to have functioned in three different pe-
riods. The poets are believed to have been both literary critics
and composers. Literary compositions of the age were later
collected and compiled into anthologies known as {%Eṭṭuttokai,%}
{%Pattuppāṭṭu%} and {%Padineṇkīḻkaṇakku%} according to their contents
and size. The {%saṅgam%} is stated to have flourished at Kūḍal
(also called Madurai in later literature) in the first and last
period and at Kavāṭapuram in the middle period. The latest
limit for the first two anthologies may be placed round about
700 A.D. See M. S. Purnalingam Pillai, {%Tamil Literature,%}
