{%Tantrin%}¦ (SITI; ASLV), a soldier; a trooper; a leader
of the army; a temple priest; a weaver. It has been sup-
posed that the Tamil words {%Kaikkoḻar%} and {%Aṭavi%} came to signify
both a soldier and a weaver on the analogy of the word {%Tantrin%}
used in both the senses. Cf. {%Tantrimār,%} members of the army
corps; a class of persons who perform worship in temples; a priest.
