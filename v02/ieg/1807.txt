{%eḍūka,%}¦ cf. {%eḍuo%} (CII 2-1), supposed to be ‘a wall into which
bones (meaning planks and other hard substances) have been
inserted in order to strengthen the structure’, because it is
explained in a commentary as {%asthy-aṅkita kuḍya;%} but {%asthy-%}
{%aṅkita-kuḍya%} seems to mean a Buddhist {%stūpa%} raised on cor-
poreal relics which were an object of worship. Although
the word {%kuḍya%} is reckoned in the lexicons in the sense of a wall,
it seems to mean ‘a mound’ in this case. The word {%aidūka%}
derived from {%eḍūka%} is used in Buddhist Sanskrit in the
sense of a Buddhist {%stūpa.%} See {%IHQ,%} Vol. XXIX, pp.
302-03.
