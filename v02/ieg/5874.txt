{%tala-vāṭaka%}¦ (EI 31), same as {%tala-pāṭaka%} or {%tala-vṛtti.%} But
cf. {%tala-vāṭaka%} in {%tala-vāṭaka-vāstunā saha kṣetram,%} ‘a piece of
land together with suburbs, gardens and homestead land’
({%Select Inscriptions,%} p. 349, text line 18). The meaning here
may also be ‘adjoining land’ which was probably the original
implication of the expression.
