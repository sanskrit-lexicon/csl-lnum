{%Antaraṅga%}¦ (IE 8-3; BL), explained as ‘a privy councillor
or a physician’, though the same person is known to be called
{%Rāja-vaidya%} (i. e. the royal physician) and {%Antaraṅga;%} probably
a private secretary; but mentioned along with {%Vaiśvāsika%}
(EI 3); regarded by some as a class of royal servants very
intimate with the king, probably the same as {%Ābhyantara%} (HD).
Cf. {%Ep. Ind.,%} Vol. XI, p. 286; Vol. XII, p. 99.
