{%kumāra-gadyāṇa%}¦ (IE 8-5; EI 4; HRS), probably, a tax
of one {%gadyāṇa%} (i. e. the coin of that name) payable on the
occasion of a prince's birth. See {%kumāra-gadiāṇaka, komarina-%}
{%gadyāṇa,%} etc. Cf. Tamil {%kumara-kaccāṇam%} (EI 21), supposed to
be a tax payable in coin for the maintenance of the temple of
Kumāra or Subrahmaṇya (SITI). But {%kumāra-gadyāṇa%} is found in
the records of the Gāhaḍavālas of Vārāṇasī, in whose dominions
the god in question was not as popular as in the South.
