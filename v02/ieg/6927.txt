{%bhūmi-cchidra-nāyena%}¦ or {%°cchidra-pidhāna-vyāyena,%} ‘in accor-
dance with the principle of cultivating the land for the first
time and enjoying it free of taxes as a result’. The word {%chidra%}
in the first means ‘cultivation’ and {%chidra-pidhāna%} in the second
‘reclamation of uncultivable land for the first time.’ Some-
times {%vidhāna%} is wrongly used for {%pidhāna.%} See {%Ind. Ep.,%} pp. 397-98.
