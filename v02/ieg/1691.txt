{%ditya%}¦ (EI 9, 12, 28; CII 4; HRS), known from Maitraka
records; name of a tax, according to some; probably, the
same as {%datti,%} i. e. a gift or occasional present to be offered
to the landlord; cf. {%sarva-ditya-viṣṭi-prātibhedikā-parihīna%} or
{%°parihṛta%} ({%Ep. Ind.,%} Vol. VI, p. 298, text line 20); also cf.
{%sa-ditya-dāna-karaṇa%} ({%Ep. Ind.,%} Vol. XXXI, p. 301, text line 14),
an epithet of the gift land. {%Ditya%} is probably derived from
Prakrit {%dijja%} = Sanskrit {%deya,%} ‘to be given’, ‘an object that has
been given away’ in the sense of ‘customary presents’. For
{%ditta,%} cf. {%Bhār. Vid.,%} Vol. XVII, Nos. 3-4 pp. 125-26. See
