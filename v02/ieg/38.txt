{%abhyantara-siddhi, abhyantara-siddhika%}¦ (IE 8-5; EI 20, 22),
same as {%ābhyantara-siddhi;%} internal income or revenue, or taxes
payable to the village authorities as against those payable to the
king; cf. {%tribhog-ābhyantara-siddhi, bāhy-ābhyantara-siddhi, bāhy-%}
{%ābhyantar-ādāya;%} also {%sarv-ābhyantara-siddhi%} (EI 20), and {%antaḥ-%}
{%siddhika%} (CII 4), a privilege of the donee of rent-free land.
According to some (CII 4), it refers to the privilege of the
donee offering full power of adjudication in law-suits.
But expressions like {%tribhog-ābhyantara-siddhi%} (q. v.) render it
doubtful. See {%bāhya, siddhi, siddh-āya.%}
