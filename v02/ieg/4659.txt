of the lunar months in Northern India, according to which
the months end with the full-moon day, and the dark fortnights
precede the bright; Fleet states that in astronomical works, it
is always the {%amānta%} arrangement that is actually taken for

arrangement was used with the Śaka years, for the civil reckoning,
up to between 804 and 866 A. D.; on the other hand, according
to him, even in Northern India, it was not used with the Newar
