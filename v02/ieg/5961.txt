{%Ṭhakkura%}¦ (IE 8-3; EI 23, 30; CII 4; HD), supposed
to be a title derived from a Turkish word ({%Tegin%}); occurs as a
title in the {%Rājataraṅgiṇī,%} VII. 290, 706, 738; probably, a
fief-holder; sometimes mentioned in the list of subordinates;
generally used as a title of particular persons indicating their
rank or office. The significance of the word possibly varied
in different localities and ages. Its foreign origin is sup-
ported by its unpopularity in the South. Cf. {%Ep. Ind.,%} Vol.
XIII, p. 297; Vol. XIX, p. 243.
