{%gaurī-varāṭikā,%}¦ ‘virgin-money’. {%Gaurī%} means ‘a virgin’
and {%varāṭikā%} is used primarily in the sense of {%varāṭa%} or {%varāṭaka,%}
‘a cowrie-shell’, and secondarily in that of ‘money’. In the
records of Mithilā, {%gaurī-varāṭikā%} means ‘money to be paid
to the master of a slave girl of marriageable age by the master
of her bridegroom’. See {%JNSI,%} Vol. XVI, pp. 264 ff.
