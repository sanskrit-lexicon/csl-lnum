{%sarva-mānya%}¦ (IE 8-5, SITI; CITD), a free tenure; a
rent-free holding; land exempted from taxes; lands and villages
fully exempt from all taxes. This corresponds to the
{%iṟaiyili%} class of land mentioned in the Col13a inscriptions. Often
this is associated with {%aṣṭa-bhoga,%} i. e. the eight forms of enjoy-
ing the land. For a discussion of this form of land tenure, see
{%JAHRS,%} Vol. X, pp. 123-32. It is noteworthy that even the
so-called tax-free ({%i%}ṟ{%aiyili%}) lands paid to the king certain dues
of the nature of taxes. See K. A. Nilakanta Sastri, {%The%}
{%Co%}l13{%as,%} 2nd ed., pp. 534-35. See {%sarva-namasya,%} etc.
