{%bali%}¦ (IE 8-5; HRS), voluntary gift (afterwards, com-
pulsory contribution) and tribute from the subjects as indicated
by Vedic literature; later, tax in general as suggested by the
standard lexicons; king's grain share, identical with {%bhāga%}
but different from {%kara%} according to the {%Arthaśāstra,%} but not
the Junagadh inscription of Rudradāman (cf. {%bali-śulka-%}
{%bhāga%} in line 14). The Rummindei inscription of Aśoka also
distinguishes between {%bali%} and {%bhāga%} and seems to identify
{%bali%} with {%kara%} (or with pilgrims' tax). See {%Select Inscriptions,%}
pp. 71, 173.
