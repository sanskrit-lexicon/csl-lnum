{%pagod, pagoda%}¦ (EI 8-8), also called ‘star pagoda’; English
name of the gold coin called {%hūn (hon)%} or {%varāha;%} probably so
called because the coins often bore the representation of a
temple called {%pagod%} or {%pagoda%} by the early European travellers.
The word seems to have been derived from Sanskrit {%bhagavat%} or
{%bhagavatī%} meaning the deities worshipped in the temples and
also often figuring on the coins. Cf. ‘{%ṭaṅkakas%} stamped with the
figure of the {%Bhagavat%}’ (Bhandarkar's List, No. 2033).
<div n="P">{%Cf. Cīna-pagoda%} (SII 12), ‘the Chinese temple’; name of
a Buddhist shrine at Nāgapaṭṭanam.
