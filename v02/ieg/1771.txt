{%Dūtaka%}¦ (IE 8-3; HD), messenger; conveyor of a request
or message; cf. the Khalimpur plate of Dharmapāla ({%Ep.%}
{%Ind.,%} Vol. IV, p. 250), according to which the king was reques-
ted to make a grant by a {%Mahāsāmantādhipati%} through prince
[Page-104+ 40]
Tribhuvanapāla as the {%Dūtaka.%} His function is called {%dūtya%}
in the Nalanda plate of Devapāla ({%Ep. Ind.,%} Vol. XVII,

<div n="P">({%IE%} 8-3; EI 23, 30; CII 3, 4), according to some, the
technical title of an officer connected with royal charters,
whose duty it was to carry the king's orders to the local officials
by whom the charter was then drawn up and delivered. But
the {%Dūtaka%} seems to have been responsible for putting the
document and also perhaps the gift land in the donee's possession.
There are instances of more {%Dūtakas%} than one (IA 19). See
also {%Ājñā, Dūta,%} and {%sva-mukh-ājñā.%} Cf. {%Ind. Ep.,%} pp. 143-44.
