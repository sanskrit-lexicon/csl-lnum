{%saṃvat%}¦ (IE 8-1), originally an abbreviation of {%saṃvatsara%}
(a year) or any of its declensional cases that can be used in ex-
pressing a date; later stereotyped in the sense of ‘a year’ or
‘an era’. It was generally regarded as indeclinable; but we
have some cases of the use of forms with case-endings, e. g.,
{%saṃvataḥ, saṃvatā, saṃvati%} and {%saṃvatām.%} See also {%saṃvate%} (IE
8-1), the seventh case-ending of {%saṃvata,%} a corrupt form of
{%saṃvat.%} Since the late medieval age, the word specially indi-
cates the Vikrama era, although originally it was used with the
name of any reckoning in quoting the dates of records, especially
the regnal reckoning. The word is used in inscriptions in a
large number of corrupt forms, e. g., {%samvata, samvatta, samata,%}
{%samanta, samatta, saṃmat, samasta, smat, samvatu, samvatū,%} etc., etc.
