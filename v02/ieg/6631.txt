{%vinirgata%}¦ (EI 7), cf. {%Pāṭaliputra-bhaṭṭāgrahāra-vinirgata%}
({%Ep. Ind.,%} Vol. XXXII, p. 122, text line 16); ‘hailing from’,
or more suitably ‘one whose family hails from’. When a
[Page-375+ 39]
locality called Aṭṭamūla is described as {%vinirgata%} from Bṛhad-
dhaṭṭa, it seems to mean that the former was originally a part
of the latter ({%ibid.,%} Vol. XXXIII, p. 151).
