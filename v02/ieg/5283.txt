{%Śarabhaṅga%}¦ (IE 8-3; 8-8; EI 23), a leader of forces; an
officer of the military department; possibly, a military governor;
same as Persian {%Sarhang%} and Hindī {%Serāṅg;%} also spelt {%Sarabhaṅga%}

the headman of a native crew, whether on board a ship or a
boat; also to the headman of a gang of natives attached to artill-

etc.’ Cf. Vogel, {%Ant. Ch. St.,%} pp. 123, 166 (spelt {%Sarobhaṅga%}),
{%Ind. Cult.,%} Vol. VII, p. 309. Kane ({%Hist. Dharm.,%} Vol. III,
p. 1005) is certainly wrong when he thinks that it may be con-

upon a very learned man who faced the ordeal of answering
satisfactorily all questions on any {%śāstra%} put to him by learned
{%Ācāryas%} and also the questions put by common people). See {%Ep.%}
