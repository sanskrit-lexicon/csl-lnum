{%aṣṭabhoga-tejaḥsvāmya%}¦ (IA 8), unbridled ownership
endowed with all the rights associated with the enjoyment of
property; translated as ‘with the eight rights of full possession’
though {%aṣṭa%} probably means ‘all’ and not merely ‘eight’ (cf.
{%aṣṭādaśa,%} etc.); cf. {%aṣṭabhoga-tejaḥsvāmyaṃ ca krayeṇ = ādāya%} (EI
23), ‘having secured the {%aṣṭabhoga-tejaḥsvāmya%} rights by pur-
chase’; (IA 19), translated as ‘the proprietorship of all the
glory of the {%aṣṭa-bhoga%}’, and {%aṣṭa-bhoga%} explained as ‘the
deposits of buried treasure ({%nidhi-nikṣepa%}), water, stones, the
{%akṣīṇī,%} that which may accrue, that which has been made
property, that which may be made property, and augmen-
tation’. But there is probably no justification for taking
{%nidhi-nikṣepa%} as a single unit.
<div n="P">{%Cf. aṣṭabhoga-tejassvāmya-daṇḍaśulka-yukta%} ({%Ind. Ant.,%}
Vol. XIX, p. 247, text line 102), mentioned along with {%nidhi-%}
{%nikṣepa-pāṣāṇ-ārām-ādi-catuṣ-prakāra-bīravaṇa-pārikh-āya-sahita.%} The
separate mention of these two groups shows that {%aṣṭa-bhoga%}
vaguely indicated all kinds of proprietary rights.
