{%Cāṭa%}¦ (HD), irregular soldiers according to Fleet and
Bühler. Vogel ({%Ant. Ch. St.,%} pp. 130-32) points out that
Chamba is the only place where the ancient word {%Cāṭa%} is still
extant in the modern form {%Cā%}ḏ meaning ‘the head of a Parganā’.
An important privilege of a gift village was ‘not to be entered
by {%Cāṭas%} and {%Bhaṭas%}’. Inscriptions ({%Ep. Ind.,%} Vol. XI,
p. 221) often specify that the granted land was not to be entered
by {%Cāṭas%} and {%Bhaṭas%} except for seizing robbers and those guilty
of harm or treason to the king (cf. {%a-cāṭa-bhaṭa-praveśyaṃ cora-%}
{%drohaka-varjam%} in op. cit., Vol. VIII, p. 287). Sometimes we
have {%bhaṭa-cāṭa-sevak-ādīn%} ({%Ep. Ind.,%} Vol. IV, p. 211) and
{%caṭṭa-bhaṭṭa-jātīyān janapadān%} (ibid., Vol. XIV, p. 160).

<div n="P">({%IE%} 8-3; CII 3, 4), generally mentioned along with
{%bhaṭa;%} sometimes replaced by {%cāra%} (spy) and {%chātra%} (literally,
‘umbrella-bearer’, but really, a constable, i. e. a {%Pāik%} or {%Piāda%});
probably indicates the leader of a group of {%Bhaṭas,%} i. e. {%Pāiks%}
and {%Piādas;%} a policeman leading a group of {%Pāiks.%} See {%caṭṭa.%}
Yājñavalkya, I. 336, speaks of the duty of the king to
protect people from the harassment caused by {%cāṭas,%} robbers
and {%Kāyasthas%} and the {%Mitākṣarā%} explains {%cāṭa%} as persons
who deprive people of their wealth after creating false confi-
dence in them. According to Bṛhaspati quoted by Aparārka,
‘dangers common to all are those arising from the {%cāṭas%} and
thieves’. The word {%cāṭa%} in the passage {%tārkika-cāṭa-bhaṭa-rāj-%}
{%āpraveśya%} in Śaṅkara's {%Bhāsya%} on the {%Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad%}
is explained by Ānandagiri by saying that the {%cāṭas%} are those
that transgress the rules of conduct for decent people and that
{%bhaṭas%} are servants telling falsehood ({%Ep. Ind.,%} Vol. IX, p. 296).
But {%cāṭa%} is used in inscriptions in the sense of a royal official.
