{%aṅga-bhoga%}¦ (EI 17; CITD), often associated with {%raṅga-%}
{%bhoga%} as {%aṅga-raṅga-bhoga,%} usually explained as ‘decora-
tions and illuminations of a deity’. That {%aṅga-bhoga%} means
decoration of the image of a deity is clear from the fact
that a queen is known to have received a village as an {%agrahāra%}
for her {%aṅga-bhoga,%} i. e. as her pin-money ({%Bomb. Gaz.,%} Vol. I,
Part ii, p. 448). Sometimes the land granted for the {%aṅga-%}
{%bhoga%} of a deity came to be known as the deity's {%aṅga-bhoga%}
({%Ep. Ind.,%} Vol. XXXIII, p. 182); cf. {%aṅga,%} same as {%gātra%}
(IA 11).
