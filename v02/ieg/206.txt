{%Ājñā%}¦ (IE 8-3; EI 27; BL; CII 3), an order or command;
same as {%ājñapti%} or {%ājñāpti%} supposed to be connected
with giving the order for the drawing up of a charter; person
receiving a king's order regarding the preparation of a charter;
usually translated as ‘executor of a grant’; standing alone,
the word is supposed to indicate the office of the {%Dūtaka,%}
though the latter seems to have been additionally responsible
for giving the donee the possession of the gift land. Cf. {%Ep. Ind.,%}
Vol. XIV, p. 362 (of the Gaṅga year 149) where the words are
{%ājñā mahāmahattara-Śivarmā;%} also {%svayam = ājñā%} ({%CII,%} Vol.
III, p. 115; {%Ep. Ind.,%} Vol. XVI, p. 19) taken to mean that
the king employed no {%Dūtaka%} to convey the details of his grant
to the local officers, but that he gave the details in person.
[Page-013+ 40]
The expression {%sva-mukh-ājñā%} (literally, the oral order of the
king) is also explained in the same way. The suggestion that
{%Ājñādāpaka%} sometimes occurs as a synonym of {%Dūtaka%} is wrong.
See {%Ājñapti, Ājñā-sañcārin,%} etc. Cf. {%Ind. Ep.,%} pp. 143-44.
