<F>(*) Wils. ad hanc vocem: „{%The actual or emblematic sacrifice
of a horse. This sacrifice is one of the highest order,
and performed a hundred times, entitles the sacrificer
to the domination of Swerga or paradise: it appears to
have been originally typical; the horse and other animals
being simply bound during the performation of certain ceremonies;
the actual sacrifice is an introduction of a later
period. See AS. R. Vol. 8, 442. Colebrooke, on the Védas%}.”</F>
