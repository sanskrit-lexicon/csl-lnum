{@Manyā@}¦ (plur.), ‘nape of the neck,’ occurs in a passage of the
Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> directed against a disease which Bloomfield<sup>2</sup>

a combination of the words {%manyā%} and {%skandhyā,%} ‘pains of the
neck and shoulders,’ both occurring in verses 1 and 3 of the
Atharvan hymn), mentioned by Wise.<sup>3</sup>
