{@Pra-pitva@}¦ is found in several passages of the Rigveda as a
designation of time. In one passage<sup>1</sup> the sense is made clear
by the context: ‘at the rising of the sun’ ({%sūra udite%}), ‘at mid-
day’ ({%madhyaṃdine divaḥ%}), and ‘at the Prapitva, bordering on
the night’ ({%apiśarvare%}). In another passage<sup>2</sup> the sense of ‘late
in the day’ also seems adequate, while the phrase<sup>3</sup> {%abhipitve%}
{%ahnaḥ,%} ‘at the close of day,’ also denotes the evening. According
to Geldner,<sup>4</sup> the sense of the word is the ‘decisive moment’ in
a race or a battle, and so the ‘end of the day.’<sup>5</sup> {%Cf.%} {@Ahan.@}
