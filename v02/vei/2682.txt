{@Rājya@}¦ in the Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> and later<sup>2</sup> regularly denotes
‘sovereign power,’ from which, as the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup>
notes, the Brahmin is excluded.
<div n="P"/>In addition to Rājya, the texts give other expressions of
sovereign power. Thus the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> contends
[Page2-221+ 43]
that the Rājasūya sacrifice is that of a king, the {@Vājapeya@} that
of a Samrāj or emperor, the status of the latter (Sāmrājya)
being superior to that of the former (Rājya). The sitting on a
throne ({@Āsandī@}) is given in the same text<sup>5</sup> as one of the
characteristics of the Samrāj. Elsewhere<sup>6</sup> Svārājya, ‘uncon-
trolled dominion,’ is opposed to Rājya. In the ritual of the
{@Rājasūya@} the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>7</sup> gives a whole series of
terms: Rājya, Sāmrājya, Bhaujya, Svārājya, Vairājya, Pāra-
meṣṭhya, and Māhārājya, while Ādhipatya, ‘supreme power,’ is
found elsewhere.<sup>8</sup> But there is no reason to believe that these
terms refer to essentially different forms of authority. A king
might be called a {@Mahārāja@} or a {@Samrāj,@} without really being
an overlord of kings; he would be so termed if he were an
important sovereign, or by his own entourage out of compli-
ment, as was {@Janaka@} of {@Videha.@}<sup>9</sup> That a really great monarchy
of the Aśoka or Gupta type ever existed in the Vedic period
seems highly improbable.<sup>10</sup>
