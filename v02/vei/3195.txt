{@Śaryāta@}¦ is mentioned once in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as a protégé of
the Aśvins. Of him in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa^2 and the
[Page2-365+ 43]
Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> is told a story how {@Cyavana@} was annoyed
by the {@Śāryātas,@} and appeased by the gift of {@Sukanyā,@}
Śaryāta's daughter, as a wife, and how Cyavana was then
restored to youth by the Aśvins. He is there called {@Mānava@}

a sacrificer, in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa.<sup>4</sup>
