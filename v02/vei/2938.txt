{@Vidatha@}¦ is a word of obscure sense, confined mainly to the
Rigveda. According to Roth,<sup>1</sup> the sense is primarily ‘order,’
then the concrete body which gives orders, then ‘assembly’ for
secular<sup>2</sup> or religious ends,<sup>3</sup> or for war.<sup>4</sup> Oldenberg<sup>5</sup> once
thought that the main idea is ‘ordinance’ (from {%vi-dhā,%}
‘dispose,’ ‘ordain’), and thence ‘sacrifice.’ Ludwig<sup>6</sup> thinks
that the root idea is an ‘assembly,’ especially of the {@Maghavans@}
and the Brahmins. Geldner<sup>7</sup> considers that the word pri-
marily means ‘knowledge,’ ‘wisdom,’ ‘priestly lore,’ then
‘sacrifice’ and ‘spiritual authority.’ Bloomfield,<sup>8</sup> on the other
hand, insists that Vidatha refers to the ‘house’<sup>9</sup> in the first
place (from {%vid,%} ‘acquire’), and then to the ‘sacrifice,’ as
connected with the house; this interpretation, at any rate,
appears to suit all the passages. The term {%vidathya,%} once<sup>10</sup>
applied to the king ({%samrāṭ%}), might seem to be against this
view, but it may refer to his being ‘rich in homesteads’; and
the connexion of the woman with the Vidatha, as opposed to
[Page2-297+ 43]
the {@Sabhā,@} tells in favour<sup>11</sup> of Bloomfield's explanation. That
the word ever denotes an asylum, like the house of the
Brahmin,<sup>12</sup> as Ludwig<sup>13</sup> suggests, is doubtful.<sup>14</sup>
