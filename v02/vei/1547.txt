{@Nāman,@}¦ ‘name,’ is a common word from the Rigveda
onwards. The Gṛhya Sūtras<sup>1</sup> give elaborate rules for the
formation of the names of children, but more important is
the distinction between the secret ({%guhya%}) and the ordinary
name, though the rules as to the secret name are not at all
consistent. The secret name is already recognized in the
Rigveda,<sup>2</sup> and is referred to in the Brāhmaṇas,<sup>3</sup> one secret
name, that of Arjuna for Indra, being given in the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa.<sup>4</sup> It is to be noted that the rule as to giving the
[Page1-444+ 54]
designation of a Nakṣatra (lunar asterism) as the secret name
or otherwise is not illustrated by a single recorded name of a
teacher in the Brāhmaṇas.<sup>5</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>6</sup> several times mentions the
adoption of a second name with a view to securing success,
and also refers to the adoption of another name for purposes
of distinction.<sup>7</sup>
<div n="P"/>In actual practice two names are usually found in the
Brāhmaṇas, the second being a patronymic or a metronymic,
as in {@Kakṣīvant Auśija@}<sup>8</sup> (if the story of the slave woman Uśij
as his mother is correct), or {@Bṛhaduktha Vāmneya,@}<sup>9</sup> ‘son of
Vāmnī,’ though the relationship may, of course, be not direct
parentage, but more remote descent.<sup>10</sup> Three names are less
common — for example, {@Kūśāmba Svāyava Lātavya,@}<sup>11</sup> ‘son of
Svāyu, of the Lātavya (son of Latu) family,’ or {@Devataras@}
{@Śyāvasāyana Kāśyapa,@}<sup>12</sup> where the patronymic and the Gotra
name are both found. In other cases the names probably
have a local reference — {%e.g.,%} {@Kauśāmbeya@} and {@Gāṅgya.@} Fre-
quently the patronymic only is given, as {@Bhārgava, Maudgalya,@}
etc., or two patronymics are used. The simple name is often
used for the patronymic — {%e.g.,%} {@Trasadasyu.@}<sup>13</sup> In a few cases
the name of the wife is formed from the husband's name,<sup>14</sup> as
{@Uśīnarāṇī, Purukutsānī, Mudgalānī.@}
