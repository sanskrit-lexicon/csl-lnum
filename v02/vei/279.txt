{@Āśuṃ-ga@}¦ in the Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> seems to denote some sort of
animal. It is qualified by the word ‘young’ ({%śiśuka%}), and
Roth<sup>2</sup> suggests that it may mean a bird (‘swift-flying’), or
that the expression denotes ‘a foal going to its dam’ ({%āśu-ga%}).
Sāyaṇa, however, reads the accompanying word as {%śuśuka,%}
which he assumes to denote an animal. Bloomfield<sup>3</sup> renders
the two words ‘a swift ({%āśuṃga%}) foal ({%śiśuka%}),’ thus agreeing
with one of Roth's suggestions in sense, though not in the
explanation of Aśuṃga.
