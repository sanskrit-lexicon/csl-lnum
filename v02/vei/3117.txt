{@Vrāta@}¦ is found in several passages of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and
later<sup>2</sup> in the sense of ‘troop.’ In one passage of the Rigveda<sup>3</sup>
the troops of the Maruts are referred to by three different
terms — {%śardha, vrāta,%} and {%gaṇa.%} From this fact Zimmer<sup>4</sup> has
[Page2-342+ 43]
deduced that a Vedic host fought according to clan ({@Viś@}),
village ({@Grāma@}), and family, but this conclusion is hardly
warranted, there being nothing to show that there is any
intention to present a distinct series of divisions. It is not
probable that the word ever has the technical sense of ‘guild,’ as
Roth<sup>5</sup> thinks. {%Cf.%} {@Vrātapati.@}
