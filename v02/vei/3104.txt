{@Vyā-khyāna@}¦ in one passage of the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup>
clearly denotes a ‘narrative’ merely — viz., that of the dispute
of Kadrū and Suparṇī. In other passages<sup>2</sup> the word means
simply ‘commentary.’ In the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,<sup>3</sup> used
in the plural, it signifies a species of writing, apparently ‘com-
mentaries,’ though its exact relation to {@Anuvyākhyāna@} must
remain obscure. Sieg<sup>4</sup> thinks that the Vyākhyānas were forms
of narrative like {@Anvākhyāna@} and Anuvyākhyāna.
