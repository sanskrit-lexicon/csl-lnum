{@Parāśara@}¦ is mentioned with {@Śatayātu@} and {@Vasiṣṭha@} in the
Rigvedic hymn celebrating {@Sudās'@}<sup>1</sup> victory over the ten kings.
According to the Nirukta<sup>2</sup> he was a son of Vasiṣṭha, but the
Epic version makes him a son of {@Śakti@} and grandson of Vasiṣṭha.
Geldner<sup>3</sup> thinks that he is mentioned in the Rigveda along with
Śatayātu, perhaps his uncle, and his grandfather Vasiṣṭha, as
the three sages who approached Indra and won his favour for
Sudās. He is erroneously credited with the authorship of
certain hymns of the Rigveda<sup>4</sup> by the Anukramaṇī (Index).
