{@Kṛṣṭi@}¦ denotes ‘people’ in general from the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> onwards.
Its common and regular use in this sense appears to show that
the Āryans, when they invaded India, were already agricul-
turists, though the employment of the words referring to
ploughing mentioned under {@Kṛṣi@} indicates that not all of the
people devoted themselves equally to that occupation. Indra
and Agni are {%par excellence%} the lords of men (Kṛṣṭi).<sup>2</sup> Some-
times the word is further defined by the addition of an adjective
meaning ‘belonging to mankind,’ ‘of men’ ({%mānuṣīḥ,%}<sup>3</sup> {%mānavīḥ%}).<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>Special mention is frequently<sup>5</sup> made of the ‘five peoples’
({%pañca kṛṣṭayaḥ%}). The exact sense of this expression is doubtful.
