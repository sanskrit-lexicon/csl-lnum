{@Kroṣṭṛ@}¦ (lit. ‘howler’), the ‘jackal,’ is mentioned in the
Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as by nature cowardly compared with the wild boar
({@Varāha@}). In the Atharvaveda<sup>2</sup> it is spoken of as devouring
corpses. The word also occurs in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,<sup>3</sup>
where the commentator glosses it with Sṛgāla, another name of
the jackal. See also {@Lopāśa.@}
