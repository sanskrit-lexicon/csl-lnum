{@Udumbara.@}¦ — This name of the {%Ficus glomerata%} does not occur
in the Rigveda, but is often found from the Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup>
onwards. For ritual purposes of all kinds its wood was
constantly used. The sacrificial post ({%yūpa%})<sup>2</sup> and the sacrificial
ladle<sup>3</sup> were made of it, and amulets of Udumbara are
mentioned.<sup>4</sup> Its wood, like that of other kinds of figtree — 
{@Aśvattha, Nyagrodha,@} and {@Plakṣa@} — was considered suitable
for employment at the sacrifice.<sup>5</sup> The sweetness of its fruit is
referred to in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>6</sup> where it is put on the
same level as {@Madhu.@} It is there also spoken of as ripening
three times a year.<sup>7</sup> A forest of Udumbara trees is mentioned
in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.<sup>8</sup>
