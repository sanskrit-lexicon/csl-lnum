who are referred to in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> as living
beyond the Himālaya ({%pareṇa Himavantam%}) in the neigh-
bourhood of the {@Uttara Kurus,@} probably, as Zimmer<sup>3</sup> con-
jectures, in the land of Kaśmīr. The Madras mentioned in
the Upaniṣad were, like the {@Kurus,@} probably settled some-
where in {@Kurukṣetra@} in the {@Madhyadeśa@} or ‘Middle Land.’
