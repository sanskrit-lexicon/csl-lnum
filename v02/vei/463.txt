{@Aiṣā-vīra.@}¦ — The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa once<sup>1</sup> refers to the
Aiṣā-vīras as officiating at a sacrifice, with the implication that
they were bad sacrificers. Sāyaṇa regards the word as a
proper name (‘descendants of Eṣavīra’), denoting the members
of a despised family. But Roth may be right in explaining
the word both in the passage mentioned above and elsewhere
as meaning ‘weak’<sup>2</sup> or ‘insignificant man.’<sup>3</sup>
