3. {@Mṛga Hastin,@}¦ the ‘animal with a hand,’ is mentioned in
two passages of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> in which Roth<sup>2</sup> recognizes that
the elephant is meant, but concludes that the compound name
[Page2-172+ 54]
is a proof of the newness of the elephant to the Vedic Indians.<sup>3</sup>
Later the adjective Hastin alone became the regular name of
the animal (like {@Mahiṣa@} of the ‘buffalo’). The elephant is
also denoted in the Rigveda by the descriptive term Mṛga
Vāraṇa,<sup>4</sup> the ‘wild or dangerous animal,’ the adjective {%vāraṇa%}
similarly becoming one of the names for ‘elephant’ in the later
language. Pischel's view<sup>5</sup> that the catching of elephants by
the use of tame female elephants is already alluded to in the
Rigveda<sup>6</sup> seems very doubtful. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>7</sup>
elephants are described as ‘black, white-toothed, adorned with
gold.’

<F>3) Pischel, {%Vedische Studien,%} 1, 99, 100,
combats the view that the elephant was
new to the Vedic Indian, because of
the similar use of {%mṛga mahiṣa%} and
{%mṛga sūkara%} (Av. xii. 1, 48) to denote
the ‘buffalo’ and the ‘boar’ respec-
tively. But {@Mahiṣa@} seems rather to
bear out Roth's conclusion; while
{@Sūkara@} appears alone in the Rigveda,
and {%mṛga sūkara,%} ‘wild hog,’ seems to
be used in one passage of the Av.
(xii. 1, 48) to distinguish it from {@Varāha,@}
‘boar,’ in the same verse.</F>
