{@Sūrya,@}¦ the ‘sun,’ plays a great part in Vedic mythology and
religion,<sup>1</sup> corresponding with the importance of the sun as a
factor in the physical life of the peninsula. In the Rigveda<sup>2</sup>
the sun is normally regarded as a beneficent power, a not
unnatural view in a people which must apparently have issued
from the cold regions of the Himālaya mountains. Its heat
is, however, alluded to in some passages of the Rigveda,<sup>3</sup> as
well as referred to in the Atharvaveda and the literature of the
Brāhmaṇas.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>In one myth Indra is said to have vanquished Sūrya and to
have stolen his wheel:<sup>5</sup> this is possibly a reference to the
[Page2-466+ 62]
obscuration of the sun by a thunderstorm.<sup>6</sup> The Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa<sup>7</sup> presents a naive conception of the course of the
sun, which it regards as bright on one side only, and as
returning from west to east by the same road, but with the
reverse side turned towards the earth, thus at night illumining
the stars in heaven.<sup>8</sup> In the Rigveda<sup>9</sup> wonder is expressed
that the sun does not fall.
<div n="P"/>There are several references to eclipses in the Rigveda. In
one passage<sup>10</sup> Svarbhānu, a demon, is said to have eclipsed the
sun with darkness, while {@Atri@} restores the light of the sun, a
similar feat being elsewhere attributed to his family, the Atris.<sup>11</sup>
In the Atharvaveda<sup>12</sup> {@Rāhu@} appears for the first time in con-
nexion with the sun. Indra's defeat of Sūrya<sup>6</sup> may also be
explained as alluding to an eclipse; in two other passages<sup>13</sup>
such an interpretation seems at least probable. Ludwig<sup>14</sup> not
only argues that the Rigveda knows the theory of eclipses
caused by an occultation of the sun by the moon, and regards
the sun as going round the earth,<sup>15</sup> but even endeavours to
identify an eclipse referred to in the Rigveda with one that
occurred in 1029 B.C. These views are completely refuted by
Whitney.<sup>16</sup>
<div n="P"/>The sun as a maker of time<sup>17</sup> determines the year of 360 days,
which is the civil year and the usual year ({@Saṃvatsara@}) of
[Page2-467+ 70]
Vedic literature. This solar year is divided into two halves — 
the Uttarāyaṇa,<sup>18</sup> when the sun goes north, and the Dakṣiṇā-
yana,<sup>19</sup> when it goes south. There can be no doubt that these
periods denote the time when the sun turns north from the
winter solstice, and when it turns south from the summer
solstice, for the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa<sup>20</sup> says so in perfectly clear
language. The alternative theory is to regard the periods as
those when the sun is in the north — {%i.e.,%} when it is north of the
equator, and when it is in the south, taking as points of depar-
ture the equinoxes, not the solstices; but this view has no
support in Vedic literature, and is opposed to the fact that
the equinoxes play no part in Vedic astronomical theory.<sup>21</sup>
There are only doubtful references to the solstices in the
Rigveda.<sup>22</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Brāhmaṇas,<sup>23</sup> and perhaps the Rigveda,<sup>24</sup> regard the
moon as entering the sun at new moon. According to Hille-
brandt,<sup>25</sup> the Rigveda<sup>26</sup> recognizes that the moon shines
by the borrowed light of the sun, but this seems very doubt-

In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 3,
the two Ayanas are equated each with
three seasons — the northern course with
spring, summer, and rains; the southern
with autumn, winter, and cool season.
But this is merely an inevitable in-
accuracy, since no real season begins
with the winter solstice.</F>

i. 110, 2, a mention of the inclination
of the ecliptic to the equator, and in
x. 86, 4, a reference to the axis of the
earth. {%Cf.%} Tilak, {%Orion,%} 158 {%et seq.;%}

These views are clearly quite wrong.
The notions of the sun given in the
Brāhmaṇas are all very naive and
simple; the distance of heaven and
the sun from the earth is the height
of a thousand cows one on the top
of the other (Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
xvi. 8, 6), or forty-four days' journey
for a horse ({%ibid.,%} xxv. 10, 16), or a
thousand days' journey for a horse
(Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 17, 8), or a
hundred leagues (Kausītaki Brāhmaṇa,
viii. 3). They record also such facts
as that the sun rises from and sets in
the waters (Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 20,
13; {%of.%} Nirukta, vi. 17; Kauṣītaki
Brāhmaṇa, xxiv. 4, 5; xxvi. 1), and
that it sets in the west ({%ibid.,%} xviii. 9).
The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa calls the sun
circular (vii. 4, 1, 17), and also four-
cornered ({%catuḥ-śrakti%}) in xiv. 3, 1, 17,
and so on. See Weber, {%Indische Studien,%}
