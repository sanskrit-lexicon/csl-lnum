{@Graha@}¦ (‘seizing’) is a term applied to the sun in the Śata-
patha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>1</sup> most probably not in the later sense of
‘planet,’ but to denote a power exercising magical influence.<sup>2</sup>
The sense of ‘planet’ seems first to occur in the later literature,
as in the Maitrāyaṇī Upaniṣad.<sup>3</sup> The question whether the
planets were known to the Vedic Indians is involved in
obscurity. Oldenberg<sup>4</sup> recognizes them in the Ādityas, whose
number is, he believes, seven; sun, moon, and the five planets.
But this view, though it cannot be said to be impossible or even
unlikely, is not susceptible of proof, and has been rejected by
Hillebrandt,<sup>5</sup> Pischel,<sup>6</sup> von Schroeder,<sup>7</sup> Macdonell,<sup>8</sup> and Bloom-
field,<sup>9</sup> among others. Hillebrandt<sup>10</sup> sees the planets in the five
Adhvaryus mentioned in the Rigveda,<sup>11</sup> but this is a mere con-
jecture. The five bulls ({%ukṣāṇaḥ%}) in another passage of the
Rigveda<sup>12</sup> have received a similar interpretation with equal
uncertainty,<sup>13</sup> and Durga, in his commentary on the Nirukta,<sup>14</sup>
even explains the term {%bhūmija,%} ‘earth-born,’ which is only men-
tioned by Yāska, as meaning the planet Mars.<sup>15</sup> Thibaut,<sup>16</sup>
who is generally sceptical as to the mention of planets in the
Veda, thinks that Bṛhaspati there refers to Jupiter; but this is
extremely improbable, though in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>17</sup>
Bṛhaspati is made the regent of Tiṣya. A reference to the
[Page1-244+ 55]
planets is much more probable in the seven suns ({%sapta sūryāḥ%})
of the late Taittirīya Āraṇyaka.<sup>18</sup> On the other hand, Ludwig's
efforts to find the five planets with the sun, the moon, and the
twenty-seven Nakṣatras (lunar mansions) in the Rigveda, as
corresponding to the number thirty-four used in connexion with
light<sup>19</sup> ({%jyotis%}) and the ribs of the sacrificial horse,<sup>20</sup> is far-
fetched. See also {@Śukra, Manthin, Vena.@}
