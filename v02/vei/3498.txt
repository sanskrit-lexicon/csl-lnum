{@Samrāj@}¦ in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later<sup>2</sup> means ‘superior ruler,
‘sovereign,’ as expressing a greater degree of power than ‘king’
({@Rājan@}). In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>3</sup> in accordance with its
curious theory of the {@Vājapeya@} and {@Rājasūya,@} the Samrāj is
asserted to be a higher authority than a king, and to have
become one by the sacrifice of the Vājapeya. There is, how-
ever, no trace of the use of the word as ‘emperor’ in the sense
of an ‘overlord of kings,’ probably because political conditions
furnished no example of such a status, as for instance was
attained in the third century B.C. by Aśoka. At the same time
Samrāj denotes an important king like {@Janaka@} of {@Videha.@}<sup>4</sup> It
is applied in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>5</sup> as the title of the eastern
kings. {%Cf.%} {@Rājya.@}

it is Virāj: for the southerners, Svarāj;

nara), Rājan simply. This is probably
a sound tradition.</F>
