{@Saktu@}¦ in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas<sup>1</sup> denotes
‘coarsely ground meal,’ ‘groats,’ especially ‘barley meal.’ In
the Rigveda,<sup>2</sup> where the word occurs only once, it seems rather
to mean grain before it is winnowed by the {@Titaü.@} If the
latter word, however, designates a ‘sieve,’ Saktu might still
mean ‘groats,’ as opposed to fine meal.
