{@Puru-mīḷha@}¦ is mentioned twice in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as an ancient
sage, in which capacity he appears in the Atharvaveda<sup>2</sup> also.
Perhaps the same<sup>3</sup> Purumīḷha is intended in an obscure hymn
in the Rigveda,<sup>4</sup> where, according to the legends reported in
the Bṛhaddevatā<sup>5</sup> and by Ṣaḍguruśiṣya in his commentary on
the Sarvānukramaṇī,<sup>6</sup> and by Sāyaṇa in his commentary on the
Rigveda,<sup>4</sup> he as well as {@Taranta@} was a son of Vidadaśva, and
a patron of the singer {@Śyāvāśva.@} The correctness of the legend
has been shown to be most improbable by Oldenberg,<sup>7</sup> who
points out<sup>8</sup> that the legend misinterprets the Rigveda by
making Purumīḷha a Vaidadaśvi, for he is there only compared
in generosity to one.
<div n="P"/>In another legend found in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>9</sup> and
based on a hymn of the Rigveda,<sup>10</sup> Purumīḷha and Taranta
appear as persons who received gifts from {@Dhvasra@} and {@Puru-@}
{@ṣanti,@} and as sons of Vidadaśva. The legend, which also
occurs in the Śāṭyāyanaka,<sup>11</sup> is apparently best explained by
[Page1-544+ 12]
Sieg,<sup>12</sup> who says that as the two were kings they could not
under the rules of caste accept gifts, unless for the nonce they
became singers. The legend has no claim at all, as Oldenberg<sup>13</sup>
shows, to validity.

points out, {%Ṛgveda-Noten,%} 1, 354, that
the legend is not accepted by the
Anukramaṇī (Index), since its list of
authors gives Avatsāra as the Ṛṣi, not
the two Taranta and Purumīḷha.</F>
