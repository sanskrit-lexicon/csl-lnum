{@Mṛga-vyādha,@}¦ ‘the hunter,’ is the name of Sirius in the
legend of Prajāpati's daughter in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>1</sup>
Prajāpati (Orion) pursues his daughter (Rohiṇī), and is shot
by the archer Sirius. The transference of the legend of
Prajāpati to the sky is no doubt secondary, caused by the
obvious similarity of the constellation in question to the idea
of an archer.
