{@Pitā-maha,@}¦ beside {@Tatāmaha,@} denotes from the Atharvaveda
onwards<sup>1</sup> the ‘paternal grandfather,’ apparently as a ‘father in
a higher sense.’<sup>2</sup> The great-grandfather is {@Prapitāmaha@} and
{@Pratatāmaha.@}<sup>3</sup> It is significant that there are no corrésponding
Vedic words for maternal grandparents, and that the words
used in the latter language, such as Mātāmaha, are imitations
of the terms for paternal relations.
<div n="P"/>In one passage of the Rigveda<sup>4</sup> Delbrück<sup>5</sup> suggests that
{%mahe pitre%} means ‘grandfather,’ a sense which would well suit
the {%napātam,%} ‘grandson,’ following, but the sense of the whole
passage is uncertain.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>We learn very little from the texts of the position of grand-
parents. No doubt they were entitled to marks of respect
similar to those shown to parents,<sup>7</sup> as the epic expressly
testifies. A grandfather might easily be the head of the family,
or be living with his eldest son, after he ceased to be able to
control the family.
<div n="P"/>The grandmother (Pitāmahī) is not mentioned in the extant
Vedic literature.
