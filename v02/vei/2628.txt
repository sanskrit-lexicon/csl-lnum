{@Ratha-kāra,@}¦ ‘chariot-maker,’ is mentioned in the Atharva-
veda<sup>1</sup> as one of those who are to be subject to the king, seeming
to stand generally as an example of the industrial population.
He is also referred to in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās<sup>2</sup> and in the
Brāhmaṇas:<sup>3</sup> in all these passages, as well a probably in the
Atharvaveda also, the Rathakāra already forms a caste. The
[Page2-204+ 45]
later system<sup>4</sup> regards the Rathakāra as the offspring of a
Māhiṣya (the son of a Kṣatriya husband and a Vaiśya wife) and
a Karaṇī (the daughter of a Vaiśya husband and a Śūdra wife),
but it is unreasonable to suppose that such an origin is
historically accurate. The Rathakāras must rather be deemed
to have been a functional caste. Hillebrandt<sup>5</sup> suggests that
the {@Anu@} tribe formed the basis of the Rathakāra caste, referring
to their worship of the Ṛbhus, who are, of course, the chariot-
makers {%par excellence.%} But there is little ground for this view.
