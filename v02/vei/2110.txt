{@Plā-yogi,@}¦ ‘descendant of Playoga,’ is the patronymic of
{@Āsaṅga@} in the Rigveda.<sup>1</sup> According to the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta
Sūtra,<sup>2</sup> Āsaṅga was a woman, but became a man. This version,
repeated by Sāyaṇa in his commentary on the Rigveda,<sup>3</sup> is a
mere blunder based on the fact that an additional verse, tacked
on to the hymn,<sup>3</sup> contains the expression {%śaśvatī nārī,%} which
has been taken to mean ‘his wife Śaśvatī,’<sup>4</sup> instead of merely
‘every woman.’
