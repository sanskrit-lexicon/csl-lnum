{@Apī.@}¦ — Ludwig<sup>1</sup> finds an Apī whose sons are described as
not performing sacrifice ({%a-yajña-sāc%}) and as breakers of the
law of Mitra-Varuṇa in the Rigveda.<sup>2</sup> Roth<sup>3</sup> and Grassmann
take the expression used ({%apyaḥ putrāḥ%}) as referring to the sons
of the waters.
