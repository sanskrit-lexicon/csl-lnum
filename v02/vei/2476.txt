{@Māsa@}¦ denotes a ‘month,’ a period of time repeatedly men-
tioned in the Rigveda and later.
<div n="P"/>The characteristic days (or rather nights) of the month were
those of the new moon, Amā-vasyā, ‘home-staying (night),’ and
‘of the full moon,’ Paurṇa-māsī. Two hymns of the Atharva-
veda<sup>1</sup> celebrate these days respectively. A personification of
the phases of the moon is seen in the four names Sinīvālī,<sup>2</sup>
[Page2-157+ 72]
the day before new moon; Kuhū,<sup>3</sup> also called Guṅgū,<sup>4</sup> the
new moon day; Anumati,<sup>5</sup> the day before full moon; and
Rākā,<sup>6</sup> the day of new moon. The importance of the new and
full moon days is seen in the Darśa-pūrṇamāsau, or festivals
of the new and full moon days respectively.
<div n="P"/>One special day in the month, the {@Ekāṣṭakā,@} or eighth day
after full moon, was important. In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>7</sup>
there are stated to be in the year twelve such, mentioned
between the twelve days of full moon and the twelve days of
new moon. But one Ekāṣṭakā is referred to in the Yajurveda
Saṃhitās and elsewhere<sup>8</sup> as of quite special importance. This
was, in the accordant opinion of most commentators, the
eighth day after the full moon of {@Māgha.@} It marked the end
of the year, or the beginning of the new year. Though the
Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa<sup>9</sup> places the winter solstice in the new
moon of Māgha, the latter date probably means the new moon
preceding full moon in Māgha,<sup>10</sup> not the new moon following
[Page2-158+ 74]
full moon; but it is perhaps possible to account adequately for
the importance of the Ekāṣṭakā as being the first Aṣṭakā
after the beginning of the new year.
<div n="P"/>It is not certain exactly how the month was reckoned, whether
from the day after new moon to new moon — the system known
as {%amānta,%} or from the day after full moon to full moon — the {%pūr-%}
{%ṇimānta%} system, which later, at any rate, was followed in North
India, while the other system prevailed in the south. Jacobi<sup>11</sup>
argues that the year began in the full moon of Phālguna, and
that only by the full moon's conjunction with the Nakṣatra could
the month be known. Oldenberg<sup>12</sup> points to the fact that the
new moon is far more distinctively an epoch than the full
moon; that the Greek, Roman, and Jewish years began with
the new moon; and that the Vedic evidence is the division of
the month into the former ({%pūrva%}) and latter ({%apara%}) halves,
the first being the bright ({%śukla%}), the second the dark ({%kṛṣṇa%})
period. Thibaut<sup>13</sup> considers that to assume the existence of
the {%pūrṇimānta%} system for the Veda is unnecessary, though
possible. Weber<sup>10</sup> assumes that it occurs in the Kauṣītaki
Brāhmaṇa as held by the scholiasts. But it would probably
be a mistake to press that passage, or to assume that the
{%amānta%} system was rigidly accepted in the Veda: it seems at
least as probable that the month was vaguely regarded as
beginning with the new moon day, so that new moon preceded
full moon, which was in the middle, not the end or the
beginning of the month.
<div n="P"/>That a month regularly had 30 days is established by the
conclusive evidence of numerous passages in which the year is
given 12 months and 360 days. This month is known from the
earliest records, being both referred to directly and alluded to.<sup>14</sup>
[Page2-159+ 55]
It is the regular month of the Brāhmaṇas,<sup>15</sup> and must be
regarded as the month which the Vedic Indian recognized.
No other month is mentioned as such in the Brāhmaṇa
literature; it is only in the Sūtras that months of different
length occur. The Sāmaveda Sūtras<sup>16</sup> refer to (1) years with
324 days — {%i.e.,%} periodic years with 12 months of 27 days each;
(2) years with 351 days — {%i.e.,%} periodic years with 12 months of
27 days each, plus another month of 27 days; (3) years with
354 days — {%i.e.,%} 6 months of 30 days, and 6 with 29 days, in
other words, lunar synodic years; (4) years with 360 days, or
ordinary civil ({%sāvana%}) years; (5) years with 378 days, which,
as Thibaut<sup>17</sup> clearly shows, are third years, in which, after
two years of 360 days each, 18 days were added to bring about
correspondence between the civil year and the solar year of
366 days. But even the Sāmasūtras do not mention the year
of 366 days, which is first known to the Jyotiṣa<sup>18</sup> and to
Garga.<sup>19</sup>
<div n="P"/>That the Vedic period was acquainted with the year of
354 days cannot be affirmed with certainty. Zimmer,<sup>20</sup> indeed,
thinks that it is proved by the fact that pregnancy is estimated
at ten months, or sometimes a year.<sup>21</sup> But Weber<sup>22</sup> may be
right in holding that the month is the periodic month of
27 days, for the period is otherwise too long if a year is taken.
On the other hand, the period of ten months quite well suits
the period of gestation, if birth takes place in the tenth month,
so that in this sense the month of 30 days may well be meant.
[Page2-160+ 57]
<div n="P"/>The year of 12 months of 30 days each being admittedly
quite unscientific, Zimmer<sup>23</sup> is strongly of opinion that it was
only used with a recognition of the fact that intercalation took
place, and that the year formed part of a greater complex,
normally the five your Yuga or cycle. This system is well
known from the Jyotṣa: it consists of 62 months of 29(16/31) days
each = 1, 830 days (two of these months being intercalary, one
in the middle and one at the end), or 61 months of 30 days,
or 60 months of 30(1/2) days, the unit being clearly a solar year
of 366 days. It is not an ideal system, since the year is too
long;<sup>24</sup> but it is one which cannot be claimed even for the
Brāhmaṇa period, during which no decision as to the true
length of the year seems to have been arrived at. The
references to it seen by Zimmer in the Rigveda<sup>25</sup> are not even
reasonably plausible, while the {%pañcaka yuga,%} cited by him from
the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>26</sup> occurs only in a quotation in
a commentary, and had no authority for the text itself.
<div n="P"/>On the other hand, there was undoubtedly some attempt to
bring the year of 360 days — a synodic lunar year — roughly
into connexion with reality. A Sāmasūtra<sup>27</sup> treats it as a
solar year, stating that he sun perambulates each Naxatra in
13(1/3) days, while others again evidently interpolated 18 days
every third year, in order to arrive at some equality. But
Vedic literature, from the Rigveda<sup>28</sup> downwards,<sup>29</sup> teems with
the assertion of the difficulty of ascertaining the month.
The length is variously given as 30 days,<sup>30</sup> 35 days,<sup>31</sup> or
[Page2-161+ 63]
36 days.<sup>32</sup> The last number possibly indicates an intercalation
after six years (6×6 = 36, or for ritual purposes 35), but for
this we have no special evidence. There are many references<sup>33</sup>
to the year having 12 or 13 months.
<div n="P"/>The names of the months are, curiously enough, not at all
ancient. The sacrificial texts of the Yajurveda give them in
their clearest form where the Agnicayana, ‘building of the
fire-altar,’ is described.<sup>34</sup> These names are the following:
(1) Madhu, (2) Mādhava (spring months, {%vāsantikāv ṛtū%});
(3) Śukra, (4) Śuci (summer months, {%graiṣmāv ṛtū%}); (5) Nabha
(or Nabhas),<sup>35</sup> (6) Nabhasya (rainy months, {%vārṣikāv ṛtū%});
(7) Iṣa, (8) Ūrja (autumn months, {%śāradāv ṛtū%}); (9) Saha (or
Sahas),<sup>35</sup> (10) Sahasya (winter months, {%haimantikāv ṛtū%});
(11) Tapa (or Tapas),<sup>35</sup> (12) Tapasya (cool months, {%śaiśirāv%}
{%ṛtū%}).
<div n="P"/>There are similar lists in the descriptions of the Soma
sacrifice<sup>36</sup> and of the horse sacrifice,<sup>37</sup> all of them agreeing in
essentials. There are other lists of still more fanciful names,<sup>38</sup>
but these have no claim at all to represent actual divisions in
popular use. It is doubtful if the list given above is more than
a matter of priestly invention. Weber points out that Madhu
and Mādhava later appear as names of spring, and that these
two are mentioned in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka<sup>39</sup> as if actually
[Page2-162+ 59]
employed; but the evidence is very inadequate to show that
the other names of the months given in the list were in ordinary
use.<sup>40</sup>
<div n="P"/>In some of these lists the intercalary month is mentioned.
The name given to it in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>41</sup> is Aṃhasas-
pati, while that given in the Taittirīya<sup>42</sup> and Maitrāyaṇī
Saṃhitās<sup>43</sup> is Saṃsarpa. The Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>44</sup> gives it the
name of Malimluca, which also occurs elsewhere, along with
Saṃsarpa, in one of the lists of fanciful names.<sup>45</sup> The
Atharvaveda<sup>46</sup> describes it as {%sanisrasa,%} ‘slipping,’ owing no
doubt to its unstable condition.
<div n="P"/>The other method of naming the months is from the
{@Nakṣatras.@} It is only beginning to be used in the Brāhmaṇas,
but is found regularly in the Epic and later. The Jyotiṣa<sup>47</sup>
mentions that Māgha and Tapa were identical: this is the fair
interpretation of the passage, which also involves the identifica-
tion of Madhu with Caitra, a result corresponding with the
view frequently found in the Brāhmaṇas, that the full moon in
Citrā, and not that in Phalgunī, is the beginning of the year.<sup>48</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>49</sup> are found two curious ex-
pressions, {%yava%} and {%ayava,%} for the light and dark halves of the
month, which is clearly considered to begin with the light half.
Possibly the words are derived, as Eggling<sup>50</sup> thinks, from {%yu,%}
‘ward off,’ with reference to evil spirits. The word {@Parvan@}
[Page2-163+ 54]
(‘joint’ = division of time) probably<sup>51</sup> denotes a half of the
month, perhaps already in the Rigveda.<sup>52</sup> More precisely the
first half, the time of the waxing light, is called {%pūrva-pakṣa,%}<sup>53</sup>
the second, that of the waning light, {%apara-pakṣa,%}<sup>54</sup> Either of
these might be called a half-month ({%ardha-māsa%}).<sup>55</sup>

<F>48) Weber's theory (359) that Caitra
was as the first spring month secondary
to Phālguna is, of course, an error;
for, owing to the precession of the
equinoxes, Phālguna became the first
month of spring {%de facto,%} while Caitra
became virtually the last month of the
preceding season. The truth is that
the six seasons are an arbitrary division
of the year, and that either Phālguna
or Caitra could be regarded as the
beginning of spring without much im-
propriety. See Weber, {%Indische Studien,%}
