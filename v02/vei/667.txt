{@Kuśri Vāja-śravasa@}¦ appears as a teacher concerned with the
lore of the sacred fire in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>1</sup> and in the
last Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad<sup>2</sup>
he is mentioned as a pupil of {@Vājaśravas.@} It is not clear
whether he is identical with the Kuśri of the last Vaṃśa of the
Bṛhadāraṇyaka<sup>3</sup> in the Kāṇva recension, and of the Vaṃśa in
the tenth book of the Śatapatha,<sup>4</sup> who is mentioned as a pupil
of {@Yajñavacas Rājastambāyana.@}
