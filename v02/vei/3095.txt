{@Vaiśya@}¦ denotes a man, not so much of the people, as of the
subject class, distinct from the ruling noble ({@Kṣatriya@}) and the
{@Brāhmaṇa,@} the higher strata of the Āryan community on the
one side, and from the aboriginal {@Śūdra@} on the other. The
name is first found in the Puruṣa-sūkta (‘hymn of man’) in
the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> and then frequently from the Atharvaveda<sup>2</sup>
onwards,<sup>3</sup> sometimes in the form of Viśya.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Vaiśya plays singularly little part in Vedic literature,
which has much to say of Kṣatriya and Brahmin. His
characteristics are admirably summed up in the Aitareya Brāh-
maṇa<sup>5</sup> in the adjectives {%anyasya bali-kṛt,%} ‘tributary to another’;
{%anyasyādya,%} ‘to be lived upon by another’; and {%yathākāma-%}
{%jyeyaḥ,%} ‘to be oppressed at will.’ He was unquestionably taxed
by the king ({@Rājan@}), who no doubt assigned to his retinue the
right of support by the people, so that the Kṣatriyas grew more
and more to depend on the services rendered to them by the
Vaiśyas. But the Vaiśya was not a slave: he could not be
killed by the king or anyone else without the slayer incurring
risk and the payment of a wergeld ({@Vaira@}), which even in the
Brahmin books extends to 100 cows for a Vaiśya. Moreover,
though the Vaiśya could be expelled by the king at pleasure, he
cannot be said to have been without property in his land.
Hopkins<sup>6</sup> thinks it is absurd to suppose that he could really be
a landowner when he was subject to removal at will, but this
is to ignore the fact that normally the king could not remove
the landowner, and that kings were ultimately dependent on
the people, as the tales of exiled kings show.
<div n="P"/>On the other hand, Hopkins<sup>7</sup> is clearly right in holding that
the Vaiśya was really an agriculturist, and that Vedic society
was not merely a landholding aristocracy, superimposed upon
an agricultural aboriginal stock, as Baden Powell<sup>8</sup> urged.
Without ignoring the possibility that the Dravidians were
agriculturists, there is no reason to deny that the Āryans were
[Page2-334+ 44]
so likewise, and the goad of the plougher was the mark of a
Vaiśya in life<sup>9</sup> and in death.<sup>10</sup> It would be absurd to suppose
that the Āryan Vaiśyas did not engage in industry and com-
merce ({%cf.%} {@Paṇi, Vaṇij@}), but pastoral pursuits and agriculture
must have been their normal occupations.
<div n="P"/>In war the Vaiśyas must have formed the bulk of the force
under the Kṣatriya leaders (see {@Kṣatriya@}). But like the
Homeric commoners, the Vaiśyas may well have done little of
the serious fighting, being probably ill-provided with either
body armour or offensive weapons.
<div n="P"/>That the Vaiśyas were engaged in the intellectual life of the
day is unlikely; nor is there any tradition, corresponding to
that regarding the Kṣatriyas, of their having taken part in the
evolution of the doctrine of Brahman, the great philosophic
achievement of the age. The aim of the Vaiśya's ambition
was, according to the Taittirīya Saṃhitā,<sup>11</sup> to become a
{@Grāmaṇī,@} or village headman, a post probably conferred by the
king on wealthy Vaiśyas, of whom no doubt there were many.
It is impossible to say if in Vedic times a Vaiśya could attain to
nobility or become a Brahmin. No instance can safely be
quoted in support of such a view,<sup>12</sup> though such changes of
status may have taken place (see {@Kṣatriya@} and {@Varṇa@}).
<div n="P"/>It is denied by Fick<sup>13</sup> that the Vaiśyas were ever a caste, and
the denial is certainly based on good grounds if it is held that
a caste means a body within which marriage is essential, and
which follows a hereditary occupation ({%cf.%} {@Varṇa@}). But it
would be wrong<sup>14</sup> to suppose that the term Vaiśya was merely
applied by theorists to the people who were not nobles or
priests. It must have been an early appellation of a definite
class which was separate from the other classes, and properly
to be compared with them. Moreover, though there were
differences among Vaiśyas, there were equally differences
among Kṣatriyas and Brāhmanas, and it is impossible to deny
[Page2-335+ 41]
the Vaiśyas' claim to be reckoned a class or caste it the other
two are such, though at the present day things are different.
