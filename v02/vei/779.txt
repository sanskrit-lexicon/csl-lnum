2. {@Krunc Āṅgirasa@}¦ is in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> the
name of the seer of a Sāman or Chant called the Krauñca. It
is doubtless invented to explain the name of the Chant on the
ordinary principle that Sāmans are called after their authors,
though this rule has many exceptions.<sup>2</sup>
