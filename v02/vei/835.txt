{@Gaṅgā,@}¦ the modern Ganges, is mentioned directly in the
Rigveda only once, in the Nadī-stuti or ‘Praise of Rivers.’<sup>1</sup>
But it is also referred to in the derivative form {%gāṅgyaḥ%} as an
epithet of {@Urukakṣa.@}<sup>3</sup> The name of this river does not occur

[Page1-218+ 43]
in the other Saṃhitā, but appears in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>4</sup>
where victories of {@Bharata Dauḥṣanti@} on both Gaṅgā and
{@Yamunā@} are referred to, and in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka<sup>5</sup>
especial honour is assigned to those who dwell between the
Gaṅgā and the Yamunā, this being. To doubt, the region in
which that text originated. The identification of the Gaṅgā

{@Āpayā.@}
