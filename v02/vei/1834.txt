{@Piśāca@}¦ is the name of a class of demon mentioned in the
Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> and later.<sup>2</sup> In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>3</sup> they are
associated with Rakṣases and Asuras, while opposed to gods,
men, and fathers. In the Atharvaveda<sup>4</sup> they are described as
{%kravyād,%} ‘eaters of raw flesh,’ which may be the etymological
sense of the word Piśāca itself.<sup>5</sup> It is possible that the Piśācas
were, as suggested by Grierson,<sup>6</sup> really human foes, like the
north-western tribes, who even in later times were reputed
eaters of raw flesh (not necessarily as cannibals, but rather as
eaters of human flesh in ritual). This is, however, not at all
likely, the Piśācas having in all probability only meant ‘ghouls’
originally: when they appear as human tribes, they were
presumably thus designated in scorn. A science called Piśāca-
veda<sup>7</sup> or Piśāca-vidyā<sup>8</sup> is known in the later Vedic period.
