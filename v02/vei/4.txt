1. {@Akṣa,@}¦ ‘axle,’ is a part of a chariot often referred to in
the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later. It was apparently<sup>2</sup> fastened to the
body of the chariot ({@Kośa@}) by straps ({%akṣā-nah,%} lit. ‘tied to the
axle,’ though this word is also<sup>3</sup> rendered ‘horse’). The
heating of the axle and the danger of its breaking were known.<sup>4</sup>
The part of the axle round which the nave of the wheel
revolved was called Āṇi, ‘pin.’
