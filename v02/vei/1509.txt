{@Nada@}¦ is found in several passages of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> but its
sense is still obscure. It is identified by Pischel<sup>2</sup> with {@Naḍa,@}
being explained by him in one passage<sup>3</sup> as a reed boat, which
is split, and over which the waters go; in another<sup>4</sup> as a reed
whip, of which the sharp points ({%karṇa%}) are used to urge horses
on; and in others<sup>5</sup> again as figuratively designating the penis.
Roth<sup>6</sup> takes the sense to be ‘bull’ (either literally or meta-
[Page1-434+ 45]
phorically) in all passages. Once at least<sup>7</sup> the ‘neigher’ (from
the root {%nad,%} ‘sound’) seems to be meant with reference to
Indra's horse. In the phrase {%nadasya karṇaiḥ%}^8 the sense is,
perhaps, ‘through the ears of the (side) horse’ (that is, by their
being ready to hear the word of command) of their chariot,
the Maruts ‘hasten on with their swift steeds’ ({%turayanta%}
{%āśubhiḥ%}).

<F>4) ii. 34, 3, followed by Max Müller,
{%Sacred Books of the East,%} 32, 301 (who,
however, does not construe {%āśubhiḥ,%}
‘sharp,’ with {%karṇaiḥ%} as Pischel does
in {%Vedische Studien,%} 1, 190). He sees
‘reed’ also in x. 11, 2, but ‘horse’ in
x. 105, 4.</F>

<F>6) St. Petersburg Dictionary, {%s.v.%} The
sense of ‘bull’ seems imperative in
viii. 89, 2; it is admissible in i. 179, 4,
where ‘bull’ may denote a man, and
in x. 11, 2, and possibly in i. 32, 8,
but ‘reed’ there seems far more likely.</F>
<F>7) x. 105, 4. and in x. 11, 2. The
latter passage suggests that ‘river’
may, after all, be the sense there.
