1. {@Janam-ejaya@}¦ (‘man-impelling’) is the name of a king,
a {@Pārikṣita,@}<sup>1</sup> famous towards the end of the Brāhmaṇa period.
He is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> as owning
horses which when wearied were refreshed with sweet drinks,
and as a performer of the Aśvamedha, or horse sacrifice.<sup>3</sup> His
capital, according to a Gāthā quoted in the Śatapatha<sup>4</sup> and
the Aitareya Brāhmaṇas,<sup>5</sup> was {@Āsandīvant.@} His brothers
{@Ugrasena, Bhīmasena,@} and {@Śrutasena@} are mentioned as having
[Page1-274+ 49]
by the horse sacrifice purified themselves from sin. The priest
who performed the sacrifice for him was {@Indrota Daivāpi@}
{@Śaunaka.@}<sup>6</sup> On the other hand the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>7</sup> which
also mentions his Aśvamedha, names {@Tura Kāvaṣeya@} as his
priest. It also contains an obscure tale stating that at one
sacrifice of his he did not employ the {@Kaśyapas,@} but the
{@Bhūtavīras,@} being, however, induced by the {@Asitamṛgas@} to
have recourse to the Kaśyapas again.<sup>8</sup> He was a {@Kuru@} prince;
see {@Parikṣit.@} The Gopatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>9</sup> tells an absurd tale
about him, evidently as of an ancient hero.
