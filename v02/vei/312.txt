{@Itihāsa,@}¦ as a kind of literature, is repeatedly mentioned
along with {@Purāṇa@} in the later texts of the Vedic period.
The earliest reference to both occurs in the late fifteenth book
of the Atharvaveda.<sup>1</sup> Itihāsa then appears in the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa,<sup>2</sup> the Jaiminīya,<sup>3</sup> Bṛhadāraṇyaka,<sup>4</sup> and Chāndogya
Upaniṣads.<sup>5</sup> In the latter it is expressly declared with Purāṇa
to make up the fifth Veda, while the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>6</sup>
makes the Itihāsa a Veda and the Purāṇa a Veda. The
Itihāsa-veda and the Purāṇa-veda appear also in the Gopatha
Brāhmaṇa,<sup>7</sup> while the Śatapatha<sup>8</sup> identifies the Itihāsa as well
as the Purāṇa with the Veda. In one passage {@Anvākhyāna@}
and Itihāsa are distinguished<sup>9</sup> as different classes of works, but
the exact point of distinction is obscure; probably the former
was supplementary. The Taittirīya Āraṇyaka<sup>10</sup> mentions
Itihāsas and Purāṇas in the plural.
<div n="P"/>There is nothing to show in the older literature what dis-
tinction there was, if any, between Itihāsa and Purāṇa; and
the late literature,<sup>11</sup> which has been elaborately examined by
Sieg,<sup>12</sup> yields no consistent result. Geldner<sup>13</sup> has conjectured
that there existed a single work, the Itihāsa-purāṇa, a collection
[Page1-077+ 51]
of the old legends of all sorts, heroic, cosmogonic, genealogical;
but though a work called Itihāsa, and another called Purāṇa,
were probably known to Patañjali,<sup>14</sup> the inaccuracy of Geldner's
view is proved by the fact that Yāska shows no sign of having
known any such work. To him the Itihāsa may be a part of
the Mantra literature itself,<sup>15</sup> Aitihāsikas being merely people
who interpret the Rigveda by seeing in it legends where others
see myths.<sup>16</sup> The fact, however, that the use of the compound
form is rare, and that Yāska regularly has Itihāsa,<sup>17</sup> not
Itihāsa-purāṇa, is against the theory of there ever having been
one work.
<div n="P"/>The relation of Itihāsa to {@Ākhyāna@} is also uncertain. Sieg<sup>18</sup>
considers that the words Itihāsa and Purāṇa referred to the
great body of mythology, legendary history, and cosmogonic
legend available to the Vedic poets, and roughly classed as a
fifth Veda, though not definitely and finally fixed. Thus,
Anvākhyānas, {@Anuvyākhyānas,@} and {@Vyākhyānas@} could arise,
and separate Ākhyānas could still exist outside the cycle,
while an Ākhyāna could also be a part of the Itihāsa-purāṇa.
He also suggests that the word Ākhyāna has special reference
to the form of the narrative. Oldenberg,<sup>19</sup> following Windisch,<sup>20</sup>
and followed by Geldner,<sup>21</sup> Sieg, and others, has found in the
Ākhyāna form a mixture of prose and verse, alternating as
the narrative was concerned with the mere accessory parts of
the tale, or with the chief points, at which the poetic form
was naturally produced to correspond with the stress of the
emotion. This theory has been severely criticized by Hertel<sup>22</sup>
and von Schroeder.<sup>23</sup> These scholars, in accordance with
older suggestions of Max Müller<sup>24</sup> and Lévi,<sup>25</sup> see in the
[Page1-078+ 34]
so-called Ākhyāna hymns of the Rigveda, in which Oldenberg
finds actual specimens of the supposed literary genus, though
the prose has been lost, actual remains of ritual dramas.
Elsewhere<sup>26</sup> it has been suggested that the hymns in question
are merely literary dialogues.
