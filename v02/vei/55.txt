{@Adri.@}¦ — Zimmer<sup>1</sup> deduces from the use of this word (‘rock,’
‘stone’) in a passage of the Rigveda,<sup>2</sup> that sling-stones were
used in Vedic fighting. But the passage is mythical, referring
to Indra's aid, and cannot be used with any certainty as
evidence for human war. More probably it merely denotes
Indra's bolt. See also {@Aśani.@}
