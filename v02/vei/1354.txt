{@Dṛṣad@}¦ appears in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and Atharvaveda<sup>2</sup> to denote
not a millstone,<sup>3</sup> but merely a stone used to pound grain, which
was placed on another stone as a support. When used later<sup>4</sup>
[Page1-374+ 44]
in connexion with {@Upalā,@} the lower and the upper millstone, or
mortar and pestle may be meant; but this is not certain.
Eggeling<sup>5</sup> renders them as the large and small millstones. See
also {@Upara@} and {@Upalā.@}
