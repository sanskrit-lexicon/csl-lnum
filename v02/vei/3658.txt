{@Sṛñjaya@}¦ is the name of a people mentioned as early as the
Rigveda. Sṛñjaya (that is, the king of this people) {@Daivavāta@}
is celebrated as victorious over the {@Turvaśas@} and the {@Vṛcī-@}
{@vants,@}<sup>1</sup> and his sacrificial fire is referred to.<sup>2</sup> In connexion
with Daivavāta is also mentioned {@Sāhadevya Somaka,@}<sup>3</sup> no
doubt another prince; for in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> we find
Somaka Sāhadevya and his father, Sahadeva (originally {@Suplan@})
Sārñjaya, as kings who were anointed by {@Parvata@} and
{@Nārada.@} The Rigveda<sup>5</sup> has also a Dānastuti (‘praise of gifts’)
of {@Prastoka,@}<sup>6</sup> a Sṛñjaya, who is lauded along with {@Divodāsa.@}
Moreover, {@Vītahavya@}<sup>7</sup> seems to have been a Sṛñjaya, though
Zimmer<sup>8</sup> prefers to take the derivative word, {@Vaitahavya,@} not
as a patronymic, but as an epithet.
<div n="P"/>It seems probable that the Sṛñjayas and the {@Tṛtsus@} were
closely allied, for Divodāsa and a Sṛñjaya prince are celebrated
together,<sup>9</sup> and the Turvaśas were enemies of both.<sup>10</sup> This view
is borne out by the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>11</sup> which recognizes
{@Devabhāga Śrautarṣa@} as Purohita of the {@Kurus@} and the
Sṛñjayas.
[Page2-470+ 49]
<div n="P"/>On the other hand, some disaster certainly befel the Sṛñjayas,
at least the Vaitahavyas, for they are said in the Atharvaveda<sup>12</sup>
to have offended the {@Bhṛgus@} and to have ended miserably.
There is, it is true, no precise confirmation of this notice, but
both the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>13</sup> and the Taittirīya Saṃhitā,<sup>14</sup> in
independent passages, refer to the Sṛñjayas having sustained
some serious loss, though the notice is in each case coupled
with a ritual error, much as in the Old Testament the fate
of kings depends on their devotion to Jahve or their dis-
obedience. It is justifiable to recognize some disaster in this
allusion.
<div n="P"/>The geographical position of the Sṛñjayas is uncertain.
Hillebrandt<sup>15</sup> suggests that in early times they must be looked
for west of the Indus with Divodāsa; he also mentions, though
he does not definitely adopt, the suggestion of Brunnhofer that
the Sṛñjayas are to be compared with the <lang n="greek">Σαράγγαι</lang><sup>16</sup> of the
Greeks, and to be located in Drangiana. Zimmer<sup>17</sup> is inclined
to locate them on the upper Indus; but it is difficult to decide
definitely in favour of any particular location. They may well
have been a good deal farther east than the Indus, since their
allies, the Tṛtsus, were in the {@Madhyadeśa,@} and were certainly
absorbed in the Kurus.
<div n="P"/>Of the history of this clan we have one notice.<sup>18</sup> They
expelled {@Duṣṭarītu Pauṃsāyana,@} one of their kings, from the
hereditary monarchy — of ten generations — and also drove out
{@Revottaras Pāṭava Cākra Sthapati,@} probably his minister,
who, however, succeeded in effecting the restoration of the
king, despite the opposition of the Kuru prince, {@Balhika@}
{@Prātīpya.@} Very probably this Kuru prince may have been at
the bottom of the movement which led to the expulsion of the
king and his minister. But the restoration of the king can
[Page2-471+ 46]
hardly be regarded, in accordance with Bloomfield's view,<sup>19</sup> as a
defeat of the Sṛñjayas.
