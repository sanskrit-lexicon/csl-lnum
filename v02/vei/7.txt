{@Akṣata@}¦ or {@Akṣita.@} — In one passage of the Atharvaveda,<sup>1</sup>
dealing with the {@Jāyānya,@} mention is made of a remedy for
sores designated both Akṣita and Sukṣata, or, according to
the reading of the Kauṣika Sūtra, Akṣata and Sukṣata, while
Sāyaṇa has Akṣita and Sukṣita. Bloomfield<sup>2</sup> renders ‘not
caused by cutting’ and ‘caused by cutting.’ Formerly<sup>3</sup> he
suggested ‘tumour’ or ‘boil.’ Whitney<sup>4</sup> thinks that two
varieties of Jāyānya are meant. Ludwig<sup>5</sup> reads with Sāyana
{%akṣita,%} which he renders by ‘not firmly established’ in the
invalid. Zimmer<sup>6</sup> finds in it a disease Kṣata.
