{@Pur@}¦ is a word of frequent occurrence in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and
later,<sup>2</sup> meaning ‘rampart,’ ‘fort,’ or ‘stronghold.’ Such fortifi-
cations must have been occasionally of considerable size, as
one is called ‘broad’ ({%pṛthvī%}) and ‘wide’ ({%urvī%}).<sup>3</sup> Elsewhere<sup>4</sup>
a fort ‘made of stone’ ({%aśmamayī%}) is mentioned. Sometimes
strongholds ‘of iron’ ({%āyasī%}) are referred to,<sup>5</sup> but these are
probably only metaphorical. A fort ‘full of kine’ ({%gomatī%}) is
mentioned,<sup>6</sup> showing that strongholds were used to hold cattle.
‘Autumnal’ ({%śāradī%}) forts are named, apparently as belonging
to the {@Dāsas:@} this may refer to the forts in that season being
[Page1-539+ 89]
occupied against Āryan attacks or against inundations caused
by overflowing rivers. Forts ‘with a hundred walls’ ({%śata-%}
{%bhuji%}) are spoken of.<sup>7</sup>
<div n="P"/>It would probably be a mistake to regard these forts as
permanently occupied fortified places like the fortresses of the
mediæval barony. They were probably merely places of refuge
against attack, ramparts of hardened earth with palisades and
a ditch ({%cf.%} {@Dehī@}). Pischel and Geldner,<sup>8</sup> however, think that
there were towns with wooden walls and ditches (<lang n="greek">περίβολος</lang> and
<lang n="greek">τάφρος</lang>) like the Indian town of Pāṭaliputra known to Megas-
thenes<sup>9</sup> and the Pāli texts.<sup>10</sup> This is possible, but hardly
susceptible of proof, and it is not without significance that the
word {@Nagara@} is of late occurrence. On the whole it is hardly
likely that in early Vedic times city life was much developed.
In the Epic, according to Hopkins,<sup>11</sup> there are found the
Nagara, ‘city’; {@Grāma,@} ‘village’; and Ghoṣa, ‘ranch.’ Vedic
literature hardly seems to go beyond the village, no doubt with
modifications in its later period.
<div n="P"/>The siege of forts is mentioned in the Saṃhitās and Brāh-
maṇas.<sup>12</sup> According to the Rigveda,<sup>13</sup> fire was used.

the palisade was no more than a hedge
of thorn or a row of stakes ({%cf.%} Rv.
x. 101, 8), as suggested by Zimmer,
{%Altindisches Leben,%} 143, 145; and {%cf.%}
Rv. viii. 53, 5, as corrected by Roth,
{%Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen%}
{%Gesellschaft,%} 48, 109.
<div n="P"/>{%Cf.%} Zimmer, {%Altindisches Leben,%} 142-
148, who compares the fact that neither
the Germans (Tacitus, {%Germania,%} 16)
nor the Slavs (Procopius, {%De bello Gotico,%}
iii. 14) lived in towns, but, like the
ancient Indians, were scattered in
villages, each consisting of the houses
and steadings of the several families
living in the village. The evidence
seems pretty convincing. It is true
that the Greeks, when we first find
them, evidently knew castles and for-
tresses of the mediæval type; but the
Greeks were clearly an invading race,
superimposed on an older and in
civilization more advanced people (see,
{%e.g.,%} Burrows, {%Discoveries in Crete%}). But
the Pur may, as Zimmer allows, have
sometimes been built within the limits
of the village. Whether, as he urges
(144), the {%śāradī pur%} was a protection
against the floods of autumn is un-
certain. {%Cf.%} Rv. i. 131, 4; 174, 2;
vi. 20, 10. In particular, it is not
legitimate to connect the mention of
those forts with the fact that the Pūrus
lived on either side of the Sindhu
(Indus), and to assume that Purukutsa's
attack on the aborigines was directed
against the forts in which they normally
protected themselves on the rising of
the river. No argument for the large
size of cities can be drawn from the
mention in the Kāṭhaka Upaniṣad, v. 1,
of {%ekādaśa-dvāra%} as an epithet of Pura
({%cf.%} Śvetāśvatara Upaniśad, iii. 18;
{%nava-dvāra pura,%} ‘the citadel of nine
doors’), because it is used meta-
phorically of the body, and the number
of doors depends on the nature of the
body (Keith, {%Aitareya Āraṇyaka,%} 185).
The evidence of the Śatapatha Brāh-
maṇa, xi. 1, 1, 2, 3, seems rather to
point to only one gate in a city.
