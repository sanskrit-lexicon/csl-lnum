{@Kṛtvan.@}¦ — In one passage of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> the word Kṛtvan in
the plural is mentioned with the {@Ārjīkas@} and the five peoples.
Pischel<sup>2</sup> thinks that it means a people, and Sāyaṇa expressly
says that the Kṛtvans designate a country.<sup>3</sup> The name in that
case would point to some connexion with the {@Kurus@} or {@Krivis.@}
Hillebrandt,<sup>4</sup> however, thinks that the word is an adjective
which qualifies Ārjīkas and designates this people as magicians,
being applied to them by an opponent. In favour of this view,
he quotes Hiouen Thsang's statement<sup>5</sup> that the neighbouring
kings held the base Kaśmīrians in such scorn as to refuse all
alliance with them, and to give them the name of Ki-li-to, or
Kṛtyas. He suggests that the Ārjīkas settled in Kasmīr in
ancient times already had the same evil reputation as their
successors in later days.
