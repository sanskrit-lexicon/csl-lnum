{@Tārkṣya@}¦ is mentioned in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as a divine steed,
apparently the sun conceived as a horse.<sup>2</sup> But Foy,<sup>3</sup> judging
by the name, apparently a patronymic of {@Tṛkṣi,@} who is known
from the Rigveda<sup>4</sup> onwards as a descendant of {@Trasadasyu,@}
thinks that a real steed, the property of Tṛkṣi, is meant; but
this is not very probable.<sup>5</sup> See also {@Tārukṣya.@}

<F>5) In Khila, ii. 4, 1, Tārkṣya is repre-
sented as a bird ({%vāyasa%}), also a symbol
of the sun. In the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,
xv. 18, he is mentioned with Ariṣṭanemi,
originally an epithet of his (Rv. i. 89, 6;
x. 178, 1), as a person, and in the
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 3, 13, he
appears as Vaipaśyata (Vaipaścita in
Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, x. 7), king
of the birds ({%cf.%} Eggeling, {%Sacred Books%}
