2. {@Brahman@}¦ is found in many passages of the Rigveda and
later in the sense of ‘priest.’ In many passages of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup>
he is referred to as praising the gods; in others<sup>2</sup> the sense of
‘priest’ is adequate. In not a few cases<sup>3</sup> the priesthood as a
profession is clearly alluded to, nor is there any reason to doubt<sup>4</sup>
that in all cases the word has the technical sense of a member
of the priesthood. There is, however, considerable doubt as to
the number of cases in the Rigveda, where it has the technical
[Page2-078+ 60]
sense of the priest who guides the sacrifice generally. It is
undoubtedly found in that sense, both Muir<sup>5</sup> and Roth<sup>6</sup>
recognizing instances of its being used thus. Geldner,<sup>7</sup> how-
ever, is anxious to find that sense in a large number of passages,
and insists that the {@Purohita@} was normally a Brahman in the
narrower sense. Oldenberg,<sup>8</sup> on the other hand, holds with
greater probability that in most of the passages adduced
Brahman means simply ‘priest,’ and that the Purohita, who
was essentially not a member of the ordinary body of sacri-
ficing priests ({@Ṛtvij@}), was, when he officiated at the sacrifice,
more usually the Hotṛ priest, and only later became the
Brahman. This change he regards as having taken place when
the importance of the hymns declined, and most weight was
laid on the functions of the priest who superintended the sacrifice
as a whole, and by his magic repaired the flaws in the sacrifice.<sup>9</sup>
In the later literature both senses of the word are quite
common.<sup>10</sup>
