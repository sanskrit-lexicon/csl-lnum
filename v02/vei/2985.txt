{@Viśva-karman Bhauvana@}¦ (‘descendant of Bhuvana’) is the
name of a quite mythical king. He is said in the Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa to have been consecrated by {@Kaśyapa,@} to whom he
offered the earth ({%i.e.,%} presumably a piece of land) as a sacrificial
fee; in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> he performed the Sarvamedha
(‘universal sacrifice’), and made a similar offer; in both cases
the earth refused to be given. The story seems to contain a
reference to the early dislike of gifts of land,<sup>3</sup> but it cannot be
stated with certainty that this is the meaning.
