{@Putrikā@}¦ in the later literature<sup>1</sup> has the technical sense of the
daughter of a man without sons, whom he gives in marriage on
the express terms that her son shall perform the funeral rites
for him, and be counted as his. The thing as well as the name
is recognized by Yāska in the Nirukta,<sup>2</sup> and traced to the
Rigveda.<sup>3</sup> But the passages in the Rigveda are of very
uncertain meaning,<sup>4</sup> and in all probability do not refer to this
custom at all.
