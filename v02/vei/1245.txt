{@Dakṣiṇā-praṣṭi@}¦ denotes ‘the side horse on the right.’ It
appears from two passages of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> that
there were at times four horses yoked to the chariot, the right
and the left yoke horse ({%dakṣiṇā-yugya, savyā-yugya%}) in the middle,
flanked by one on each side, the two latter of course not being
fastened to the yoke at all, but presumably by traces alongside
of the yoke horses. See {@Ratha.@}
<F>1) v. 1, 4, 9; ix. 4, 2, 11 (this passage appears to speak of three horses only,
but {%of.%} v. 4, 3, 17). {%Cf.%} also Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvi. 13, 12.</F>
