{@Kurīrin@}¦ (‘having a {@Kurīra@}’) is a word occurring in an
ambiguous passage of the Atharvaveda,<sup>1</sup> in which it may be
taken either as a noun meaning a ‘crested animal,’ perhaps as
Zimmer<sup>2</sup> suggests the ‘peacock,’ or as an epithet of the word
{@Aja,@} ‘goat,’ in which case it might mean ‘horned.’ But even
in the latter alternative a metaphorical application of the word
seems sufficient, just as in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> {@Opaśa@}
is used of the horns of cattle, and thus renders unnecessary
the adoption of Geldner's<sup>4</sup> view that the original meaning of
{@Kurīra@} is ‘horn.’
