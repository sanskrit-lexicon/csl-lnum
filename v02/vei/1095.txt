{@Takman@}¦ is a disease repeatedly mentioned in the Athar-
vaveda, but later not known under this name. It is the subject
of five hymns<sup>1</sup> of the Atharvaveda, and is often mentioned else-
where.<sup>2</sup> Weber<sup>3</sup> first identified it with ‘fever,’ and Grohmann<sup>4</sup>
showed that all the symptoms pointed to that ailment.<sup>5</sup> Refer-
ence is made to the alternate hot and shivering fits of the
patient,<sup>6</sup> to the yellow colour of the jaundice which accompanies
the fever,<sup>7</sup> and to its peculiar periodicity. The words used to
describe its varieties are {%anye-dyuḥ,%}<sup>8</sup> {%ubhaya-dyuḥ,%}<sup>9</sup> {%tṛtīyaka,%}<sup>10</sup>
{%vi-tṛtīya,%}<sup>11</sup> and {%sadaṃ-di,%}<sup>12</sup> the exact sense of most of which
terms is somewhat uncertain. It is agreed<sup>13</sup> that the first
epithet designates the fever known as {%quotidianus,%} which recurs
each day at the same hour, though the word is curious (lit.
[Page1-295+ 54]
‘on the other — {%i.e.,%} next, day’). The {%ubhaya-dyuḥ%} (‘on both
days’) variety appears to mean a disease recurring for two suc-
cessive days, the third being free; this corresponds to the {%rhythmus%}
{%quartanus complicatus.%}<sup>14</sup> But Sāyaṇa considers that it means a
fever recurring on the third day, the ‘tertian.’ The {%tṛtīyaka,%}
however, must be the ‘tertian’ fever,<sup>15</sup> though Zimmer<sup>16</sup> suggests
that it may mean a fever which is fatal at the third paroxysm.
Grohmann<sup>17</sup> regards the {%vi-tṛtīyaka%} as equivalent to the {%tertiana%}
{%duplicata,%} a common form in southern countries, in which the
fever occurs daily, but with a correspondence in point of time
or severity of attack on alternate days. Bloomfield<sup>18</sup> suggests
that it is identical with the {%ubhaya-dyuḥ%} variety. The {%sadaṃ-di%}<sup>19</sup>
type appears to be the kind later known as {%saṃtata-jvara%}
(‘continuous fever’), in which there are attacks of several days’
duration, with an interval followed by a fresh period of attack.
Fever occurred at different seasons, in the autumn ({%śārada%}), in
the hot weather ({%graiṣma%}), in the rains ({%vārṣika%}),<sup>20</sup> but was
especially prevalent in the first, as is indicated by the epithet
{%viśva-śārada,%} ‘occurring every autumn.’<sup>21</sup>
<div n="P"/>The disease is said to arise when Agni enters the waters.<sup>22</sup>
From this Weber<sup>23</sup> deduced that it was considered to be the
result of a chill supervening on heat, or the influence of heat on
marshy land. Grohmann<sup>24</sup> preferred to see in this connexion
of the origin of the disease with Agni's entering the waters<sup>25</sup>
an allusion to the fact that fever arises in the rainy season, the
time when Agni, as lightning, descends to earth with the rain.
Zimmer.<sup>26</sup> who accepts this view, further refers to the prevalence
[Page1-296+ 41]
of fever in the Terai, and interprets {%vanya,%} an epithet of fever
found in the Atharvaveda,<sup>27</sup> as meaning ‘sprung from the
forest,’ pointing out that fever is mentioned as prevalent among
the {@Mūjavants@} and {@Mahāvṛṣas,@} two mountain tribes of the
western Himālaya.<sup>28</sup> There is no trace of fever having been
observed to be caused by the bite of the {%anopheles%} mosquito,
which breeds in stagnant water: this theory has without reason
been held to be known to classical Indian medicine.<sup>29</sup>
<div n="P"/>Among the symptoms of Takman, or among complications
accompanying it, are mentioned ‘itch’ ({@Pāman@}), ‘headache’
({%śīrṣa-śoka%}),<sup>30</sup> ‘cough’ ({@Kāsikā@}), and ‘consumption,’ or perhaps
some form of itch ({@Balāsa@}).
<div n="P"/>It is perhaps significant that the Takman does not appear
until the Atharvaveda. It is quite possible that the Vedic
Āryans, when first settled in India, did not know the disease,
which would take some generations to become endemic and
recognized as dangerous. What remedies they used against it
is quite uncertain, for the Atharvaveda mentions only spells
and the {@Kuṣṭha,@} which can hardly have been an effective
remedy, though still used in later times. Fever must, even in
the Atharvan period, have claimed many victims, or it would
not be mentioned so prominently.
