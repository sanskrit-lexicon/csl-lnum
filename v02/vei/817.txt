{@Khadira@}¦ is mentioned frequently from the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> onwards<sup>2</sup>
as a tree with hard wood<sup>3</sup> — the {%Acacia catechu.%} The {@Aśvattha@}
is referred to as engrafting itself upon it in the Atharvaveda,<sup>4</sup>
[Page1-214+ 42]
and from it the climbing plant {@Arundhatī@} is said to have sprung.<sup>5</sup>
The {%sruva%} or sacrificial ladle is spoken of as having been made
from it,<sup>6</sup> no doubt because of its hardness. It is in the same
passage also said to have sprung from the sap ({%rasa%}) of the
Gāyatrī. There is no clear reference to Catechu having been
prepared from its core,<sup>7</sup> as it was later. The core ({%sāra%}) was
used for making amulets.<sup>8</sup>
