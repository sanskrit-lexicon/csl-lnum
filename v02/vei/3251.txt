{@Śāryāta,@}¦ perhaps ‘descendant of {@Śaryāta,@}’ is the name of a
singer in the Rigveda.<sup>1</sup> A Śāryāta appears also in the Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> with the patronymic {@Mānava@} as the seer of a
Rigvedic hymn,<sup>3</sup> and as having been anointed by {@Cyavana.@}<sup>4</sup>
The same man is evidently meant by Śaryāta in the story of
Cyavana in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>5</sup> and the Jaiminīya Brāh-
maṇa.<sup>6</sup> In both these passages the Śāryātas are mentioned as
his descendants, and his daughter is called Śāryātī.
