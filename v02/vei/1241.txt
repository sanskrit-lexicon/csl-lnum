{@Dakṣa Pārvati@}¦ (‘descendant of {@Parvata@}’) is mentioned in
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> as having performed a certain rite
which his descendants, the Dākṣāyaṇas, still maintained, thus
enjoying royal dignity down to the time of the Brāhmaṇa itself.
He appears in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> also.
