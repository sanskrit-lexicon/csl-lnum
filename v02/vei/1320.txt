{@Dīrgha-śravas@}¦ (‘far-famed’) is the name of a royal seer who,
according to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>1</sup> having been banished
from his kingdom, and suffering from actual hunger, ‘saw’ a
certain Sāman (chant), and thus obtained food. In one passage
of the Rigveda<sup>2</sup> an Auśija,<sup>3</sup> a merchant ({%vaṇij%}), is mentioned as
{%dīrgha-śravas,%} which may be a proper name, as Sāyaṇa holds,
or an adjective, as it is understood by Roth.<sup>4</sup>
