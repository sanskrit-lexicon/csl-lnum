{@Kūdī,@}¦ written also Kūṭī in the manuscripts, occurs in the
Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> and the Kauśika Sūtra<sup>2</sup> denoting a twig — identi-
fied by the scholiast with {@Badarī,@} the jujube — which was tied
to the bodies of the dead to efface their traces, presumably
in order to render the return of the spirit to the old home
difficult.
