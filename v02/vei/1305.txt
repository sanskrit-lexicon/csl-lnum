{@Dāsa,@}¦ like {@Dasyu,@} sometimes denotes enemies of a demoniac
character in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> but in many passages<sup>2</sup> the word
refers to human foes of the Āryans. The Dāsas are described
as having forts ({%puraḥ%}),<sup>3</sup> and their clans ({%viśaḥ%}) are mentioned.<sup>4</sup>
It is possible that the forts, which are called ‘autumnal’
({%śaradīḥ%}),<sup>5</sup> may be mythical, but it is not essential, for the
epithet may allude to their being resorted to in the autumn
season. The Dāsa colour ({@Varṇa@})<sup>6</sup> is probably an allusion to
the black skin of the aborigines, which is also directly men-
tioned.<sup>7</sup> The aborigines (as Dasyus) are called {%anās,%} ‘nose-
less’(?),<sup>8</sup> and {%mṛdhra-vāc,%} ‘of hostile speech,’<sup>9</sup> and are probably
meant by the phallus-worshippers ({%śiśna-devāḥ,%} ‘whose deity
is a phallus’) of the Rigveda.<sup>10</sup> It is significant that constant
[Page1-357+ 67]
reference is made to the differences in religion between Ārva
and Dāsa or Dasyu.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>Since the Dāsas were in many cases reduced to slavery, the
word Dāsa has the sense of ‘slave’ in several passages of the
Rigveda.<sup>12</sup> Dāsī, the feminine, always has this sense from
the Atharvaveda<sup>13</sup> onwards. Aboriginal women were, no doubt,
the usual slaves, for on their husbands being slain in battle
they would naturally have been taken as servants. They would
sometimes also become concubines; thus {@Kavaṣa@} was taunted
with being the son of a female slave ({%dāsyāḥ putraḥ%}) in the
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>14</sup>
<div n="P"/>Ludwig<sup>15</sup> considers that in some passages<sup>16</sup> Dāsa is applied,
in the sense of ‘enemy,’ to Āryan foes, but this is uncertain.
Zimmer<sup>17</sup> and Meyer<sup>18</sup> think that Dāsa<sup>19</sup> originally meant
‘enemy’ in general, later developing in Iran into the name of
the Dahae<sup>20</sup> of the Caspian steppes, and in India into a desig-
nation of the aborigines. On the other hand, Hillebrandt<sup>21</sup>
argues that, as the Dāsas and the Paṇis are mentioned together,<sup>22</sup>
they must be deemed to be closely related tribes, identifying
[Page1-358+ 51]
the Paṇis with the Parnians and the Dāsas of the Rigveda
with the Dahae. This view, of course, necessitates a transfer
of the scenes of the Rigveda, where Dāsas are prominent, and
especially those in which Divodāsa — ‘the heavenly Dāsa’ — plays
an important part,<sup>23</sup> to the far west. Hillebrandt justifies this
by regarding the scene of the sixth book of the Rigveda as
quite different from that of the seventh and third, in which
Sudās, the Bharatas, Vasiṣṭha, and Viśvāmitra appear. The
Sarasvatī of the sixth book he locates in Arachosia, that of the
seventh in the ‘Middle Country.’ It is, however, extremely
doubtful whether this theory can be upheld. That Divodāsa
should have been a Dāsa, and yet have fought against other
Dāsas, is not in itself likely, especially when his son Sudās
appears as a protagonist of Āryan civilization. It also seems
unreasonable to seek in Arachosia for the river {@Sarasvati,@}
which it is natural to locate in the ‘Middle Country.’
<div n="P"/>The wealth of the Dāsas was no doubt considerable,<sup>24</sup> but in
civilization there is no reason to suppose that they were ever
equal to the invaders.<sup>25</sup> Leading Dāsas were {@Ilībiśa, Cumuri@}
and {@Dhuni, Pipru, Varcin, Śambara.@} For names of aboriginal
tribes, see {@Kirāta, Kīkaṭa, Caṇḍāla, Parṇaka, Śiṃyu.@}

The Ārya colour is mentioned in iii. 34,
9, and the Dāsa is contrasted with the
Varṇa (of the singers) in i. 104, 2. The
‘white-hued ({%śvitnya%}) friends’ who, in
i. 100, 18, aid in the conquest of the
Dasyu and Siṃyu are doubtless Āryans.
In the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 30,
the day and night ({%ahorātre%}) are
paralleled with the Śūdrāryau — that is,
probably with the Āryan and Śūdra
(the compound is not to be taken as
giving the words in the correct order;

Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, {%s.v.,%} 2,
suggests that in viii. 46, 32, the word
{%dāsān,%} ‘slaves,’ should be read in place
of {%dāse,%} qualifying {@Balbūtha.@} Zimmer,
{%Altindisches Leben,%} 117, quotes the passage
to indicate the admixture of Āryan and
Dāsa blood. See also Av. iv. 9, 8;
Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vii. 24, 2. It is
uncertain whether {%dāsa-pravarga,%} as an
epithet of {%rayi,%} ‘wealth,’ in Rv. i. 92, 8,
means ‘consisting of troops of slaves.’
Geldner, {%Rigveda, Glossar,%} 82, so takes

allied in race and language with the

proved. {%Cf.%} E. Kuhn in Kuhn's {%Zeit-%}

that Dāsa occurs only four times in
Maṇḍala vii., but eight times in vi.,
and that similarly Śambara, the Dāsa,
is mentioned six times in vi., but only
twice in vii. But Divodāsa much more
probably means, as Oldenberg in-
terprets the name, ‘the servant of
heaven.’ See his {%Religion des Veda,%} 155,
