{@Tṛtsu@}¦ occurs in the Rigveda, once in the singular<sup>1</sup> and several
times in the plural,<sup>2</sup> as a proper name. The Tṛtsus were
clearly helpers of {@Sudās@} in the great battle against the ten
kings, {@Śimyu,@} the {@Turvaśa,@} the {@Druhyu, Kavaṣa,@} the {@Pūru,@}
the {@Anu, Bheda, Śambara,@} the two {@Vaikarṇas,@} and perhaps
the {@Yadu,@} who led with them as allies<sup>3</sup> the {@Matsyas, Pakthas,@}
{@Bhalānas, Alinas, Viṣāṇins, Śivas, Ajas, Śigrus,@} and perhaps
Yakṣus.<sup>4</sup> The defeat of the ten kings is celebrated in one
[Page1-321+ 56]
hymn of the Rigveda,<sup>5</sup> and is evidently alluded to in two
others.<sup>6</sup> The great battle took place on the {@Paruṣṇī,@} but there
was also a fight on the {@Yamunā@} with Bheda, the Ajas, Śigrus,
and Yakṣus. As the Yamunā and the Parusṇī represent
opposite ends of the territory of the Tṛtsus (for we cannot
with Hopkins<sup>7</sup> safely identify the streams), it is difficult to see
exactly how the ten kings could be confederated, but it should
be noted that the references to the ten kings occur in the two
later hymns,<sup>6</sup> and not in the hymn<sup>5</sup> describing the battle itself;
besides, absolute numerical accuracy cannot be insisted upon.
<div n="P"/>It is difficult exactly to determine the character of the
Tṛtsus; especially in their relation to the Bharatas, who under
Viśvāmitra's guidance are represented as prospering and as
advancing to the {@Vipāś@} and {@Śutudrī.@}<sup>8</sup> Roth ingeniously
brought this into connexion with the defeat of his enemies
by Sudās, which is celebrated in the seventh book of the
Rigveda — a book attributed to the Vasiṣṭha family — and thought
that there was a reference in one verse<sup>9</sup> to the defeat of the
Bharatas by Sudās. But it seems certain that the verse is
mistranslated, and that the Bharatas are really represented as
victors with Sudās.<sup>10</sup> Ludwig<sup>11</sup> accordingly identifies the
Tṛtsus and the Bharatas. Oldenberg,<sup>12</sup> after accepting this
view at first,<sup>13</sup> later expressed the opinion that the Tṛtsus were
the priests of the Bharata people, and therefore identical with
the Vasiṣṭhas. This view is supported by the fact that in one
passage<sup>14</sup> the Tṛtsus are clearly described as wearing their
hair in the peculiar manner affected by the Vasiṣṭhas,<sup>15</sup> and
would in that passage thus seem to represent the Vasiṣṭhas.
[Page1-322+ 59]
But Geldner<sup>16</sup> has suggested with great probability that Tṛtsu,
who is once mentioned in the singular,<sup>17</sup> means the Tṛtsu
king — that is, Sudās.<sup>18</sup> This explanation alone justifies the
description<sup>19</sup> of the Bharatas as {%Tṛtsūnāṃ viśaḥ,%}<sup>20</sup> ‘subjects of
the Tṛtsus,’ meaning the Tṛtsu Gotra or family, for the people
could not be said to be subjects of a body of priests. The
Vasiṣṭhas might be called Tṛtsus because of their close con-
nexion with the royal house of that people. The reverse
process is also quite possible, but is rendered improbable by
the fact that the {@Pratṛdaḥ@} are referred to as receiving Vasiṣṭha.<sup>21</sup>
This name of the Tṛtsu dynasty is probably older than its
connexion with Vasiṣṭha in the time of Sudās, a conclusion
supported by the name of {@Pratardana,@} who is mentioned later
as a descendant of Divodāsa,<sup>22</sup> an ancestor of Sudās. The
Tṛtsu dynasty could therefore hardly have been referred to as
Vasiṣṭhas. For the further history of the dynasty and its
relation with Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra, see {@Sudās.@}
<div n="P"/>If the Tṛtsus and their subjects, the Bharatas, were in the
Rigvedic period at war with the tribes on either side of the
territory between the Paruṣṇī and the Yamunā, it is clear<sup>23</sup>
that later on they coalesced with the Pūrus and probably
others of those tribes to form the {@Kuru@} people. Already in
the Rigveda<sup>24</sup> the Tṛtsus are allied with the {@Sṛñjayas,@} and in
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>25</sup> one Purohita serves both Kurus
and Sṛñjayas.
[Page1-323+ 50]
<div n="P"/>Hillebrandt<sup>26</sup> considers that the Tṛtsus cannot be identified
with the Bharatas, but that Sudās and the Bharatas represent
an invading body, which, however, became allied with the
Tṛtsus and the Vasiṣṭha priests. He also thinks that the
Rigveda reveals a time when {@Divodāsa,@} the grandfather or
ancestor of Sudās, was living in Arachosia, on the {@Sarasvatī,@}
and warring against the {@Paṇis,@} whom he identifies with the
Parnians. But this conjecture<sup>27</sup> cannot be regarded as
probable. In the Sarasvatī<sup>28</sup> it is not necessary to see any
other river than the later Sarasvatī, in the middle country,
which flowed within the boundaries of the Tṛtsus: it is also
significant that there are references<sup>29</sup> to contests between
{@Turvaśa Yadu@} and Atithigva or Divodāsa. Thus there is no
reason to doubt that Divodāsa and the Bharatas were in the
middle country, and not in Iran.

<F>3) They were regarded as enemies of
the kings by Roth, {%Zur Litteratur und%}
{%Geschichte des Weda,%} 95, and by Zimmer,
{%op. cit.,%} 126, The latter, however,
altered his view (see pp. 430, 431,
which Hopkins, {%op. cit.,%} 260, has over-
looked), and there is no doubt that
the later opinion is correct. {%Cf.%} also
Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda,
3, 173; Hopkins, 260, 261. Of these
tribes the Pakthas, Alinas, Bhalānas,
Viṣāṇins, and Śivas, were probably
settled in the north-west, to the west
of the Indus, and around the Kabul
River. The Anus, Pūrus, Turvaśas,
Yadus, and Druhyus, were probably
tribes of the Panjab; the Ajas, Śigrus,
and Yakṣus, tribes of the east, under
Bheda; Śambara may also have been
a native of the east; Śimyu and Kavaṣa
are doubtful; and the Vaikarṇau prob-
ably belonged to the north-west.</F>
<F>4) This is uncertain; the text of the
Rigveda, vii. 18, 6, has Yakṣu, and
the same word recurs in verse 19. On
the other hand, the word Yadu would
naturally be expected in verse 6, as Tur-
vaśa is mentioned. Zimmer, {%Altindisches%}
{%Leben,%} 122, says that Yadu occurs in
vii. 18, but on p. 126 he cites Yakṣu
in both places, evidently by oversight.
Hopkins, {%Journal of the American Oriental%}
{%Society,%} 15, 261, n., considers that Tur-
vaśa, the Yakṣu, is a sarcastic expres-
sion, instead of Turvaśa, the Yadu,
making Turvaśa, whom he regards as
king of the Yadus, ridiculous as a
member of an insignificant people, and
alluding to him also as a sacrificial
victim (as it were, {%yaṣṭavya,%} ‘to be
offered’; {%of puroḍāś,%} ‘cake of sacrifice,’
in verse 6, as a pun on {%purogās,%} ‘leader’).
Whether Yakṣu is used contemptuously
for Yadu or not, it seems hard not to
believe that the Yadus are referred
to.</F>
