{@Kaparda,@}¦ ‘braid,’ {@Kapardin,@} ‘wearing braids.’ These words
refer to the Vedic custom of wearing the hair in braids or
plaits. Thus a maiden is said to have her hair in four plaits
({%catuṣ-kapardā%}),<sup>1</sup> and the goddess Sinīvālī is described as ‘wear-
ing fair braids’ ({%su-kapardā%}).<sup>2</sup> Men also wore their hair in this
style, for both Rudra<sup>3</sup> and Pūṣan<sup>4</sup> are said to have done so,
while the {@Vasiṣṭhas@}<sup>5</sup> were distinguished by wearing their hair
in a plait on the right ({%dakṣiṇatas-kaparda%}). The opposite was
to wear one's hair ‘plain’ ({%pulasti%}).<sup>6</sup> See also {@Opaśa.@}
