{@Ṛtv-ij@}¦ is the regular term for ‘sacrificial priest,’ covering all
the different kinds of priests employed at the sacrifice. It
appears certain that all the priests were Brāhmaṇas.<sup>1</sup> The
number of priests officiating at a sacrifice with different functions
was almost certainly seven. The oldest list, occurring in one
passage of the Rigveda,<sup>2</sup> enumerates their names as Hotṛ, Potṛ,
Neṣṭṛ, Agnīdh, Praśāstṛ, Adhvaryu, Brahman, besides the
institutor of the sacrifice. The number of seven probably
explains the phrase ‘seven Hotṛs’ occurring so frequently in
the Rigveda, and is most likely connected with that of the
mythical ‘seven Ṛṣis.’ It may be compared with the eight of
Iran.<sup>3</sup> The chief of the seven priests was the Hotṛ, who was
the singer of the hymns, and in the early times their composer
also. The Adhvaryu performed the practical work of the
sacrifice, and accompanied his performance with muttered
formulas of prayer and deprecation of evil. His chief assist-
ance was derived from the Agnīdh, the two performing the
smaller sacrifices without other help in practical matters. The
Praśāstṛ, Upavaktṛ, or Maitrāvaruṇa, as he was variously
called, appeared only in the greater sacrifices as giving in-
structions to the Hotṛ, and as entrusted with certain litanies.
The Potṛ, Neṣṭṛ, and Brahman belonged to the ritual of the
Soma sacrifice, the latter being later styled Brāhmaṇāc-
chaṃsin to distinguish him from the priest who in the later
[Page1-113+ 60]
ritual acted as supervisor. Other priests referred to in the
Rigveda<sup>4</sup> are the singers of Sāmans or chants, the Udgātṛ
and his assistant the Prastotṛ, while the Pratihartṛ, another
assistant, though not mentioned, may quite well have been
known. Their functions undoubtedly represent a later stage
of the ritual, the development of the elaborate series of
sacrificial calls on the one hand, and on the other the use
of long hymns addressed to the Soma plant. Other priests,
such as the Achāvāka,<sup>5</sup> the Grāvastut, the Unnetṛ, and the
Subrahmaṇya, were known later in the developed ritual of the
Brāhmaṇas, making in all sixteen priests, who were technically
and artificially classed in four groups<sup>6</sup> Hotṛ, Maitrāvaruṇa,
Achāvāka, and Grāvastut; Udgātṛ, Prastotṛ, Pratihartṛ, and
Subrahmaṇya; Adhvaryu, Pratisthātṛ, Neṣṭṛ, and Unnetṛ;
Brahman, Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin, Agnīdhra, and Petṛ.
<div n="P"/>Apart from all these priests was the {@Purohita,@} who was
the spiritual adviser of the king in all his religious duties.
Geldner<sup>7</sup> holds that, as a rule, when the Purohita actually
took part in one of the great sacrifices he played the part of
the Brahman, in the sense of the priest who superintended the
whole conduct of the ritual. He sees evidence for this view in
a considerable number of passages of the Rigveda<sup>8</sup> and the
later literature,<sup>9</sup> where Purohita and Brahman were combined
or identified. Oldenberg,<sup>10</sup> however, more correctly points out
[Page1-114+ 49]
that in the earlier period this was not the case: the Purohita
was then normally the Hotṛ, the singer of the most important
of the songs; it was only later that the Brahman, who in the
capacity of overseer of the rite is not known to the Rigveda,
acquired the function of general supervision hitherto exercised
by the Purohita, who was {%ex officio%} skilled in the use of magic
and in guarding the king by spells which could also be applied
to guarding the sacrifice from evil demons. With this agrees
the fact that Agni, pre-eminently<sup>11</sup> the Purohita of men, is also
a Hotṛ, and that the two divine Hotṛs of the Āprī hymns are
called<sup>12</sup> the divine Purohitas. On the other hand, the rule
is explicitly recognized in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>13</sup> that a
Kṣatriya should have a Brahman as a Purohita; and in
the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>14</sup> the Vasiṣṭha family have a special
claim to the office of Brahman-Purohita, perhaps an indi-
cation that it was they who first as Purohitas exchanged the
function of Hotṛs for that of Brahmans in the sacrificial
ritual.
<div n="P"/>The sacrifices were performed for an individual in the great
majority of cases. The Sattra,<sup>15</sup> or prolonged sacrificial session,
was, however, performed for the common benefit of the priests
taking part in it, though its advantageous results could only be
secured if all the members actually engaged were consecrated
({%dīkṣita%}). Sacrifices for a people as such were unknown. The
sacrifice for the king was, it is true, intended to bring about
the prosperity of his people also; but it is characteristic that
the prayer<sup>16</sup> for welfare includes by name only the priest and
the king, referring to the people indirectly in connexion with
the prosperity of their cattle and agriculture.
<F>1) This is assumed throughout the
Vedic texts, and is accompanied by
the rule that no Kṣatriya can eat of
the sacrificial offering ({%Cf.%} Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa, vii. 26): no doubt because
only the Brāhmaṇas were sufficiently
holy to receive the divine essence of
the sacrifice into which, by partaking
of it, the deity has entered in part.</F>
