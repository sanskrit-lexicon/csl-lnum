{@Paśu@}¦ means ‘animal’ generally, including man. There is
frequent mention<sup>1</sup> of the five sacrificial animals — the horse, the
cow, the sheep, the goat, and man. Seven such domestic
animals are spoken of in the Atharvaveda<sup>2</sup> and later;<sup>3</sup> probably,
as Whitney<sup>4</sup> observes, merely as a sacred mystic number, not,
as the commentator<sup>5</sup> explains, the usual five with the ass and
the camel added. Animals are also referred to as {%ubhayadant%}
[Page1-510+ 63]
and {%anyatodant.%} They are further<sup>6</sup> classified as those which
take hold with the hand ({%hastādānāḥ%}), man ({%puruṣa%}), elephant
({%hastin%}), and ape ({%markaṭa%}), and those which grasp by the mouth
({%mukhādānāḥ%}). Another division is that of biped ({%dvipād%}) and
quadruped ({%catuṣpād%}).<sup>7</sup> Man is a biped;<sup>8</sup> he is the first ({%pra-%}
{%thama%}) of the beasts;<sup>9</sup> he alone of animals lives a hundred
years ({%śatāyus%}),<sup>10</sup> and he is king of the animals.<sup>11</sup> He possesses
speech ({%vāc%}) in conjunction with the other animals.<sup>12</sup> In the
Aitareya Āraṇyaka<sup>13</sup> an elaborate distinction is drawn between
vegetables, animals, and man in point of intellect.
<div n="P"/>Of animals apart from man a threefold division is offered in
the Rigveda<sup>14</sup> — into those of the air ({%vāyavya%}), those of the
jungle ({%āraṇya%}), and those of the village ({%grāmya%}), or tame
animals. The division into {%āraṇya%} and {%grāmya%} animals is quite
common.<sup>15</sup> In the Yajurveda Saṃhitās<sup>16</sup> is found a division
into {%eka-śapha,%} ‘whole-hoofed’; {%kṣudra,%} ‘small’; and {%āraṇya,%}
‘wild,’ the two former classes denoting the tame animals.<sup>16</sup>
The horse and the ass are {%eka-śapha;%}<sup>17</sup> the {%kṣudra%} are the sheep,
the goat, and the ox: this distinction being parallel to that of
{%ubhayadant%} and {%anyatodant.%}<sup>18</sup> Zimmer<sup>19</sup> sees in a passage of the
Atharvaveda<sup>20</sup> a division of wild animals ({%āraṇya%}) into five
classes: (1) those of the jungle described as the ‘dread beasts
[Page1-511+ 43]
which are in the wood’ ({%mṛgā bhīmā vane hitāḥ%}); (2) winged
creatures, represented by the {@Haṃsa,@} ‘gander,’ {@Suparṇa,@}
‘eagle,’ {@Śakuna,@} ‘bird’; (3) amphibia — {@Śiṃśumāra,@} ‘alligator,’
and {@Ajagara,@} ‘crocodile’ (?); (4) ‘fish,’ {@Purīkaya, Jaṣa,@}
and {@Matsya;@} (5) insects and worms (described as {%rajasāḥ%}).
But this division is more ingenious than probable, and it is
ignored by both Bloomfield<sup>21</sup> and Whitney.<sup>22</sup>
