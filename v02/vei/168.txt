{@Avi.@}¦ — ‘Sheep’ are repeatedly mentioned in the Rigveda, and
later, often in conjunction with goats ({%aja%}). The wolf ({%vṛka%})
was their great enemy,<sup>1</sup> and they were tended by shepherds.<sup>2</sup>
[Page1-041+ 52]
Sheep as well as kine were captured from the enemy.<sup>3</sup> The
Soma sieve was made of sheep's wool, and is repeatedly
referred to ({%avi, meṣī, avya, avyaya%}).<sup>4</sup> Considerable herds
must have existed, as Ṛjrāśva is said<sup>5</sup> to have slain one
hundred rams, and in a Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’)<sup>6</sup> a hundred
sheep are mentioned as a gift. The ({%meṣa,%}<sup>7</sup> {%vṛṣṇi%}<sup>8</sup> ) ram was
sometimes castrated ({%petva%}).<sup>9</sup> The main use of sheep was their
wool; hence the expression ‘woolly’ ({%ūrṇāvatī%})<sup>10</sup> is employed to
designate a sheep. In the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>11</sup> the ram is
described as ‘woolly,’ and as ‘the skin of beasts, quadruped and
biped,’ with reference to the use of its wool as clothing for men
and shelter for animals. Pūṣan is said<sup>12</sup> to weave raiment from
the wool of sheep. Normally the sheep stayed out at pasture;
in an obscure passage of the Rigveda<sup>13</sup> reference appears to be
made to rams in stall. Gandhāra<sup>14</sup> ewes were famous for their
wool. Pischel<sup>15</sup> considers that the {@Paruṣṇī@}<sup>16</sup> was named from
its richness in sheep, {%parus%}<sup>17</sup> denoting the ‘flocks’ of wool.
