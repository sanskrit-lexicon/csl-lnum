{@Vṛṣaṇ-aśva@}¦ is the name of a man referred to in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup>
where Indra is called {@Menā,@} perhaps his ‘wife’ or ‘daughter.’
The same legend is alluded to in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>2</sup>
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>3</sup> the Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>4</sup> and the
Taittirīya Āraṇyaka,<sup>5</sup> but it is clear that all of these texts had
no real tradition of what was referred to.
