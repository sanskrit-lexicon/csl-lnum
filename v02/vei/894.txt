{@Gotama@}¦ is mentioned several times in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> but
never in such a way as to denote personal authorship of any
hymn.<sup>2</sup> It seems clear that he was closely connected with the
[Page1-235+ 60]
Aṅgirases, for the Gotamas frequently refer to {@Aṅgiras.@}<sup>3</sup> That
he bore the patronymic Rāhūgaṇa is rendered probable by one
hymn of the Rigveda,<sup>4</sup> and is assumed in the Śatapatha Brāh-
maṇa,<sup>5</sup> where he appears as the Purohita, or domestic priest, of
{@Māthava Videgha,@} and as a bearer of Vedic civilization. He
is also mentioned in the same Brāhmaṇa<sup>6</sup> as a contemporary of
{@Janaka@} of {@Videha,@} and {@Yājñavalkya,@} and as the author of
a Stoma.<sup>7</sup> He occurs, moreover, in two passages of the
Atharvaveda.<sup>8</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Gotamas are mentioned in several passages of the
Rigveda,<sup>9</sup> {@Vāmadeva@} and {@Nodhas@} being specified as sons of
Gotama. They include the {@Vājaśravases.@} See also {@Gautama.@}
