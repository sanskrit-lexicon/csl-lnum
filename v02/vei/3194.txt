{@Śaryaṇāvant@}¦ occurs in several passages of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> in
all of which Sāyaṇa sees a local name. According to his
account, Śaryaṇāḥ (masc. plur.) is a district in {@Kurukṣetra,@}
Śaryaṇāvant being a lake not far from it in the back part
({%jaghanārdhe%}) of Kurukṣetra. The unusual consistency of his
statements on this point is in favour of the word being a place
name; it is also to be noted that Kurukṣetra contained the
lake {@Anyataḥplakṣā.@} Roth,<sup>2</sup> however, thought that in two
passages<sup>3</sup> the word denoted merely a ‘lake,’ literally ‘(water)
covered with a thicket of reeds’ ({%śaryaṇa%}), and in the others a
Soma vessel. Zimmer<sup>4</sup> inclines to this rendering. On the
other hand, Pischel<sup>5</sup> accepts Sāyaṇa's view. Hillebrandt<sup>6</sup> also
sees in the word a place name, but he is inclined to locate it
among the ‘five tribes,’<sup>7</sup> which is not quite inconsistent with its
being in Kurukṣetra, for the connexion of the {@Pūrus@} with the
later {@Kurus@} is known;<sup>8</sup> or perhaps, he suggests, Śaryaṇāvant
is an old name for the Wular sea of Kaśmīr, which was only a
reminiscence in Vedic times. This is not probable; still less
so is Ludwig's hypothesis<sup>9</sup> that the Śaryaṇāvant is the later
eastern {@Sarasvatī.@} Bergaigne<sup>10</sup> regards the name as that of
a celestial preparer of Soma.
