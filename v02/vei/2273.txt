{@Bhiṣaj,@}¦ ‘physician,’ is a word of common occurrence in the
Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later.<sup>2</sup> There is no trace whatever in the former
text of the profession being held in disrepute: the Aśvins,<sup>3</sup>
Varuṇa,<sup>4</sup> and Rudra<sup>5</sup> are all called physicians. On the other
hand, in the Dharma literature<sup>6</sup> this profession is utterly
[Page2-105+ 54]
despised. This dislike is found as early as the Yajurveda
Saṃhitās,<sup>7</sup> where the Aśvins are condemned because of their
having to do with the practice of medicine ({%bheṣaja%}), on the
ground that it brings them too much among men, an allusion
to the caste dislike of promiscuous contact.
<div n="P"/>The Rigveda<sup>8</sup> contains a hymn in which a physician cele-
brates his plants and their healing powers. Moreover, wonder-
ful cures are referred to as performed by the Aśvins: the
healing of the lame<sup>9</sup> and of the blind;<sup>10</sup> the rejuvenation of the
aged {@Cyavana@}<sup>11</sup> and of {@Puraṃdhi's@} husband;<sup>12</sup> the giving of an
iron leg ({%jaṅghā āyasī%}) to {@Viśpalā,@}<sup>13</sup> a deed only more wonderful
if we assume that Viśpalā was a mare, as has been suggested by
Pischel.<sup>14</sup> It would in all probability be a mistake to assume<sup>15</sup>
that the Vedic Indians had any surgical skill: they no doubt
applied simples to wounds,<sup>16</sup> but both their medicine and their
surgery must have been most primitive. All that the Atharva-
veda shows in regard to medicine is the use of herbs combined
with spells,<sup>17</sup> and of water ({%cf.%} {@Jalāṣa@}), remedies Indo-European
in character, but not of much scientific value. On the other
hand, the knowledge of anatomy shown (see {@Śarīra@}), though
betraying grave inaccuracies, is not altogether insignificant;
but that was due no doubt mainly to the practice of dissecting
animals at the sacrifice.
<div n="P"/>There is some evidence in the Rigveda<sup>18</sup> that the practice of
medicine was already a profession; this is supported by the
inclusion of a physician in the list of victims at the Puruṣa-
medha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda.<sup>19</sup> According to
[Page2-106+ 48]
Bloomfield,<sup>20</sup> a hymn of the Atharvaveda<sup>21</sup> contains a physician's
deprecation of the use of home-made remedies instead of
reliance on his professional training.
