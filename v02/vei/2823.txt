1. {@Varṇa,@}¦ ‘colour,’ is a common word in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and
later.<sup>2</sup> A large number of colours are enumerated in Vedic
literature, but it is not possible to deduce any clear information
as to the accuracy with which the Vedic Indian distinguished
colours, or as to the principle on which his distinctions were based.
The Rigveda seems to show that red or yellow colours were
the most noticed, but this may be accidental.<sup>3</sup> ‘Black’ or
‘dark’ is denoted by {%kṛṣṇa,%} ‘white’ or ‘light-coloured’ by {%śukla%}
or {%śveta.%} ‘Black’ seems to be meant in one passage of the
Rigveda<sup>4</sup> by {%śyenī%} also. ‘Dark-grey’ or ‘dusky’ is expressed
by {%śyāma.%}<sup>5</sup> The sense of {%nīla%}<sup>6</sup> is doubtful, perhaps ‘dark-blue,’
‘bluish-black.’ The series of words {%hari, hariṇa, harit, harita,%}
seems, on the whole, to denote ‘yellow,’ but ‘green’ is also a
possible rendering, since the epithet is used of the frog.<sup>7</sup>
‘Brown’ is certainly the meaning of {%babhru,%} which is used of
the {@Vibhītaka@} nut (see {@Akṣa@}). ‘Reddish-brown’ seems to be
the tinge implied by {%kapila%}<sup>8</sup> (‘monkey-coloured’), while {%piṅgala%}
appears to denote a shade of brown in which yellow pre-
[Page2-247+ 66]
dominates, ‘tawny.’<sup>9</sup> ‘Yellow’ is expressed by {%pīta%} as well as
{%pāṇḍu.%}<sup>10</sup> A garment of saffron ({%māhārajana%}) is mentioned in the
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad.<sup>11</sup> {%Rudhira%} and {%lohita%} are red, while
{%aruṇa%} is ‘ruddy.’ {%Kalmāṣa%} means ‘spotted,’<sup>12</sup> and {%śilpa%}
‘dappled,’<sup>13</sup> while mingled shades like {%aruṇa-piśaṅga,%} ‘reddish
brown,’ also occur.<sup>14</sup>

language {%nīla%} describes the colour of
dark blue objects, such as indigo,
sapphire, etc. That the word already
had some such sense in the Rigveda is
suggested by its use in allusions to the
smoke of Agni.</F>
