{@Pañcāla@}¦ is the later name<sup>1</sup> of the people called {@Krivi@} in the
Rigveda. The Pañcālas are rarely referred to except in con-
nexion with the {@Kurus,@} and the kings of the Kuru-Pañcālas
are mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>2</sup> In the Kāṭhaka
Saṃhitā<sup>3</sup> the Pañcālas appear as the people of {@Keśin Dālbhya.@}
[Page1-469+ 46]
In the Upaniṣads and later<sup>4</sup> the Brahmins of the Pañcālas
figure as taking part in philosophical and philological dis-
cussions. The Saṃhitopaniṣad Brāhmaṇa<sup>5</sup> makes mention of
the Prācya-Pañcālas.
<div n="P"/>The Pañcālas, no doubt, included other tribes besides the
Krivis. The name seems to refer to five tribes, and it has
been suggested<sup>6</sup> that the Pañcālas represent the five tribes of
the Rigveda, but the suggestion is not very probable. There
is no trace in Vedic literature of the Epic division of the
Pañcālas into northern ({%uttara%}) and southern ({%dakṣiṇa%}). The
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>7</sup> mentions their town {@Paricakrā;@} other
towns to which allusion seems to be made were {@Kāmpīla@} and
kauśāmbī.<sup>8</sup> Of their kings and chiefs, as distinguished from
kings of the Kuru-Pañcālas, we hear of {@Kraivya, Durmukha,@}
{@Pravāhaṇa Jaivali,@} and {@Śona.@}
