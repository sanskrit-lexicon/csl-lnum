{@Dant, Danta,@}¦ ‘tooth,’ is frequently mentioned from the
Rigveda onwards.<sup>1</sup> Cleansing ({%dhāv%}) the teeth was an ordinary
act, especially in preparation for a sacrifice, and accompanied
bathing, shaving of the hair and beard ({%keśa-śmaśru%}), and the
cutting of the nails.<sup>2</sup> A hymn of the Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> celebrates
the appearance of the first two teeth of a child, though its
exact interpretation is doubtful.<sup>4</sup> In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>5</sup>
there is a reference to a child's first teeth falling out. The
word seems in the Rigveda<sup>6</sup> once to denote an elephant's tusk.
Whether dentistry was practised is doubtful. The occurrence
in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka<sup>7</sup> of {@Hiraṇya-dant,@} ‘gold-toothed,’ as
the name of a man, is perhaps significant, especially as it is
certain that the stopping of teeth with gold was known at
Rome as early as the legislation of the Twelve Tables.<sup>8</sup>
