{@Yamunā,@}¦ ‘twin,’ the name of a river, so called as running
parallel with the Ganges, is mentioned thrice in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup>
and not rarely later. According to the Rigveda,<sup>2</sup> the {@Tṛtsus@} and
{@Sudās@} won a great victory against their foes on the Yamunā;
there is no reason<sup>3</sup> whatever to accept Hopkins'<sup>4</sup> view that the
Yamunā here was another name of the {@Paruṣṇī@} (Ravi). In the
Atharvaveda<sup>5</sup> the salve ({@Āñjana@}) of the Yamunā ({%Yāmuna%}) is
mentioned along with that of {@Trikakud@} ({%Traikakuda%}) as of value.
In the Aitareya<sup>6</sup> and the Śatapatha<sup>7</sup> Brāhmaṇas the {@Bharatas@}
are famed as victorious on the Yamunā. Other Brāhmaṇas<sup>8</sup>
[Page2-187+ 62]
also mention this river. In the Mantrapāṭha<sup>9</sup> the {@Sālvas@} are
spoken of as dwelling on its banks.
