{@Śyāmāka@}¦ is the name of a cultivated millet ({%Panicum frumen-%}
{%taceum%}) in the later Saṃhitās<sup>1</sup> and the Brāhmaṇas.<sup>2</sup> The
lightness of its seed is alluded to in the Atharvaveda,<sup>3</sup> where it
is spoken of as blown away by the wind. There it is also
mentioned as the food of pigeons.<sup>4</sup> The Śyāmāka and its seed
({@Taṇḍula@}) are referred to as very small in the Chāndogya
Upaniṣad,<sup>5</sup> where Max Müller<sup>6</sup> renders it as ‘canary seed.’
