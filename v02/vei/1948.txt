{@Potṛ@}¦ is the name of one of the priests ({@Ṛtvij@}) of the sacri-
ficial ritual. Already known to the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> he is frequently
mentioned later in the Brāhmaṇas.<sup>2</sup> But as Oldenberg<sup>3</sup>
observes, the Potṛ is not in the later literature a priest of any
importance, but is practically a mere name. Judging by the
derivation of the name from the root {%pū,%} ‘purify,’ it would
seem that he was properly engaged in the purification of the
{%Soma pavamāna,%} ‘Soma purifying itself,’ and was perhaps
employed to sing hymns to this Soma. Potra<sup>4</sup> denotes both
the office and the Soma vessel of the Potṛ.<sup>5</sup>
