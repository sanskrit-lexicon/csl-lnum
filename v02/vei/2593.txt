2. {@Yuga@}¦ in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> frequently denotes a ‘generation’;
but the expression {%daśame yuge%} applied to {@Dīrghatamas@} in one
passage<sup>2</sup> must mean ‘tenth decade’ of life.
<div n="P"/>There is no reference in the older Vedic texts to the five-year
cycle (see {@Saṃvatsara@}). The quotation from the Pañcaviṃśa
Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> given in the St. Petersburg Dictionary, and by
Zimmer<sup>4</sup> and others, is merely a citation from a modern text
in the commentary on that work.
<div n="P"/>Nor do the older Vedic texts know of any series of Yugas or
ages such as are usual later. In the Atharvaveda<sup>5</sup> there are
mentioned in order a hundred years, an {%ayuta%} (10,000?), and
then two, three, or four Yugas: the inference from this seems
to be that a Yuga means more than an {%ayuta,%} but is not very
[Page2-193+ 67]
certain. Zimmer<sup>6</sup> adduces a passage from the Rigveda,<sup>7</sup>
but the reference there, whatever it may be,<sup>8</sup> is certainly
not to the four ages ({%cf.%} also {@Triyuga@}).<sup>9</sup> The Taittirīya
Brāhmaṇa<sup>10</sup> recognizes long periods of time — {%e.g.,%} one of
100,000 years.
<div n="P"/>To the four ages, Kali, Dvāpara, Tretā, and Kṛta, there is no
certain reference in Vedic literature, though the names occur as
the designations of throws at dice (see {@Akṣa@}). In the Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa<sup>11</sup> the names occur, but it is not clear that the ages
are really meant. Haug<sup>12</sup> thought that the dice were meant:
this view is at least as probable as the alternative explanation,
which is accepted by Weber,<sup>13</sup> Roth,<sup>14</sup> Wilson,<sup>15</sup> Max Müller,<sup>16</sup>
and Muir.<sup>17</sup> Roth, indeed, believes that the verse is an inter-
polation; but in any case it must be remembered that the
passage is from a late book of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. Four
ages — Puṣya, Dvāpara, Khārvā, and Kṛta — are mentioned in
the late Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>18</sup> and the Dvāpara in the Gopatha
Brāhmaṇa.<sup>19</sup>

A quite different theory of the Yugas
is given by Shamasastry, {%Gavām Ayana,%}
141 {%et seq.,%} but his whole theory is quite
impossible. Weber once ({%Indian Litera-%}
{%ture,%} 113, n. 127) found the mention of
the quinquennial Yuga in Rv. iii. 55,
18, but that passage refers to the five
or six seasons (see Griffith, {%Hymns of%}
{%the Rigveda,%} 1, 382, n.), while i. 25, 8,
merely alludes to the intercalary month.
Weber also ({%op. cit.,%} 70, 247) considers
that the Yugas are derived from the
phases of the moon, but this idea was
long since disposed of by Roth, {%Die%}
{%Lehre von den vier Weltaltern%} (Tübingen,
1860).</F>
