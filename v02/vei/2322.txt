{@Maṭacī@}¦ occurs in a passage of the Chāndogya Upaniṣad.<sup>1</sup>
where reference is made to the {@Kurus@} being overwhelmed by
Maṭacīs.<sup>2</sup> Śaṅkara interprets the word by ‘thunderbolts’
({%aśanayaḥ%}), while Ānandatīrtha in his commentary gives, as an
alternative rendering, {%pāṣāṇa-vṛṣṭayaḥ — i.e.,%} ‘hailstones,’ which
may be the sense. The Śabdakalpadruma,<sup>3</sup> agreeing with
Ānandatīrtha,<sup>4</sup> says that Maṭacī means, ‘a kind of small red
bird’ ({%rakta-varṇa-kṣudra-pakṣi-viśeṣa,%} reading {%-pakṣī-%}), and
Jacob<sup>5</sup> suggests that the ‘locust’ is meant.
