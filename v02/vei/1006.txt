{@Janaka,@}¦ king of Videha, plays a considerable part in the
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> and the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,<sup>2</sup>
as well as in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> and the Kauṣītaki
Upaniṣad.<sup>4</sup> He was a contemporary of {@Yājñavalkya Vāja-@}
[Page1-272+ 50]
{@saneya,@}<sup>5</sup> of {@Śvetaketu Āruṇeya,@} and of other sages.<sup>6</sup> He had
become famous for his generosity and his interest in the dis-
cussion of the nature of Brahman, as ultimate basis of reality,
in the life-time of {@Ajātaśatru@} of Kāśi.<sup>7</sup> It is significant that
he maintained a close intercourse with the Brahmins of the
Kuru-Pañcālas, such as Yājñavalkya and Śvetaketu; for this
indicates that the home of the philosophy of the Upaniṣads
was in the Kuru-Pañcāla country rather than in the east.
There is a statement in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>8</sup> that he
became a Brahmin ({%brahmā%}). This does not, however, signify
a change of caste, but merely that in knowledge he became
a Brahmin (see {@Kṣatriya@}). Janaka is occasionally mentioned
in later texts: in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>9</sup> he has already
become quite mythical; in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>10</sup>
a {%sapta-rātra%} or seven nights' rite is ascribed to him.
<div n="P"/>It is natural to attempt to date Janaka by his being a con-
temporary of Ajātaśatru, and by identifying the latter with the
Ajātasattu of the Pāli texts:<sup>11</sup> this would make the end of the
sixth century B.C. the approximate date of Janaka.<sup>12</sup> But it is
very doubtful whether this identification can be supported:
Ajātaśatru was king of Kāśi, whereas Ajātasattu was king of
Magadha, and his only connexion with Kāśi was through his
marriage with the daughter of Pasenadi of Kosala.<sup>13</sup> More-
over, the acceptance of this chronology would be difficult to
reconcile with the history of the development of thought; for
it would make the rise of Buddhism contemporaneous with the
Upaniṣads, whereas it is reasonably certain that the older
Upaniṣads preceded Buddhism.<sup>14</sup> Nor do the Vedic texts know
anything of Bimbisāra or Pasenadi, or any of the other princes
famed in Buddhist records.

<div n="P"/>The identification<sup>15</sup> of Janaka of Videha and the father of
Sītā is less open to objection, but it cannot be proved, and is
somewhat doubtful. In the Sūtras Janaka appears as an
ancient king who knew of a time when wifely honour was less
respected than later.<sup>16</sup>
