{@Kitava,@}¦ ‘the gambler,’ is frequently referred to in the Rig-
veda<sup>1</sup> and later.<sup>2</sup> A father is represented as chastising his son
for gambling.<sup>3</sup> The gambler seems at times to have fallen,
along with his family, into servitude, presumably by selling
himself to pay his debts.<sup>4</sup> Technical names<sup>5</sup> for different sorts
of gamblers given in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās are Ādinava-darśa,
[Page1-157+ 49]
Kalpin, Adhi-kalpin, and Sabhā-sthāṇu. None of these can be
safely<sup>6</sup> explained, though the last has usually<sup>7</sup> been taken as a
satirical name derived from the gambler's devotion to the dicing
place ({@Sabhā@}), ‘pillar of the dicing hall.’ The first literally
means ‘seeing ill-luck,’<sup>8</sup> and may refer to the quickness of the
dicer to note an error on the part of his antagonist, or to his
eagerness to see the defeat of his rival.
