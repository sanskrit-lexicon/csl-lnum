1. {@Chandas@}¦ in the Rigveda usually denotes a ‘song of
praise’ or ‘hymn.’<sup>1</sup> The original sense of the word, as derived
from the verb {%chand,%} ‘to please,’ was probably ‘attractive
spell,’ ‘magic hymn,’<sup>2</sup> which prevailed on the gods. In a very
late hymn of the Rigveda,<sup>3</sup> as well as in one of the Atharvaveda,<sup>4</sup>
the word is mentioned in the plural ({%chandāṃsi%}), beside Ṛc
({%ṛcaḥ%}), Sāman ({%sāmāni%}), and Yajus, and seems to retain its
original meaning, not improbably with reference to the magical
subject-matter of the Atharvaveda. From denoting a (metrical)
hymn it comes to mean ‘metre’ in a very late verse of the
Rigveda,<sup>5</sup> in which the ‘Gāyatrī, the Triṣṭubh, and all ({%sarvā%})
the metres ({%chandāṃsi%}) are mentioned. In the later Saṃhitās
three<sup>6</sup> or seven<sup>7</sup> metres are enumerated, and in the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa<sup>8</sup> eight. By the time of the Rigveda Prātiśākhya<sup>9</sup>
the metres were subjected to a detailed examination, though
much earlier references are found to the number of syllables in
the several metres.<sup>10</sup> Later the word definitely denotes a Vedic
text generally, as in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>11</sup>
