{@Tārpya@}¦ denotes, in the Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> and later,<sup>2</sup> a garment
made of some material, the nature of which is uncertain. The
commentators on the Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra and the Śata-
patha Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> suggest that a linen garment, or one thrice
soaked in ghee, or one made of the {%tṛpā%} or of the {%triparṇa%} plant,
is meant: it is doubtful whether the sense was known even to
the author of the Brāhmaṇa himself. Goldstücker's<sup>4</sup> rendering
of the word is ‘silken garment,’ which Eggeling<sup>5</sup> is inclined
to accept.^6
