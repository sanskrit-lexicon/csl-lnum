{@Ṛjiśvan@}¦ is mentioned several times in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> but
always in a vague manner, as if very ancient. He assists
Indra in fights against demoniac figures like Pipru and the
dusky brood ({%kṛṣṇa-garbhāḥ%}). According to Ludwig,<sup>2</sup> he was
called Auśija's son,<sup>3</sup> but this is doubtful. He is twice<sup>4</sup> clearly
called Vaidathina, or descendant of Vidathin.
