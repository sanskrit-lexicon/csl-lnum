{@Kula, Kula-pā.@}¦ — As an uncompounded word, Kula does not
occur before the period of the Brāhmaṇas.<sup>1</sup> It denotes the
‘home’ or ‘house of the family,’ and by metonymy the family
itself, as connected with the home. The Kula-pā (lit. ‘house
protector’), or chief of the family, is mentioned in the Rigveda<sup>2</sup>
as inferior to and attendant on the {@Vrājapati@} in war, the latter
being perhaps the leader of the village contingent of the clan.
In the Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> a girl is ironically called Kulapā, because
she is left without a husband in the world, and has only Yama
(the god of death) for a spouse.
<div n="P"/>The use of the term Kula points clearly to a system of
individual families, each no doubt consisting of several members
under the headship of the father or eldest brother, whose Kula
the dwelling is. As distinct from {@Gotra,@} Kula seems to mean
the family in the narrower sense of the members who still
live in one house, the undivided family. {%Cf.%} {@Gṛha, Grāma,@}
