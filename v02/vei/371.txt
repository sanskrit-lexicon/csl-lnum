{@Upala-prakṣiṇī@}¦ occurs once in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> where it desig-
nates the occupation of a woman, as opposed to that of her
son, who is a poet ({%kāru%}), and to that of his father, who is a
physician ({%bhiṣaj%}). Yāska<sup>2</sup> renders the word by ‘maker of
groats’ ({%saktu-kārikā%}), and Roth,<sup>3</sup> Grassmann,<sup>4</sup> Zimmer,<sup>5</sup> as well
as others, connect it with the operation of grinding corn.
Pischel,<sup>6</sup> however, who points out that corn was not ground
between two stones, but beaten on a stone with a pestle ({%dṛṣad%}),
considers that Upala-prakṣiṇī denotes a woman that assisted at
the crushing of Soma ({%cf.%} {@Upara@}). Von Schroeder,<sup>7</sup> who more
correctly points out that there is no objection to regarding
{%upala%} as the mortar in which the corn was placed and then
beaten with the pestle, renders the word literally as ‘one who
fills the (lower) stone (with corn).’

taking {%pṛc%} in the sense of ‘fill,’ explains
the compound as ‘filling the upper mill-
stone,’ an interpretation which as it
stands is unintelligible.</F>

Von Schroeder does not accept the
view that the mother of the singer is
alluded to; but it seems impossible to
draw any other conclusion from the
language of the passage, and his own
explanation of the word as refer-
ring to a corn-mother is very im-
probable; {%cf.%} Keith, {%Journal of the Royal%}
{%Asiatic Society,%} 1909, 204.</F>
