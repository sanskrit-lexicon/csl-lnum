{@Rāja-pitṛ@}¦ is one of the titles given to the king in the rite of
the {@Rājasūya@} (‘royal consecration’) according to the Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa (viii. 12, 5; 17, 5). It probably designates the king
as ‘father of a king,’ and indicates the hereditary character of
the monarchy. Possibly the later plan<sup>1</sup> of associating the
king's son in the monarchy prevailed in earlier times also.

a king as father’ is also possible.</F>
