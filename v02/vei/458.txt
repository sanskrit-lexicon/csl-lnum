{@Aiti-hāsika.@}¦ — This term was applied to the people who
explained the Vedic hymns by treating them as legendary
history ({@Itihāsa@}), as Sieg<sup>1</sup> shows by the passages of the
Nirukta,<sup>2</sup> where their views are opposed to those of the
{@Nairuktas,@} who relied rather on etymology. Sieg<sup>3</sup> also seems
right in finding them in the Naidānas of the Nirukta:<sup>4</sup> it is
possible that their textbook was called the Nidāna.
