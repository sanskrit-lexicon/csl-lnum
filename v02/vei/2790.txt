2. {@Vadhū@}¦ is in one passage of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> taken by Roth<sup>2</sup>
to denote a ‘female animal,’ while Zimmer<sup>3</sup> urges that it
means a ‘female slave.’ As far as the use of Vadhū goes,
either meaning is abnormal, for if Vadhū never elsewhere
[Page2-240+ 44]
means a female animal (from {%vah,%} to ‘draw’ a cart), neither does
it denote a slave: as the passage refers to a gift of fifty Vadhūs
by {@Trasadasyu Paurukutsya@} to the singer, the latter must
have been a polygamist of an advanced type to require fifty
wives. The same doubt arises in the case of {%vadhūmant,%} which
is used in the Rigveda and Atharvaveda as an epithet of the
chariot ({@Ratha@}),<sup>4</sup> of horses ({@Aśva@}),<sup>5</sup> and of buffaloes ({@Uṣṭra@}).<sup>6</sup>
Zimmer sees in all cases a reference to slaves in the chariots or
with the horses: this interpretation has the support of the
Bṛhaddevatā.<sup>7</sup> Roth's version of the references to horses or
buffaloes as ‘suitable for draught’ is not very happy; if {%vadhū%}
is really a female animal {%vadhūmant%} means rather ‘together with
mares,’ or ‘together with female buffaloes,’ which makes reason-
able sense.<sup>8</sup>
