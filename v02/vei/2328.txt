2. {@Matsya@}¦ appears to be the name of a people in one passage
of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> where they are ranged with the other enemies
of {@Sudās,@} although it is possible to see merely the sense of
‘fish’ in that passage. In the list of Aśvamedhins, ‘offerers of
the horse sacrifice,’ in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>2</sup> {@Dhvasan@}
{@Dvaitavana@} is mentioned as a Matsya king ({@Mātsya@}). The
Matsyas as a people occur also in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad<sup>3</sup> in
[Page2-122+ 60]
connexion with the {@Vaśas,@}<sup>4</sup> and in the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>5</sup> in
connexion with {@Śālvas.@} In Manu<sup>6</sup> the {@Kurukṣetra,@} the
Matsyas, the {@Pancālas,@} and the {@Śūrasenakas@} comprise the
land of the Brahmin Ṛṣis ({%brahmarṣi-deśa%}). There is no
reason to doubt that the Matsyas occupied much the same
territory as in Epic times, say Alwar, Jaipur, Bharatpur.<sup>7</sup>
