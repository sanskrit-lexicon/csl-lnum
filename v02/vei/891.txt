1. {@Go@}¦ ({%a%}), ‘ox’ or ‘cow.’<sup>1</sup> These were among the chief
sources of wealth to the Vedic Indian, and are repeatedly
[Page1-232+ 62]
referred to from the Rigveda onwards.<sup>2</sup> The milk ({@Kṣīra@}) was
either drunk fresh or made into butter ({@Ghṛta@}) or curds ({@Dadhi@}),
or was mixed with {@Soma@} or used for cooking with grain
({@Kṣīraudana@}). The cows were milked thrice a day, early
({%prātar-doha%}), in the forenoon ({@Saṃgava@}), and in the evening
({%sāyaṃ-doha%}).<sup>3</sup> Thrice a day they were driven out to graze,
according to the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> ({%prātaḥ, saṃgave, sāyam%}).
The first milking was productive, the last two scanty.<sup>3</sup> According
to the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>5</sup> among the Bharatas the herds in
the evening are in the {@Goṣṭha,@} at midday in the {@Saṃgavīnī.@}
This passage Sāyaṇa expands by saying that the herds go home
to the Śālā, or house for animals, at night so far as they consist
of animals giving milk, while the others stayed out in the
Goṣṭha, or open pasturage; but both were together in the
cattle-shed during the heat of the day. The time before
the Saṃgava, when the cows were grazing freely on the
pastureland, was called {@Svasara.@}<sup>6</sup> When the cows were out
feeding they were separated from the calves, which were, how-
ever, allowed to join them at the Saṃgava,<sup>7</sup> and sometimes in
the evening.<sup>8</sup>
<div n="P"/>While grazing the cattle were under the care of a herdsman
({@Gopā, Gopāla@}) armed with a goad,<sup>9</sup> but they were liable to all sorts
of dangers, such as being lost, falling into pits, breaking limbs,<sup>10</sup>
[Page1-233+ 60]
and being stolen. The marking of the ears of cattle was
repeatedly adopted, no doubt, to indicate ownership.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>Large herds of cattle were well-known, as is shown by the
Dānastutis, or ‘praises of gifts,’ in the Rigveda,<sup>12</sup> even when
allowances are made for the exaggeration of priestly gratitude.
The importance attached to the possession of cattle is shown<sup>13</sup>
by the numerous passages in which the gods are asked to prosper
them, and by the repeated prayers<sup>14</sup> for wealth in kine. Hence,
too, forays for cattle ({@Gaviṣṭi@}) were well known; the Bharata
host is called the ‘horde desiring cows’ ({%gavyan grāmaḥ%}) in the
Rigveda;<sup>15</sup> and a verbal root {%gup,%}<sup>16</sup> ‘to protect,’ was evolved as
early as the Rigveda from the denominative {%go-pāya,%} ‘to guard
cows.’ The Vedic poets<sup>17</sup> do not hesitate to compare their
songs with the lowing of cows, or to liken the choir of the
singing Apsarases to cows.<sup>18</sup>
<div n="P"/>The cattle of the Vedic period were of many colours: red
({%rohita%}), light ({%śukra%}), dappled ({%pṛśni%}), even black ({%kṛṣṇa%}).<sup>19</sup>
Zimmer<sup>20</sup> sees a reference to cows with blazes on the face in one
passage of the Rigveda,<sup>21</sup> but this is uncertain.
<div n="P"/>Oxen were regularly used for ploughing or for drawing
wagons ({%anaḍvāh%}), in which case they were, it seems, usually
castrated.<sup>22</sup> Cows were not properly used for drawing carts,
though they at times did so.<sup>23</sup> The flesh of both cows and
bulls was sometimes eaten ({@Māmsa@}). Cattle were certainly the
[Page1-234+ 44]
objects of individual ownership, and they formed one of the
standards of exchange and valuation (see {@Kraya@}).
<div n="P"/>({%b%}) The term {@Go@} is often applied to express the products of
the cow. It frequently means the milk,<sup>1</sup> but rarely the flesh<sup>2</sup> of
the animal. In many passages it designates leather used as the
material of various objects, as a bowstring,<sup>3</sup> or a sling,<sup>4</sup> or
thongs to fasten part of the chariot,<sup>5</sup> or reins,<sup>6</sup> or the lash
of a whip.<sup>7</sup> See also {@Carman,@} with which Go is sometimes
synonymous.<sup>8</sup>
<div n="P"/>({%c%}) {@Gāvaḥ@} means the stars of heaven in two passages of the
Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> according to Roth.<sup>2</sup>

cows were driven out from the cattle-

of the day in the Saṃgavinī, were then
driven out during the evening to graze,
and finally came or were driven home,
