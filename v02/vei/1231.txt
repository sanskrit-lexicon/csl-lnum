{@Try-āśir,@}¦ ‘with three admixtures,’ is an epithet of Soma in
the Rigveda.<sup>1</sup> According to Sāyaṇa this means mixed with
curds ({@Dadhi@}), meal ({@Saktu@}), and milk ({@Payas@}). More accurately
it would seem<sup>2</sup> to denote the milk ({%gavāśir%}), the barley ({%yavāśir%}),
and the curds ({%dadhyāśir%}), which were used to mix with the
Soma.
