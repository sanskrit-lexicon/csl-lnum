{@Hastin,@}¦ ‘having a hand,’ with {@Mṛga,@} ‘beast,’ denotes in the
Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and the Atharvaveda<sup>2</sup> the ‘elephant.’ Later the
adjective alone comes to mean ‘elephant.’<sup>3</sup> The animal was
famed for its strength<sup>4</sup> as well as its virility.<sup>5</sup> It is mentioned
with man and monkey as one of the beasts that take hold by
the hand ({%hastādāna%}), as opposed to those that take hold by the
mouth ({%mukhādāna%}).<sup>6</sup> It was tamed, as the expression {@Hastipa,@}
‘elephant-keeper,’ shows, and tame elephants were used to
catch others (see {@Vāraṇa@}). But there is no trace of its use in
war, though Ktesias and Megasthenes both record such use for
[Page2-502+ 46]
their times.<sup>7</sup> The Atharvaveda<sup>8</sup> alludes to its being pestered
by mosquitoes.
