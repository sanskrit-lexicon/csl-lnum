{@Maṇḍūka@}¦ is the name of ‘frog’ in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later,<sup>2</sup>
the feminine Maṇḍūkī also occurring.<sup>3</sup> The famous frog hymn
of the Rigveda<sup>4</sup> compares with Brahmins the frogs croaking
[Page2-121+ 56]
as they awake to activity at the beginning of the rains. It has
been explained by Max Müller<sup>5</sup> as a satire on the Brahmins.
Geldner,<sup>6</sup> agreeing with this view, thinks that it is directed by
its {@Vasiṣṭha@} composer against rival Brahmins, probably the
{@Viśvāmitras.@}<sup>7</sup> The view, however, which interprets the hymn
as a rain charm<sup>8</sup> seems on the whole more likely. The frog,
from its connexion with water, was considered to have cooling
properties. Thus after the burning of the dead body the frog
is invited to come to the spot where the cremation has taken
place in order to cool it down.<sup>9</sup> Similarly the frog is invoked
in the Atharvaveda against the fire of fever.<sup>10</sup>
