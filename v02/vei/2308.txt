{@Bhrātṛvya@}¦ is found in one passage of the Atharvaveda,<sup>1</sup>
where, being named with brother and sister, it must be an
expression of relationship. The sense appears to be ‘(father's)
brother's son,’ ‘cousin,’<sup>2</sup> this meaning alone accounting for the
sense of ‘rival,’ ‘enemy,’ found elsewhere in the Atharvaveda,<sup>3</sup>
and repeatedly in the other Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas.<sup>4</sup> In
an undivided family the relations of cousins would easily
develop into rivalry and enmity. The original meaning may,
however, have been ‘nephew,’<sup>5</sup> as the simple etymological
sense would be ‘brother's son’; but this seems not to account
for the later meaning so well. The Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>6</sup> pre-
scribes the telling of a falsehood to a Bhrātṛvya, who, further,
is often given the epithets ‘hating’ ({%dviṣan%}) and ‘evil’ ({%apriya,%}
{%pāpman%}) in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas.<sup>7</sup> The Athar-
vaveda<sup>8</sup> also contains various spells, which aim at destroying or
expelling one's ‘rivals.’
