<L>834<pc>1-217<k1>Kela<k2>Kela
{@Khela@}¦ occurs in one passage of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> where Pischel<sup>2</sup>
considers that a god, Vivasvant, is meant, and that races were
run in his honour, explaining thus the phrase {%ājā khelasya,%} as
‘in the race of Khela.’ Roth<sup>3</sup> thinks that a man is meant,
and Sieg,<sup>4</sup> following Sāyaṇa, sees in him a king whose Purohita
was Agastya. See also {@Aṃśu.@}
