{@Kesara-prābandhā.@}¦ — In the list of the crimes of the {@Vaita-@}
{@havyas@} narrated in the Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> is the cooking of the last
she-goat ({%caramājām%}) of Kesaraprābandhā, who may presum-
ably be deemed to have been a woman, ‘having braided hair.’<sup>2</sup>
Ludwig,<sup>3</sup> followed by Whitney,<sup>4</sup> appears to amend the passage
({%carama-jām%}) as meaning ‘the last-born calf’ of Kesaraprā-
bandhā, a cow. But this interpretation does not suit the name
so well.
