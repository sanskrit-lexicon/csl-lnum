1. {@Muñja@}¦ denotes a grass, the {%Saccharum Muñja,%} which is
of luxuriant growth, attaining to a height of ten feet. It is
mentioned in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> along with other kinds of grasses
as the lurking-place of venomous creatures. In the same text<sup>2</sup>
the Muñja grass is spoken of as purifying, apparently being
used as the material of a filter for Soma. The grass is often
mentioned in the later Saṃhitās<sup>3</sup> and the Brāhmaṇas.<sup>4</sup> It is
in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>5</sup> said to be ‘hollow’ ({%suṣira%}) and
to be used for the plaited part of the throne ({@Āsandī@}).<sup>6</sup>
