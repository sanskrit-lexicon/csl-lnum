{@Śāṇḍilyāyana,@}¦ ‘descendant of {@Śāṇḍilya,@}’ is the patronymic
of a teacher in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>1</sup> Apparently he is
identical with {@Celaka,@} also mentioned in that text;<sup>2</sup> it is thus
reasonable to suppose that {@Cailaki Jīvala@}<sup>3</sup> was his son. It is
much more doubtful whether he was<sup>4</sup> the grandfather of
{@Pravāhaṇa Jaivala,@} who was a prince rather than a Brahmin.
