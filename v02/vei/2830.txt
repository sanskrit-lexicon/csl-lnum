{@Varman@}¦ denotes ‘body armour,’ ‘coat of mail,’ ‘corselet,’ in
the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later.<sup>2</sup> Of what material it was made is
[Page2-272+ 52]
uncertain; there are references to sewing ({%syūta%})<sup>3</sup> which may
be reckoned in favour of the use of linen corselets such as those
recorded by Herodotus,<sup>4</sup> but there is a later reference<sup>5</sup> to
corselets of {@Ayas, Loha,@} or {@Rajata,@} on which it is doubtful
whether much stress can be laid. They may, however, have
been either of metal or of leather covered with metal.
