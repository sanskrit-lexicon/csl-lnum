{@Divodāsa Atithigva@}¦ is one of the leading princes of the
early Vedic age. He was a son of Vadhryaśva,<sup>1</sup> and father,
or more probably grandfather, of {@Sudās,@} the famous king of the
{@Tṛtsu@} family, among the {@Bharatas.@} Probably Pijavana was
the son and Sudās the grandson. Divodāsa was naturally a
{@Bharata,@}<sup>2</sup> and, like Sudās, was an opponent of the {@Turvaśas@}
and {@Yadus.@}<sup>3</sup> His great enemy was {@Śambara,@} the {@Dāsa,@} who
was apparently chief of a mountain people,<sup>4</sup> and whom he
repeatedly defeated.<sup>5</sup> He was also, it seems, like his father
Vadhryaśva,<sup>6</sup> an energetic supporter of the fire ritual, for Agni
is once called by his name in the Rigveda.<sup>7</sup> On the other hand,
he was defeated, with {@Āyu@} and {@Kutsa,@} by Indra's aid. In
several passages he seems closely connected with the singer
family, the {@Bharadvājas.@}<sup>8</sup>
<div n="P"/>From one passage,<sup>9</sup> where Divodāsa is said to have fought
against the {@Paṇis,@} the {@Pārāvatas,@} and {@Bṛsaya,@} Hillebrandt<sup>10</sup>
has inferred that he was engaged in conflicts with the tribes
of Arachosia, and interpreting the name as the ‘heavenly
Dāsa’<sup>11</sup> conjectures that he was himself a Dāsa. This con-
clusion is not probable, for the {@Sarasvatī@} on which the battle
in question took place, and which can hardly be the Haraqaiti
of Arachosia, would naturally designate the later Sarasvatī,
while the Pārāvatas are mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāh-
maṇa,<sup>12</sup> as in the east, about the {@Yamunā.@} Bergaigne's
[Page1-364+ 60]
opinion<sup>13</sup> that Divodāsa and Atithigva were different people
cannot be supported in view of the complete parallelism in the
acts of the two persons.<sup>14</sup> See also {@Pratardana.@}
<div n="P"/>The people of Divodāsa are referred to in a hymn of the
Rigveda.<sup>15</sup>
