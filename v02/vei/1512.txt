{@Nanāndṛ@}¦ is a word occurring only once in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup>
where it denotes, according to Sāyaṇa, the ‘husband's sister,’
over whom the wife is to rule. This interpretation is confirmed
by the fact that the same position is ascribed to the husband's
sister — no doubt while unmarried and living in her brother's
care — by the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>2</sup>
