{@Pavi@}¦ denotes the ‘tire’ of the wheel of a chariot in the
Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later.<sup>2</sup> Reference is made<sup>3</sup> to the necessity for
fastening it on firmly, and the epithet {%su-pavi,%} ‘having a good
tire,’ is found in the Atharvaveda<sup>4</sup> with {%su-nābhi,%} ‘having a good
nave,’ and {%su-cakra,%} ‘having a good wheel.’ The tires were, of
course, of metal,<sup>5</sup> and being sharp,<sup>6</sup> could serve on occasion as
weapons.<sup>7</sup> The St. Petersburg Dictionary in one passage of
[Page1-508+ 54]
the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>8</sup> takes Pavi to mean a metal rim on the
stone for pounding Soma, but this seems improbable, because
no such metal attachment is elsewhere alluded to. Hille-
brandt<sup>9</sup> seems clearly right in accepting the sense of ‘sharp
edge’ in this passage, especially as the stones in the Rigveda<sup>10</sup>
are, in allusion to their rolling action, styled ‘rims without
horses and without chariots’ ({%anaśvāsaḥ pavayo 'rathāḥ%}).
<div n="P"/>The Nirukta<sup>11</sup> ascribes to Pavi the sense of arrow ({%śalya%}), but
this is very uncertain. The St. Petersburg Dictionary cites for
this use two passages of the Rigveda,<sup>12</sup> but in one the secondary
sense of sharp-edged weapon with reference to the bolt of Indra
is quite likely, and in the other, where the expression {%vāṇasya%}
{%pavi%} occurs, the sharp-edged pounding-stone of the ‘reed,’<sup>13</sup>
meaning the stalk of the Soma plant, may be meant. Hille-
brandt<sup>14</sup> thinks a reference to the shape of the Soma plant is
intended. Pavī-nasa, the name of a demon mentioned in the
Atharvaveda,<sup>15</sup> seems to throw no light on this point, for while
the St. Petersburg Dictionary takes it to mean ‘whose nose is
like a spearhead,’ it is translated as ‘rim-nosed’ (presumably in
allusion to the curved shape of the nose) by Whitney.<sup>16</sup>
