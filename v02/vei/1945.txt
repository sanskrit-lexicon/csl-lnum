{@Paiṅgya,@}¦ ‘descendant of Piṅga,’ is the name of a teacher
who is repeatedly mentioned as an authority in the Kauṣītaki
Brāhmaṇa,<sup>1</sup> where<sup>2</sup> also his doctrine is called the Paiṅgya.
This teacher is further referred to in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>3</sup>
which also speaks of {@Madhuka@} Paiṅgya.<sup>4</sup> It is, of course,
impossible to say whether there was only one Paiṅgya or several
Paiṅgyas. The followers of Paiṅgya are called Paiṅgins in the
Nidāna<sup>5</sup> and Anupada<sup>6</sup> Sūtras. His text-book is called Paiṅga
in the Anupada Sūtra,<sup>7</sup> while the Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra<sup>8</sup>
mentions a Paiṅgāyani Brāhmaṇa. It is clear that Paiṅgya
was a teacher of a Rigveda school allied to the Kauṣītakis.
Paiṅgi is a patronymic of {@Yāska@} in the Anukramanī of the
Ātreyī Śākhā.<sup>9</sup>
