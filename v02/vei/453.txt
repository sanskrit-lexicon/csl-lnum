{@Evāvada@}¦ is regarded by Ludwig<sup>1</sup> in a very obscure passage
of the Rigveda<sup>2</sup> as the name of a singer beside {@Kṣatra, Manasa,@}
and {@Yajata.@} The commentator Sāyaṇa also interprets the
word as a proper name. Roth,<sup>3</sup> however, considers it to be an
adjective meaning ‘truthful.’
