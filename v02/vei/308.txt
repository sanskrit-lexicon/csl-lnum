{@Ikṣvāku.@}¦ — In the Rigveda this name occurs but once,<sup>1</sup> and in
a doubtful context. It is clear, however, that it denotes a
prince; later interpretations make {@Asamāti,@} whose name is read
into the hymn, an Ikṣvāku prince.<sup>2</sup> In the Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> also
the name is found in only one passage, where it is uncertain
whether a descendant of Ikṣvāku, or Ikṣvāku himself, is referred
to; in either case he seems to be regarded as an ancient hero.
In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> mention is made of {@Tryaruṇa@}
{@Traidhātva@} Aikṣvāka, who is identical with the {@Tryaruṇa@}
{@Traivṛṣṇa@} of the Bṛhaddevatā,<sup>5</sup> and with {@Tryaruṇa Trasa-@}
{@dasyu@} in the Rigveda.<sup>6</sup> The connection of Trasadasyu with
the Ikṣvākus is confirmed by the fact that {@Purukutsa@} was an
Aikṣvāka, according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>7</sup> Thus the
Ikṣvāku line was originally a line of princes of the Pūrus.
Zimmer<sup>8</sup> places them on the upper Indus, but they may well
have been somewhat further east.<sup>9</sup> Later Ikṣvāku is connected
with Ayodhyā
