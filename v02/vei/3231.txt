{@Śāṇḍilya,@}¦ ‘descendant of Śaṇḍila,’ is the patronymic of
several teachers (see {@Udara@} and {@Suyajña@}). The most important
Śāṇḍilya is the one cited several times as an authority in the
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>1</sup> where his Agni, or ‘sacrificial fire,’ is
called Śāṇḍila.<sup>2</sup> From this it appears clearly that he was one
of the great teachers of the fire ritual which occupies the fifth
and following books of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. In the
Vaṃśa (list of teachers) at the end of the tenth book<sup>3</sup> he is
given as a pupil of {@Kuśri@} and a teacher of {@Vātsya;@} another list
at the end of the last book in the Kāṇva recension<sup>4</sup> gives him
as a pupil of Vātsya, and the latter as a pupil of Kuśri. In the
confused and worthless<sup>5</sup> lists of teachers at the end of the
second and fourth books of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad he is
said to be the pupil of various persons — {@Kaiśorya Kāpya,@}<sup>6</sup>
{@Vaiṣṭapureya,@}<sup>7</sup> {@Kauśika,@}<sup>8</sup> {@Gautama,@}<sup>9</sup> {@Baijavāpa,@}<sup>10</sup> and {@Āṇa-@}
[Page2-372+ 39]
{@bhimlāta.@}<sup>11</sup> No doubt different Śāṇḍilyas may be meant, but
the lists are too confused to claim serious consideration.
