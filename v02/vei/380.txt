{@Upānasa@}¦ is in the Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> opposed to {@Akṣa,@} and must
mean something like ‘the body of the wagon,’ though Sāyaṇa
suggests that it signifies either a ‘granary’ or a ‘wagon full of
grain.’ In the Rigveda,<sup>2</sup> where the word occurs only once, its
sense is doubtful. Pischel<sup>3</sup> explains the form which occurs
there not as an adjective, but as an infinitive.
