1. {@Dāna,@}¦ ‘giving,’ ‘gift,’ is a word of frequent occurrence in
the Rigveda, especially in the Dāna-stutis<sup>1</sup> (‘Praises of Gifts’)
of generous patrons (see {@Dakṣiṇā@}). One of the characteristics
of the {@Brāhmaṇa@} is his right to receive gifts, which it is
obligatory on the other castes to present.<sup>2</sup> The gift of a
daughter ({%kanyāyā dānam%}) was a form of marriage<sup>3</sup> (see {@Vivāha@}),
because in it the girl was ‘given’ away by her father or
brother.
