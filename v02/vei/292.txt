{@Āsaṅga Plāyogi@}¦ is a king who appears in a Dānastuti
(‘Praise of Gifts’) in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as a generous patron.
Owing, however, to the addition of a curious phallic verse to
the hymn, and its early misunderstanding,<sup>2</sup> a legend was
invented that he lost his manhood and became a woman, but
by the intercession of {@Medhyātithi@} was transformed into a man,
much to the delight of his wife, {@Śaśvatī,@} whose existence is
based on a misunderstanding of the phrase ‘every woman’
({%śaśvatī nārī%}) in the added verse.<sup>3</sup> Another misunderstanding
[Page1-071+ 50]
of the Dānastuti<sup>4</sup> gives him a son Svanad-ratha, really a mere
epithet, and makes him a descendant of Yadu.
