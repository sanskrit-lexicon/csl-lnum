{@Sapta Sūryāḥ,@}¦ the ‘seven suns’ referred to in the Saṃhitās,<sup>1</sup>
are named in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka<sup>2</sup> as Āroga, Bhrāja,
Paṭara, Pataṅga, Svarṇara, Jyotiṣīmant, and Vibhāsa, but these
occur very rarely even later.<sup>3</sup> Weber at one time<sup>4</sup> thought
that the seven planets (see {@Graha@}) were meant by the phrase,
but later he abandoned the idea.<sup>5</sup> Probably the ‘seven rays’
of the Rigveda<sup>6</sup> are meant.
