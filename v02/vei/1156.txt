{@Tirya@}¦ occurs in the Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> as an epithet of {@Karambha,@}
‘gruel.’ It is probably equivalent to {%tilya,%} ‘made of sesamum,’
as rendered by Roth<sup>2</sup> and Whitney,<sup>3</sup> but {%tiriya%} is read by
Roth<sup>4</sup> in the Rāja-nighaṇṭu as a kind of rice.

<F>4) See Whitney, {%loc. cit.,%} with Lan-
man's additional note. Bloomfield,
{%Hymns of the Atharvaveda,%} 377, construes
the adjective with {%viṣam,%} and renders
‘the poison which comes in a horizontal
direction’ ({%cf. tiryañc%}). Grill, {%Hundert%}
{%Lieder,%}^2 121, amends to {%atiriya,%} ‘over-
flowing.’
