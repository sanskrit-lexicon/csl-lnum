{@Kakṣīvant@}¦ is the name of a Ṛṣi mentioned frequently in the
Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> and occasionally elsewhere.<sup>2</sup> He appears to have
been a descendant of a female slave named Uśij.<sup>3</sup> He must
have been a {@Pajra@} by family, as he bears the epithet Pajriya,<sup>4</sup>
[Page1-132+ 55]
and his descendants are called Pajras.<sup>5</sup> In a hymn of the
Rigveda<sup>6</sup> he celebrates the prince {@Svanaya Bhāvya,@} who
dwelt on the {@Sindhu@} (Indus), as having bestowed magnificent
gifts on him; and the list of Nārāśaṃsas (‘Praises of Heroes’)
in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>7</sup> mentions one by Kakṣīvant
Auśija in honour of Svanaya Bhāvayavya. In his old age he
obtained as a wife the maiden {@Vṛcayā.@}<sup>8</sup> He appears to have
lived to be a hundred,<sup>9</sup> the typical length of life in the Vedas.
He seems always to be thought of as belonging to the past, and
in a hymn of the fourth book of the Rigveda<sup>10</sup> he is mentioned
with the semi-mythical {@Kutsa@} and {@Kavi Uśanas.@} Later, also,
he is a teacher of bygone days.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>In Vedic literature he is not connected with {@Dīrghatamas@}
beyond being once mentioned along with him in a hymn of the
Rigveda.<sup>12</sup> But in the Bṛhaddevatā<sup>13</sup> he appears as a son of
Dīrghatamas by a slave woman, Uśij.
<div n="P"/>Weber<sup>14</sup> considers that Kakṣīvant was originally a Kṣatriya,
not a Brāhmaṇa, quoting in favour of this view the fact that
he is mentioned beside kings like {@Para Āṭṇāra, Vītahavya@}
{@Śrāyasa,@} and {@Trasadasyu Paurukutsya.@}<sup>15</sup> But that these are
all kings is an unnecessary assumption: these persons are
mentioned in the passages in question undoubtedly only as
famous men of old, to whom are ascribed mythical sacrificial
performances, and who thus gained numerous sons.
