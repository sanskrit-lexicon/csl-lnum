{@Sūnu@}¦ is a common word for ‘son’ from the Rigveda
onwards.<sup>1</sup> The etymological sense seems to be ‘he who is
borne,’ and then ‘the begotten.’<sup>2</sup> But the use of Sūnu in the
Rigveda<sup>3</sup> is predominantly in relation to the father, and only
rarely in its connexion with words for mother.<sup>4</sup> Thus a father
is ‘easy of access’ ({%sāpāyana%}) to his son ({%sūnu%});<sup>5</sup> but in another
passage,<sup>6</sup> where the same term is applied to earth as a mother,
the word used for son is {@Putra.@} No conclusion as to matriarchy
can of course be drawn from the etymology. On the relation
of son and father, see {@Pitṛ.@}
