{@Vīta-havya@}¦ is the name of a prince who is mentioned in the
Rigveda<sup>1</sup> along with {@Bharadvāja,@} and as a contemporary of
{@Sudās,@}<sup>2</sup> though in both passages it is possible to understand the
[Page2-317+ 49]
word as a mere adjective. In the Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> Vītahavya
appears as connected with {@Jamadagni@} and {@Asita,@} but it is clear
that the legend there has no value. It is possible, though not
certain, that he was a king of the {@Sṛṇjayas.@}<sup>4</sup> In the Yajurveda
Saṃhitās<sup>5</sup> a Vītahavya {@Śrāyasa@} appears as a king: he may be
identical with the Vītahavya of the Rigveda, or belong to the
same line. {%Cf.%} {@Vaitahavya.@}

he is represented as being {%niruddha,%}
apparently in ‘banishment’; but the
scholiast explains him as not a king,
but a Ṛṣi, which is quite possible.
