{@Paura,@}¦ ‘descendant of Pūru,’ is the name of a man, presum-
ably a Pūru prince helped by Indra, in a hymn of the Rigveda.<sup>1</sup>
The Greek <lang n="greek">Πῶρος</lang> the name of Alexander's rival, is probably
the representative of this word. Oldenberg<sup>2</sup> sees the same
name in another passage also.<sup>3</sup>
