{@Dhur@}¦ in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later<sup>2</sup> denotes, according to the
St. Petersburg Dictionary, that part of the yoke which is
placed on the shoulders of the animals drawing the chariot or
cart, whence they are called {%dhūr-ṣāh,%} ‘yoke-bearing,’ in the
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā.<sup>3</sup> In one passage of the Rigveda<sup>4</sup> the
sense is uncertain: Roth<sup>5</sup> takes it to mean the pin at either
end of the axle ({@Akṣa@}) which goes through the nave of the
wheel, and would thus be equivalent to {@Āṇi,@} and Oldenberg<sup>6</sup>
[Page1-402+ 42]
seems to adopt the same view. Monier Williams<sup>7</sup> seems to
think that ‘load’ is meant, but this is not probable. It is
possible that Dhur has the sense of ‘pole,’<sup>8</sup> and then more
generally still the pole and the axle together regarded as the
drawing part of the chariot: this might explain the use in the
doubtful passage of the Rigveda.

Later, the word means the ‘end of the
pole,’ a sense already found in the
Aitareya Āraṇyaka (n. 2). This modi-
fication of meaning seems to be due to
the fact that the yoke is at the end of
the pole. See also {@Dhūrṣad.@}</F>
