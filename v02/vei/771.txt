{@Kraya,@}¦ ‘sale,’ is a word which does not actually occur in the
Rigveda, though the verb {%krī,%} from which this noun is derived,
is found there.<sup>1</sup> Both noun and verb are common in the later
Saṃhitās.<sup>2</sup> Sale appears to have regularly consisted in barter
in the Rigveda:<sup>3</sup> ten cows are regarded as a possible price for
an (image of) Indra to be used as a fetish, while elsewhere not
a hundred, nor a thousand, nor a myriad are considered as an
adequate price ({%śulka%}) for the purchase of Indra.<sup>4</sup> The Athar-
vaveda<sup>5</sup> mentions, as possible objects of commerce, garments
({%dūrśa%}), coverlets ({%pavasta%}), and goatskins ({%ajina%}). The haggling
of the market was already familiar in the days of the Rigveda,<sup>6</sup>
and a characteristic hymn of the Atharvaveda<sup>7</sup> is directed to
procuring success in trade. The ‘price’ was called {@Vasna,@} and
the ‘merchant’ {@Vaṇij.@} his greed being well known.<sup>8</sup>
<div n="P"/>There is little evidence of a standard of value in currency
having been adopted. When no specific mention is made of
the standard, the unit was probably the cow.<sup>9</sup> In a consider-
able number of passages of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>10</sup> and
elsewhere,<sup>11</sup> however, the expression {%hiraṇyaṃ śata-mānam%}
suggests that there must have been some standard other than
[Page1-197+ 48]
cows, though it might in all these passages be rendered as
‘gold worth a hundred cows.’ But the use of the {@Kṛṣṇala@} as a
measure of weight<sup>12</sup> suggests that the meaning is ‘gold weighing
a hundred Kṛṣṇalas,’ and this seems the more probable explana-
tion. This unit seems not to be known in the Rigveda, where
the meaning of the term {@Manā,@} which occurs once, is mysterious,
and where necklets ({@Niṣka@}) seem to have been one of the more
portable forms of wealth, like jewellery in modern India, and
may perhaps have served as a means of exchange.
