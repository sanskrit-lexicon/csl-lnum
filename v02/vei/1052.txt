{@Jāmi,@}¦ a word which appears originally to have meant
‘related in blood,’ is not rarely used as an epithet of ‘sister’
({@Svasṛ@}), and sometimes even denotes ‘sister’ itself, the
emphasis being on the blood-relationship.<sup>1</sup> So it appears in
a passage of the Atharvaveda,<sup>2</sup> where ‘brotherless sisters’
[Page1-285+ 39]
({%abhrātara iva jāmayaḥ%}) are referred to. The word is similarly
used in the dispute occurring in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> as to
the precedence of Rākā, or of the wives of the gods, in a certain
rite. One party is there described as holding that the sister
should be preferred ({%jāmyai vai pūrva-peyam%}) — apparently at a
ceremonial family meal — to the wife, presumably as being of
one blood with the husband, while the wife is not (being {%anyo-%}
{%daryā,%} ‘of another womb’).<sup>4</sup> In the neuter<sup>5</sup> the word means
‘relationship,’ like {%jāmi-tva,%} which also occurs in the Rigveda.<sup>6</sup>
