2. {@Rohiṇī,@}¦ ‘ruddy,’ is the name of the conspicuously reddish
star, <lang n="greek">α</lang> Tauri or Aldebaran, and denotes the group of the
Hyades, <lang n="greek">α θ γ δ ε</lang> Tauri. Its identification seems absolutely
assured by the legend of Prajāpati in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>69</sup>
He is there represented as pursuing his daughter with incestuous
intention, and as having been shot with an arrow ({@Iṣu Trikāṇḍā,@}
‘the belt of Orion’) by the ‘huntsman’ ({@Mṛgavyādha,@}
‘Sirius’). Prajāpati is clearly Orion (Mṛgaśiras being the
name of the little group of stars in Orion's head).
