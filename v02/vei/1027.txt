2. {@Jaritṛ.@}¦ According to Sieg,<sup>1</sup> mention is made in one
hymn of the Rigveda<sup>2</sup> of Jaritṛ, one of the Śārṅgas. That
hymn he seeks to bring into connexion with the epic<sup>3</sup> tradition
[Page1-279+ 35]
of the Ṛṣi Mandapāla, who wedded Jaritā, a female Śārṅga
bird — apparently a hen sparrow ({%caṭakā%}) — and had four sons.
These being abandoned by him and exposed to the danger of
being consumed by a forest fire, prayed to Agni with the hymn
Rigveda x. 142. This interpretation is very doubtful, though
Sāyaṇa<sup>4</sup> appears to have adopted it.
