{@Taskara@}¦ occurs in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and frequently later,<sup>2</sup> denoting
‘thief’ or ‘robber.’ It appears to be practically synonymous
with {@Stena,@} in connexion with which it is often mentioned.<sup>3</sup>
The Stena and the Taskara are contrasted in the Vājasaneyi
Saṃhitā<sup>4</sup> with the {@Malimlu,@} who is a burglar or house-breaker,
while they are highwaymen, or, as the Rigveda<sup>5</sup> puts it, ‘men
who haunt the woods and risk their lives’ ({%tanū-tyajā vanar-gū%}).
In another passage of the Rigveda,<sup>6</sup> however, the dog is told to
bark at the Taskara or the Stena, which clearly points to an
attempt at house-breaking. The thief goes about at night,<sup>7</sup> and
knows the paths<sup>8</sup> on which he attacks his victim. In one
passage of the Rigveda<sup>9</sup> the use of cords is mentioned, but
whether to bind the thieves when captured, or to bind the
[Page1-303+ 53]
victim, is not clear.<sup>10</sup> The Atharvaveda<sup>11</sup> refers to the Stena
and the Taskara as cattle and horse thieves.<sup>12</sup>
