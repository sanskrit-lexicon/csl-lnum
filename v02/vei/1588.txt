{@Ni-ṣaṅgin@}¦ is found three times in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> where,
owing to its following in one passage<sup>2</sup> the words {%sudhanvāna%}
{%iṣumanto,%} ‘having good bows and arrows,’ the sense of
{%niṣaṅginaḥ%} as ‘having quivers’ seems quite certain. In the
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>3</sup> it is taken by the commentator Mahīdhara
to mean ‘having a sword,’ a sense which is quite possible both
there and in the other passages<sup>4</sup> where it occurs. But the
word far more probably means ‘having a quiver,’ for the bow
was the Vedic weapon, not the sword ({@Asi@}).
