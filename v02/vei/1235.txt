{@Tsaru,@}¦ — ({%a%}) This word seems to denote some sort of crawling
animal in one passage of the Rigveda.<sup>1</sup>
<div n="P"/>({%b%}) In the later literature the word means a ‘handle,’ as of
a beaker ({@Camasa@}).<sup>1</sup> In this sense also it seems to occur in the
description of the plough ({@Lāṅgala@}) in the Atharvaveda<sup>2</sup> and
the later Saṃhitās.<sup>3</sup>

Dharma Sūtra, ii. 34, have {%somapitsaru,%}
which Vasiṣṭha renders as ‘provided
with a handle for the drinker of Soma’
({%i.e., somapi-tsaru%}). Weber, {%Indische%}
{%Studien,%} 17, 255, suggests {%soma-sa-tsaru,%}
‘with ({%sa-%}) strap ({%uman,%} a conjectural
word) and handle’ ({%tsaru%}). Whitney,
Translation of the Atharvaveda, 116,
prefers to read throughout {%sumati-tsaru,%}
‘with well-smoothed handle,’ from the
root seen in {%matī-kṛ,%} etc. {%Cf.%} Zimmer,
