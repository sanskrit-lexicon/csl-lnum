{@Krivi@}¦ is asserted in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> to have been
the older name of the {@Pañcālas.@} This statement is supported
by the name of the king there mentioned, {@Kraivya Pāñcāla,@}
The Krivis appear in the Rigveda<sup>2</sup> as settled on the {@Sindhu@}
and the {@Asiknī.@} It is a plausible conjecture of Zimmer's<sup>3</sup> that
with the {@Kurus@} they made up the {@Vaikarṇa@} people.<sup>4</sup> The
importance of the Pañcālas, and the insignificance of the
Krivis, may be explained in part by the fact that the later
Kuru-Pañcāla alliance included the {@Bharatas.@} It is also
probable, as Oldenberg<sup>5</sup> suggests, from the Śatapatha Brāh-
maṇa,<sup>6</sup> that the {@Turvaśas@} were included in the Pañcālas, and
as the latter name indicates, probably other tribes also. Or, if
Hopkins' view<sup>7</sup> is accepted that Turvaśa was king of the
Yadus, the latter may in part have been allied with the Krivis
to form the Pañcālas.

<F>2) viii. 20, 24; 22, 12. Elsewhere-
Krivi is doubtful in sense. In several
passages (i. 30, 1; viii. 87, 1; ix. 9, 6,
and perhaps i. 166, 6, where {%krivir-datī%}
is an epithet of lightning) Oldenberg,
{%Ṛgveda-Noten,%} i. 166, 341, understands
the word to mean ‘horse.’ Elsewhere
(ii. 17, 6; 22, 2; viii. 51, 8) he takes it
to be a proper name, while in v. 44, 4,
he is doubtful. In the passages last
cited this view may very well be
correct.</F>

{%Society,%} 15, 258 {%et seq.%} This view is
hardly convincing, while the disappear-
ance of the Turvaśas is easily to be
accounted for by their being merged,
along with the Krivis, in the Pañcālas.
The name of Krivi is lost in the Epic
as completely as that of Turvaśa
(Pargiter, {%Journal of the Royal Asiatic%}
{%Society,%} 1910, 48, notes 4, 5).
