{@Dvīpa,@}¦ ‘island,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later.<sup>2</sup> But
there is no reason to imagine that the islands referred to were
other than sandbanks in the great rivers, Indus or Ganges.<sup>3</sup>

according to which the earth consists of four, seven, or thirteen
Dvīpas grouped round Mount Meru.
