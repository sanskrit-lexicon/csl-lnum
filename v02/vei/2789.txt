1. {@Vadhū@}¦ is a frequent word for ‘woman’ in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup>
and later.<sup>2</sup> It denotes, according to Delbrück,<sup>3</sup> the woman as
either married or as seeking a husband, or as a bride in the
wedding ceremony. The word appears to be derived from a
form of the root {%vah,%} ‘to carry,’ as is {%vahatu,%} ‘the bridal pro-
cession,’ thus meaning ‘she who is to be or has been conducted
home.’ Zimmer,<sup>4</sup> however, objects to this explanation,
regarding {%vadhū%} as a derivative from a different root meaning
‘to marry.’
