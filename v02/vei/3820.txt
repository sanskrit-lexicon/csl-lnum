{@Hṛdayāmaya,@}¦ ‘disease of the heart,’ is mentioned in the
Atharvaveda in connexion with {@Yakṣma@}<sup>1</sup> and with {@Balāsa.@}<sup>2</sup>
[Page2-507+ 45]
Zimmer,<sup>3</sup> who thinks that {@Balāsa@} is consumption, connects the
name with the later view of the medical Saṃhitās,<sup>4</sup> that love
is one of the causes of the disease. But it would be more
natural to see in it a disease affecting the heart.
