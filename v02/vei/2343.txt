{@Madhyama-vah@}¦ occurs in one passage of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as an
epithet of the chariot. The exact interpretation is doubtful.
Roth<sup>2</sup> assigns to it the expression the sense of ‘driving with a
single horse between the shafts.’ According to Sāyana's
explanation, it means ‘driving with middling speed.’ It might
mean ‘driving in the middle’ — that is, ‘only half-way.’^3

The context seems to require the sense
of ‘keeping away’ from the sacrifice.
