{@Pra-karitṛ@}¦ is the name of one of the victims at the Puruṣa-
medha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda.<sup>1</sup> The exact sense
is uncertain; the commentator Sāyaṇa on the Taittirīya Brāh-
maṇa explains it to mean the ‘divider of dear ones by producing
enmity,’ but the sense of ‘sprinkler’ — that is, ‘seasoner’ — is
more likely.
