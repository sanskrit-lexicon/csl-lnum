{@Mantra@}¦ (from the root {%man,%} ‘think’) denotes in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup>
and later<sup>2</sup> the ‘hymn’ as the product of the singer's creative
thought. In the Brāhmaṇas<sup>3</sup> the word is regularly used of the
poetic and prose utterances of the Ṛṣis, including not merely
the verse parts of the Saṃhitās, but also the prose formulæ
that betray by their style their special and archaic character.<sup>4</sup>
