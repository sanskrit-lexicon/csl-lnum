{@Siṃha@}¦ denotes the ‘lion’ in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later.<sup>2</sup> The
roaring ({%nad%}) of the lion is often alluded to,<sup>2</sup> and is called
thundering ({%stanatha%}).<sup>4</sup> He wanders about ({%ku-cara%}) and lives
in the hills ({%giri-ṣṭha%}),<sup>5</sup> and is clearly the ‘dread wild beast that
slays’ ({%mṛgo bhīma upahatnuḥ%})<sup>6</sup> to which Rudra is compared.
When Agni, who has entered the waters, is compared to a
lion,<sup>7</sup> the reference may be to the lion's habit of springing on
animals at drinking places. That a jackal should defeat the
lion is spoken of as a marvel.<sup>8</sup> The lion, being dangerous to
men,<sup>9</sup> was trapped,<sup>10</sup> lain in wait for in ambush,<sup>11</sup> or chased by
hunting bands.<sup>12</sup> But dogs were terrified of lions.<sup>13</sup> The
lioness ({%siṃhī%}) was also famous for her courage: the aid given
by Indra to {@Sudās@} against the vast host of his enemies is
compared to the defeat of a lioness by a ram ({@Petva@}).<sup>14</sup> The
gaping jaws of the lioness when attacking men are alluded to in
[Page2-449+ 43]
the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>15</sup> The lioness is also mentioned in
the Yajurveda Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas.<sup>16</sup> See also
