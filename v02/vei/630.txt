{@Kuṇḍṛṇācī@}¦ is the name of an animal of unknown character
occurring in the lists of victims at the horse sacrifice (Aśva-
medha) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās.<sup>1</sup> The word also occurs in
one passage of the Rigveda,<sup>2</sup> in which a bird would seem to be
intended, though Sāyaṇa interprets it as meaning ‘with
crooked flight’ ({%kuṭila-gatyā%}). In his commentary on the
Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>3</sup> he takes the word to denote the house-
lizard ({%gṛha-godhikā%}).
