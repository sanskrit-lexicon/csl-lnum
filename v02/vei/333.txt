{@Ugra@}¦ in one passage of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad<sup>1</sup> seems
to have a technical force, denoting ‘man in authority,’ or
according to Max Müller's rendering, ‘policeman.’ Roth<sup>2</sup>
compares a passage in the Rigveda,<sup>3</sup> where, however, the word
has simply the general sense of ‘mighty man.’ Böhtlingk,<sup>4</sup> in
his rendering of the Upaniṣad, treats the word as merely
adjectival.
