{@Vamraka@}¦ is mentioned in one passage of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> where
Roth<sup>2</sup> thinks that an ‘ant’ is meant. But Pischel,<sup>3</sup> with more
probability, thinks that it is a proper name, perhaps equivalent
to {@Vamra,@} and denoting the child of a maiden who was saved
from being devoured by ants.<sup>4</sup>
