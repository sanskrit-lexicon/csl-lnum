{@Praṣṭi,@}¦ like {@Pṛṣṭyā,@} denotes a ‘side horse,’ which, however,
possibly<sup>1</sup> did not necessarily mean a horse running beside the
yoke-horses, but may also have meant a third horse yoked in
front as a leader. This seems to be indicated by the reference
in the Rigveda<sup>2</sup> to the Praṣṭi — here applied to the Maruts’
team — leading ({%vahati%}) the team ({%rohitaḥ%}). In an obscure
passage of the Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> there is a reference to the Praṣṭis
in connexion with a {%pañca-vāhī,%} ‘drawn by five,’ but it is
impossible to gain any clear idea of what is meant. The
Praṣṭi is not rarely referred to elsewhere.<sup>4</sup> In one passage<sup>5</sup> the
{%dhuryau%} and the {%praṣṭyau%} are mentioned together; this probably
means the two horses yoked to the pole, with two others
fastened in some way one on each side. The adjectives {%praṣṭi-%}
{%mant,%}<sup>6</sup> {%praṣṭi-vāhana,%}<sup>7</sup> {%praṣṭi-vāhin,%}<sup>8</sup> are all used of {@Ratha,@} ‘chariot,’
meaning ‘drawn by a side horse (or horses)’ in addition to the
yoke-horses. {%Cf.%} {@Ratha.@}

{%praṣṭibhiḥ%} seems to refer to the assistants

by which a victory was won.</F>
