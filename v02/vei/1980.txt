{@Pra-tardana@}¦ is the name in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>1</sup> of a king
who had a {@Bharadvāja@} for his Purohita. In the Kauṣītaki
Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> he appears as arriving at the sacrifice of the Ṛṣis in
the Naimiṣa forest, and asking them how errors in the sacrifice
could be remedied; and as finding {@Alīkayu Vācaspata,@} the
Brahman priest at the sacrifice, unable to say what was to be
[Page2-030+ 35]
done. In the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad<sup>3</sup> it is said that Pratardana
Daivodāsi went to Indra's world through his death in battle.
The patronymic connects him with {@Divodāsa,@} the ancestor or
father of {@Sudās,@} and the mention of Bharadvāja (probably ‘a
Bharadvāja’ is meant) as his priest supports the patronymic,
for Divodāsa is a special favourite of the singers of the Bharad-
vāja family. The name, moreover, is reminiscent of the
Tṛtsus (the root {%tard%} appears in both) and of the {%Pratṛdaḥ%} (see
{@Pratṛd@}). But he is not in Vedic literature a king of Kāśi.<sup>4</sup>
Geldner<sup>5</sup> regards him as Divodāsa's son, but this is not likely.
