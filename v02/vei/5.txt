2. {@Akṣa.@}¦ — This word occurs frequently, from the Rigveda
onwards, both in the singular and plural, meaning ‘die’ and
‘dice.’ Dicing, along with horse-racing, was one of the main
amusements of the Vedic Indian; but, despite the frequent
mention of the game in the literature, there is considerable
difficulty in obtaining any clear picture of the mode in which it
was played.
<div n="P"/>(1) {%The Material.%} — The dice appear normally to have been
made of Vibhīdaka nuts. Such dice are alluded to in both the
Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and the Atharvaveda,<sup>2</sup> hence being called ‘brown’
({%babhru%}), and ‘born on a windy spot.’<sup>3</sup> In the ritual game of
dice at the Agnyādheya and the Rājasūya ceremonies the
material of the dice is not specified, but it is possible that
occasionally gold imitations of Vibhīdaka nuts were used.<sup>4</sup>
There is no clear trace in the Vedic literature of the later use
of cowries as dice.<sup>5</sup>
<div n="P"/>(2) {%The Number.%} — In the Rigveda<sup>6</sup> the dicer is described as
‘leader of a great horde’ ({%senānīr mahato gaṇasya%}), and in
another passage<sup>7</sup> the number is given as {%tri-pañcāśaḥ,%} an expres-
sion which has been variously interpreted. Ludwig,<sup>8</sup> Weber,<sup>9</sup>
and Zimmer<sup>10</sup> render it as fifteen, which is grammatically
hardly possible. Roth<sup>11</sup> and Grassmann<sup>12</sup> render it as ‘con-
sisting of fifty-three.’ Lüders<sup>13</sup> takes it as ‘consisting of one
hundred and fifty,’ but he points out that this may be merely a
vague expression for a large number. For a small number
Zimmer<sup>14</sup> cites a reference in the Rigveda<sup>15</sup> to one who fears
‘him who holds four’ ({%caturaś cid dadamānāt%}), but the sense of
that passage is dependent on the view taken of the method of
playing the game.
<div n="P"/>(3) {%The Method of Play.%} — In several passages of the later
[Page1-003+ 49]
Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas lists are given of expressions con-
nected with dicing. The names are Kṛta, Tretā, Dvāpara,
Āskanda, and Abhibhū in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā.<sup>16</sup> In the
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,<sup>17</sup> among the victims at the Puruṣamedha,
the {%kitava%} is offered to the Akṣarāja, the {%ādinava-darśa%} to the
Kṛta, the {%kalpin%} to the Tretā, the {%adhi-kalpin%} to the Dvāpara,
the {%sabhā-sthāṇu%} to the Āskanda. The lists in the parallel
version of the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa are {%kitava, sabhāvin, ādinava-%}
{%darśa, bahiḥ-sad,%} and {%sabhā-sthāṇu,%}<sup>18</sup> and Aksarāja, Kṛta, Tretā,
Dvāpara, and Kali. From the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>19</sup> it appears
that another name of Kali was Abhibhū, and the parallel lists
in the Taittirīya and Vājasaneyi Saṃhitās suggest that Abhibhū
and Akṣarāja are identical, though both appear in the late
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa list. The names of some of these throws
go back even to the Rigveda and the Atharvaveda. Kali occurs
in the latter,<sup>20</sup> and Lüders<sup>21</sup> shows that in a considerable number
of passages in the former Kṛta means a ‘throw’ (not ‘a stake’<sup>22</sup>
or ‘what is won’<sup>23</sup> and this sense is clearly found in the
Atharvaveda.<sup>24</sup> Moreover, that there were more throws ({%ayāḥ%})
than one is proved by a passage in the Rigveda,<sup>25</sup> when
the gods are compared to throws as giving or destroying
wealth.
<div n="P"/>The nature of the throws is obscure. The St. Petersburg
Dictionary conjectures that the names given above were applied
either to dice marked 4, 3, 2, or 1, or to the sides of the dice so
marked, and the latter interpretation is supported by some late
commentators.<sup>26</sup> But there is no evidence for the former
interpretation, and, as regards the latter, the shape of the
Vibhīdaka nuts,<sup>27</sup> used as dice, forbids any side being properly
on the top. Light is thrown on the expressions by the descrip-
[Page1-004+ 52]
tion of a ritual game<sup>28</sup> at the Agnyādheya and at the Rājasūya
ceremonies. The details are not certain,<sup>29</sup> but it is clear that
the game consisted in securing even numbers of dice, usually a
number divisible by four, the Kṛta, the other three throws then
being the Tretā, when three remained over after division by
four; the Dvāpara, when two was the remainder; and the Kali,
when one remained. If five were the dividing number, then the
throw which showed no remainder was Kali, the Kṛta was that
when four was left, and so on. The dice had no numerals
marked on them, the only question being what was the total
number of the dice themselves.
<div n="P"/>There is no reason to doubt that the game as played in the
Rigveda was based on the same principle, though the details
must remain doubtful. The number of dice used was certainly
large,<sup>30</sup> and the reference to throwing fours,<sup>31</sup> and losing by one,
points to the use of the Kṛta as the winning throw. The
Atharvaveda,<sup>32</sup> on the other hand, possibly knew of the Kali as
the winning throw. In one respect the ordinary game must
have differed from the ritual game. In the latter the players
merely pick out the number of dice required — no doubt to avoid
ominous errors, such as must have happened if a real game had
been played. In the secular game the dice were thrown,<sup>33</sup>
perhaps on the principle suggested by Lüders:<sup>34</sup> the one
throwing a certain number on the place of playing, and the other
then throwing a number to make up with those already thrown
a multiple of four or five. This theory, at any rate, accounts for
the later stress laid on the power of computation in a player,
as in the Nala.
<div n="P"/>No board appears to have been used, but a depression on which
[Page1-005+ 60]
the dice were thrown ({%adhi-devana, devana,%}<sup>35</sup> {%iriṇa%}<sup>36</sup> ), was made
in the ground. No dice box was used, but reference is made to
a case for keeping dice in ({%akṣa-vapana%}<sup>37</sup> The throw was called
{%graha%}<sup>38</sup> or earlier {%grābha.%}<sup>39</sup> The stake is called {%vij.%}<sup>40</sup> Serious
losses could be made at dicing: in the Rigveda a dicer laments
the loss of all his property, including his wife.<sup>41</sup> Lüders<sup>42</sup> finds
a different form of the game referred to in the Chāndogya
Upaniṣad.<sup>43</sup>
