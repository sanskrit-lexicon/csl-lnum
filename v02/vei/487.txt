{@Aurva,@}¦ ‘descendant of Uru or Urva,’ appears in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup>
in close connexion with {@Bhṛgu,@} being probably a Bhṛgu
himself. As in one passage of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>2</sup> the
descendants of Aitaśa are called the worst of the Aurvas, while
the parallel version of the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> calls them the
worst of the Bhṛgus, the Aurvas must have been a branch of
the larger family of the Bhṛgus. Aurva himself is said in the
Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>4</sup> to have received offspring from Atri. In
the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>5</sup> two Aurvas are referred to as
authorities. See also {@Kutsa.@}
