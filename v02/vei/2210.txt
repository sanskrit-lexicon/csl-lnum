{@Brahma-purohita@}¦ is found in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>1</sup> and the
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> where the St. Petersburg Dictionary
gives the sense as ‘having the priesthood as its Purohita.’
This seems rather doubtful; more probably the sense should be
‘having a Brahman priest as Purohita,’ unless the word merely
means ‘having the priesthood superior to it,’ as an epithet of
{@Kṣatra,@} the ‘warrior caste,’ which seems to be Weber's view.<sup>3</sup>
