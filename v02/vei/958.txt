{@Caraka@}¦ primarily denotes a ‘wandering student,’ a sense
actually found in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad.<sup>1</sup> More
especially it denotes the members of a school of the Black
Yajurveda, the practices of which are several times referred to
with disapproval in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>2</sup> In the Vāja-
saneyi Saṃhitā<sup>3</sup> the Caraka teacher ({%Carakācārya%}) is enumerated
among the sacrificial victims at the Puruṣamedha, or human
sacrifice. His dedication there to ill-doing is a clear hint of a
ritual feud.

to Taittirīya Saṃhitā vi. 3, 9, 6; 10, 2,

renders improbable von Schroeder's
view, {%Indiens Literatur und Cultur,%} 188,
that Caraka included all the Black
Yajurveda schools.
