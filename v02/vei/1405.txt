{@Dru-han,@}¦ ‘wood-cutter,’ seems to be meant by the word
{%druhantara%} in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> where it is usually taken as {%druhaṃ-%}
{%tara,%} ‘fiend-overpowering.’ But as an epithet of {%paraśu,%} ‘axe,’
the other sense (‘mighty wood-cutter’)<sup>2</sup> is more probable.<sup>3</sup>

<F>2) But if this explanation is correct,
the word should have the accentuation
of the comparative. See Oldenberg,
{%Sacred Books of the East,%} 46, 132.</F>
