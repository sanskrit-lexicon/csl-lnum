{@Viṣāṇin@}¦ occurs once in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as the name of a tribe in
the list of the enemies of the {@Tṛtsus,@} not as Roth<sup>2</sup> thought, of
their allies. The word seems to mean ‘having horns,’ but in what
sense is unknown; perhaps their helmets were horn-shaped or
ornamented with horns. They may, like their allies, the {@Alinas,@}
{@Bhalānas, Śivas,@} and {@Pakthas,@} be reckoned as belonging to the
tribes of the north-west.
