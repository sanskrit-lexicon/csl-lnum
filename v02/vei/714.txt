{@Keśa,@}¦ ‘hair of the head,’ is repeatedly mentioned in the later
Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas.<sup>1</sup> The hair was a matter of great
care to the Vedic Indian, and several hymns of the Atharva-
veda<sup>2</sup> are directed to securing its plentiful growth. Cutting
or shaving ({%vap%}) the hair is often referred to.<sup>3</sup> For a man to
wear long hair was considered effeminate.<sup>4</sup> As to modes of
dressing the hair see {@Opaśa@} and {@Kaparda;@} as to the beard see
