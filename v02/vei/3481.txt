{@Sabhā-cara@}¦ is one of the victims at the Puruṣamedha
(‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda.<sup>1</sup> The St. Petersburg
[Page2-428+ 33]
Dictionary thinks it is an adjective equivalent in sense to
{%sabhā-ga,%}’ ‘going to the assembly.’ As he is dedicated to
Dharma, ‘Justice,’ it is difficult not to see in him a member of
the Sabhā as a law court, perhaps as one of those who sit
to decide cases: there is nothing to show whether the whole
assembly did so, or only a chosen body. The special use of
Sabhācara suggests the latter alternative. See also {@Sabhāsad.@}
