{@Gotra@}¦ occurs several times in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> in the account of
the mythic exploits of Indra. Roth<sup>2</sup> interprets the word as
‘cowstall,’ while Geldner<sup>3</sup> thinks ‘herd’ is meant. The latter
sense seems to explain best the employment which the term
shows in the later literature as denoting the ‘family’ or ‘clan,’
and which is found in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Gṛhya Sūtras<sup>5</sup> stress is laid on the prohibition of
[Page1-236+ 55]
marriage within a Gotra, or with a Sapiṇḍa of the mother of
the bridegroom — that is to say, roughly, with agnates and
cognates. Senart<sup>6</sup> has emphasized this fact as a basis of caste,
on the ground that marriage within a {%curia, phratria,%} or caste
({@Varṇa@}) was Indo-European, as was marriage outside the circle
of agnates and cognates. But there is no evidence at all<sup>7</sup> to
prove that this practice was Indo-European, while in India the
Śatapatha<sup>8</sup> expressly recognizes marriage within the third or
fourth degree on either side. According to Sāyaṇa, the Kāṇvas
accepted marriage in the third degree, the Saurāṣṭras only in
the fourth, while the scholiast on the Vajrasūcī<sup>9</sup> adḍs to the
Kāṇvas the Andhras and the Dākṣiṇātyas, and remarks that
the Vājasaneyins forbade marriage with the daughter of the
mother's brother. All apparently allowed marriage with the
daughter of a paternal uncle, which later was quite excluded.
Change of Gotra was quite possible, as in the case of {@Śunaḥ-@}
{@śepa@} and {@Gṛtsamada,@} who, once an Aṅgirasa, became a
Bhārgava.<sup>10</sup>
