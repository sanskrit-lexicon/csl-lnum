{@Mudgala@}¦ and {@Mudgalanī,@} ‘Mudgala's wife,’ both figure in
a hopelessly obscure hymn of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> variously inter-
preted by Pischel<sup>2</sup> and Geldner<sup>3</sup> and von Bradke<sup>4</sup> as telling
of a real chariot race in which, despite difficulties, Mudgala
won by his wife's aid. The Indian tradition is as variant as
the interpretations of modern authorities. Ṣaḍguruśiṣya<sup>5</sup>
explains that Mudgala's oxen were stolen, that he pursued the
thieves with the one old ox he had left, and that hurling his
hammer ({%dru-ghaṇa%}) he caught the marauders. Yāska,<sup>6</sup> on the
other hand, says that Mudgala won a race with a {%drughaṇa%}
and an ox instead of with two oxen. It is pretty clear that,
as Roth<sup>7</sup> observed, the tradition is merely a guess, and a bad
one, at the meaning of an obscure hymn, and this view is
[Page2-167+ 55]
accepted by Oldenberg.<sup>8</sup> Bloomfield<sup>9</sup> has interpreted the
legend as one of heavenly, not of human, events. Mudgala,
probably a variant form of Mudgara,<sup>10</sup> which in the later
language means a hammer or a similar weapon, may be meant
as a personification of the thunderbolt of Indra, rather than
a real man.<sup>11</sup> Later<sup>12</sup> Mudgala is a mythical sage.

the name of Mudgalānī; but its sense,
