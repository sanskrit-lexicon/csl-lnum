{@Ā-śrama@}¦ (‘resting-place’) does not occur in any Upaniṣad
which can be regarded as pre-Buddhistic. Its earliest use as
denoting the stages of a Hindu's life is found in the Śvetāśvatara
Upaniṣad.<sup>1</sup> In one passage<sup>2</sup> of the Chāndogya Upaniṣad
reference is made only to the {@Brahmacārin@} and householder, to
whom, as a reward for study, the procreation of children, the
practice of Yoga, abstention from injury to living creatures,
and sacrifices, freedom from transmigration are promised. In
another place<sup>3</sup> three states are contemplated, but not as con-
secutive. The Brahmacārin may either become a householder
or become an anchorite, or remain in his teacher's house all his
life. Similarly, reference<sup>4</sup> is made to the death of the anchorite
in the forest, or the sacrifice in the village. In contrast with all
three<sup>5</sup> is the man who stands fast in Brahman (Brahma-
saṃstha). In the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad<sup>6</sup> the knower of the
Ātman is contrasted with those who (1) study, or (2) sacrifice
and give alms, or (3) are anchorites, and in another place<sup>7</sup> with
those who sacrifice and make benefactions, and those who
practice asceticism. This position of superiority to, and
distinction from, the Āśramas became later a fourth<sup>8</sup> Āśrama,

the {@Gṛhastha,@} or householder, who was in the second stage,
being required to pass not only into the stage of {@Vānaprastha,@}
but also that of the Sannyāsin ({@Bhikṣu, Parivrājaka@}). The
first stage, that of the {@Brahmacārin,@} was still obligatory, but
was no longer allowed to remain a permanent one, as was
originally possible.
