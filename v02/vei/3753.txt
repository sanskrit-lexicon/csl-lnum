1. {@Svadhiti@}¦ in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> denotes the ‘axe’ or ‘knife’
used for dissecting the sacrificial horse. In all the other
passages in that Saṃhitā<sup>2</sup> the sense of ‘axe’ for cutting wood
is adequate; reference is made in one place<sup>3</sup> to sharpening the
axe on the whetstone ({%kṣṇotra%}). In the Atharvaveda<sup>4</sup> the term
seems once to denote the copper ({%lohita%})<sup>5</sup> knife used to mark
the ears of cattle; the carpenter's knife or axe is also twice
referred to there.<sup>6</sup> Later the word means ‘axe’ generally.<sup>7</sup>
As a weapon it does not appear at all.<sup>8</sup>
