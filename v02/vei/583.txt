{@Kāmpīla.@}¦ — In one passage of the Yajurveda Saṃhitās<sup>1</sup> the
epithet Kāmpīla-vāsinī is applied to a woman, perhaps the
king's Mahiṣī or chief wife, whose duty it was to sleep beside
the slaughtered animal at the horse sacrifice (Aśvamedha).
The exact interpretation of the passage is very uncertain, but
both Weber<sup>2</sup> and Zimmer<sup>3</sup> agree in regarding Kāmpīla as the
name of the town known as Kāmpīlya in the later literature,
and the capital of Pañcāla in Madhyadeśa.
