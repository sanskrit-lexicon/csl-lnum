1. {@Indrota@}¦ is twice mentioned in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> in a Dānastuti
(‘Praise of Liberality’) as a giver of gifts. In the second passage
he has the epithet Ātithigva, which shows conclusively that he
was a son of Atithigva, as Ludwig<sup>2</sup> holds, and not of Ṛkṣa, as
Roth<sup>3</sup> states.
