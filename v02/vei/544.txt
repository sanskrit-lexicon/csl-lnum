{@Kavaca@}¦ denotes a ‘corselet’ or ‘breastplate’ in the Atharva-
veda<sup>1</sup> and later.<sup>2</sup> There is nothing to show whether it was
made of metal, but that it was so is quite possible (see
{@Varman@}). The Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> refers to a ‘corselet-strap’
({%kavaca-pāśa%}), which may point to a linen corselet such as those
known to Herodotus.<sup>4</sup>
