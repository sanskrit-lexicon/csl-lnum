{@Vājapeya@}¦ is the name of a ceremony which, according to
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> and later authorities,<sup>2</sup> is only per-
formed by a Brahmin or a Kṣatriya. The same Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup>
insists that this sacrifice is superior to the {@Rājasūya,@} but the
consensus of other authorities<sup>4</sup> assigns to it merely the place
of a preliminary to the {@Bṛhaspatisava@} in the case of a priest,
and to the {@Rājasūya@} in the case of a king, while the Śatapatha<sup>5</sup>
is compelled to identify the Bṛhaspatisava with the Vājapeya.
The essential ceremony is a chariot race in which the sacrificer
is victorious. There is evidence in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta
Sūtra<sup>6</sup> showing that once the festival was one which any
Āryan could perform. Hillebrandt,<sup>7</sup> indeed, goes so far as to
compare it with the Olympic games; but there is hardly much
real ground for this: the rite seems to have been developed
round a primitive habit of chariot racing, transformed into
a ceremony which by sympathetic magic secures the success
of the sacrificer. In fact<sup>8</sup> Eggeling seems correct in holding
that the Vājapeya was a preliminary rite performed by a
Brahmin prior to his formal installation as a Purohita, or by
a king prior to his consecration. The Kuru Vājapeya was
specially well known.<sup>9</sup>
