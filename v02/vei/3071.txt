{@Vaitahavya,@}¦ ‘descendant of {@Vītahavya,@}’ is the name of a
family who are said in the Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> to have come to ruin
because they devoured a Brahmin's cow. They are said to be
{@Sṛñjayas,@} but as the exact form of the legend here referred to
does not occur elsewhere, its authenticity is open to some
doubt.<sup>2</sup> According to Zimmer,<sup>3</sup> Vaitahavya is a mere epithet
of the Sṛñjayas, but this is not probable<sup>4</sup> in view of the
existence of a Vītahavya.
