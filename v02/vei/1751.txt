{@Pastyā@}¦ (fem. pl.) is a word occurring in several passages of
the Rigveda.<sup>1</sup> Roth<sup>2</sup> ascribes to it the meaning of ‘house’ or
‘dwelling,’ in the wide sense of the term, as well as that of the
‘family’ living in the house; and this view is accepted by
Zimmer.<sup>3</sup> On the other hand, Pischel<sup>4</sup> finds in two of the
passages<sup>5</sup> usually referred to Pastyā the neuter Pastya, which
appears in {@Pastya-sad@} and in {@Pastyā-vant@} (where the length
of the second syllable is not primitive), and which is certainly
found in the Rigveda<sup>6</sup> in the metaphorical sense of ‘dwelling,’
ascribed to it in the Naighaṇṭuka.<sup>7</sup> In the other passages<sup>8</sup> he
thinks the word means ‘rivers’ or ‘waters’; in particular,
where Soma in the middle of the Pastyās<sup>9</sup> is spoken of, the
sees a reference to {@Kurukṣetra,@} with its several rivers,<sup>10</sup> {@Āpayā,@}
{@Dṛṣadvatī,@} and {@Sarasvatī@} ({%cf.%} 2. {@Pastyāvant@}). In some passages<sup>11</sup>
he sees in Pastyā the proper name of a stream, just as Sindhu
primarily means ‘river,’ then the ‘Indus.’
