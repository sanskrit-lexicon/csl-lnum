the ordinary warrior as opposed to the charioteer, and the
[Page2-169+ 48]
‘fight’ itself. So also in the Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> the charioteer
({%rathin%}) is opposed to the foot-soldier ({%patti%}), and in the
Rigveda<sup>4</sup> the chariots are opposed to the troops ({%grāma%}) of the
infantry. The parallel of the Greek and other Āryan races
shows that the Kṣatriyas were the fighters from chariots, while
the ordinary host fought on foot.
