{@Rāja-kartṛ,@}¦<sup>1</sup> or {@Rāja-kṛt,@}<sup>2</sup> ‘king-maker,’ is the term applied
in the Atharvaveda and the Brāhmaṇas to those who, ‘not
themselves kings,’<sup>3</sup> aid in the consecration of the king. In the
Śatapatha<sup>2</sup> the persons meant and specified are the {@Sūta,@}
‘charioteer,’ and the {@Grāmaṇī,@} ‘village chief,’ probably a repre-
sentative chief from the village nearest to the place of consecra-
tion, as Eggeling<sup>4</sup> suggests. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>1</sup>
according to the commentator's explanation, the father,
brother, etc., are meant; in the Atharvaveda,<sup>2</sup> also, the
meaning of the expression is not stated in the text.
