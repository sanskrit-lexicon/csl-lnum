{@Bali@}¦ occurs several times in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and often later<sup>2</sup>
in the sense of tribute to a king or offering to a god. Zimmer<sup>3</sup>
thinks that the offerings were in both cases voluntary. He
compares the notices of the Germans in Tacitus,<sup>4</sup> where the
kings of the tribes are said to receive gifts in kind as presents,
but not a regular tribute. There seems to be no ground what-
ever for this view. No doubt in origin the prerogatives of
monarchy were due to voluntary action on the part of the
tribesmen,<sup>5</sup> but that the Vedic peoples, who were essentially
a body of conquering invaders, were in this state is most
improbable, and the attitude of the Vedic Indian to his gods
was at least as compatible with tribute as with voluntary gifts.
Zimmer admits that in the case of hostile tribes<sup>6</sup> tribute must
be meant even in the Rigveda. See also {@Rājan.@}
