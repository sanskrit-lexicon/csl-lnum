{@Kakuha,@}¦ a word occurring several times in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> is
understood by Roth<sup>2</sup> to designate part of a chariot, perhaps the
seat. Ludwig,<sup>3</sup> again, regards it in one passage<sup>4</sup> as the proper
name of a Yādava prince who took spoil from {@Tirindira,@} the
{@Parśu,@} but this view is hardly probable.<sup>5</sup> It is, on the whole,
most likely that the word always means ‘chief,’ ‘pre-eminent,’
being applied as an epithet to horses, chariots, princes, etc.<sup>6</sup>
This is the only sense given by Grassmann,<sup>7</sup> and later adopted
by Roth.<sup>8</sup>
