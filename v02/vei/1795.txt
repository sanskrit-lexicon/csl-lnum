{@Pārthava,@}¦ ‘descendant of {@Pṛthu,@}’ occurs once in the Rig-
veda,<sup>1</sup> where the Pārthavas are mentioned as generous donors.
The passage is somewhat obscure, as there is a reference<sup>2</sup> to a
defeat of the {@Turvaśas@} and the {@Vṛcīvants@} by {@Sṛñjaya Daiva-@}
{@vāta,@} followed in the next verse by the praise of the bounty to
the singer of {@Abhyāvartin Cāyamāna,@} who was clearly a
{@Pārthava,@} and who, in the earlier part of the hymn, has been
referred to as victorious over {@Varaśikha.@} It is uncertain
whether, as Zimmer<sup>3</sup> suggests, the two princes, Abhyāvartin
[Page1-522+ 34]
Cāyamāna and Sṛñjaya Daivavāta, are identical or not.<sup>4</sup> That
Pārthava has any direct connexion with the Parthians, as held
by Brunnhofer, is most improbable.<sup>5</sup> {%Cf.%} {@Parśu.@}
