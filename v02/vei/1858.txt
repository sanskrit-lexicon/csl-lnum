{@Punaḥ-sara,@}¦ ‘recurrent,’ is the epithet of the barking dog in
the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> which is told to bark at the thief. It refers, not
doubt, to the dog's practice of running to and fro when it
barks. It is also applied to a plant, {@Apāmārga@} ({%Achyranthes%}
{%aspera%}), in the Atharvaveda,<sup>2</sup> with the sense of ‘having revertent
leaves.’
