{@Adhi-rāja.@}¦ — The word occurs fairly often throughout the
early literature,<sup>1</sup> denoting ‘overlord’ among kings or princes.
[Page1-020+ 47]
In no passage is it clear that a real over-king is meant, as
the word {%rājan%} may mean king or merely prince, a person of
royal blood. On the whole it seems most probable that the
word connotes no more than ‘king’ as opposed to ‘prince.’
