{@Petva@}¦ is found twice in the Atharvaveda.<sup>1</sup> In the first
passage reference is made to its {%vāja,%} which Zimmer<sup>2</sup> argues
can only mean ‘strength,’ ‘swiftness,’ though naturally the
sense of ‘male power’ would seem more appropriate in a spell
intended to remove lack of virility. In the second passage the
Petva is mentioned as overcoming the horse (see {@Ubhayādant@}),
a miracle which has a parallel in the Rigveda,<sup>3</sup> where the
Petva overcomes the female<sup>4</sup> lion. The animal also occurs in
the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the
Yajurveda Saṃhitās,<sup>5</sup> and occasionally elsewhere.<sup>6</sup> It appears
to be the ‘ram’ or the ‘wether,’ the latter<sup>7</sup> being the sense
given to it by the commentator on the Taittirīya Saṃhitā.
But there is no conclusive evidence in favour of this meaning,
while on the whole the passage of the Atharvaveda, in which
{%vāja%} is found, accords best with the sense of ‘ram.’ Hopkins,<sup>8</sup>
however, renders the word as ‘goat,’ though for what reason is
not clear. Whether it is connected in any way with {@Pitva@} or
{@Pidva@} is quite uncertain.

{%Journal of the American Oriental Society,%}

a play on {%śiṃyum,%} the name of one of
the kings or peoples defeated in the
battle of the ten kings. But, admitting
the play, {%siṃhī%} as fem. seems to be still
more pointed than {%siṃha,%} contrasting
with the masculine {%petva.%}</F>

‘goat’ in connexion with v. 19, 2.</F>
