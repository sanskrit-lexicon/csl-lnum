{@Paṇi@}¦ in the Rigveda appears to denote a person who is
rich, but who does not give offerings to the gods, or bestow
{@Dakṣiṇās@} on the priests, and who is therefore an object of
intense dislike to the composers of the Saṃhitā.<sup>1</sup> Hence the
gods are asked to attack the Paṇis, who are also referred to
as being defeated with slaughter.<sup>2</sup> The Paṇi is opposed to the
pious sacrificer as a niggard,<sup>3</sup> and is spoken of as a wolf,<sup>4</sup> the
symbol of enmity. In some passages<sup>5</sup> the Paṇis definitely
appear as mythological figures, demons who withhold the cows
or waters of heaven, and to whom Saramā goes on a mission
from Indra.<sup>6</sup> Among the Paṇis {@Bṛbu@} was apparently important.
In one passage of the Rigveda<sup>7</sup> they are described as {@Beka-@}
{@nāṭas,@} or ‘usurers’ (?). In another<sup>8</sup> they are called {@Dasyus,@}
and styled {%mṛdhra-vāc,%} probably ‘of hostile speech,’ and {%grathin,%}
a word of uncertain meaning. Hillebrandt<sup>9</sup> thinks that the
latter epithet refers to the continuous flow of a speech which
[Page1-472+ 54]
is not understood, and that {%mṛdhra-vāc%} means ‘śpeaking an
enemy's speech,’ though not necessarily with reference to
non-Āryans.<sup>10</sup> In two passages<sup>11</sup> the Paṇis appear as {@Dāsas,@}
and in one<sup>12</sup> a Paṇi is mentioned in connexion with wer-
geld ({@Vaira@}), being apparently regarded as equal to a man
merely in the price put on his life, but in other respects as
inferior.
<div n="P"/>It is difficult to be certain exactly who a Paṇi was. Roth<sup>13</sup>
thinks that the word is derived from {%paṇ,%} ‘barter,’ and that
the Paṇi is properly the man who will give nothing without
return, hence the niggard, who neither worships the gods nor
rewards their priests. This view is accepted by Zimmer<sup>14</sup> and
by Ludwig.<sup>15</sup> The latter scholar thinks the apparent references
to fights with Paṇis are to be explained by their having been
aboriginal traders who went in caravans — as in Arabia and
Northern Africa — prepared to fight, if need be, to protect their
goods against attacks which the Āryans would naturally deem
quite justified. He supports this explanation by the references
to the Paṇis as Dasyus and Dāsas. It is, however, hardly
necessary to do more than regard the Paṇis generally as
non-worshippers of the gods favoured by the singers; the term
is wide enough to cover either the aborigines or hostile Āryan
tribes, as well as demons. Hillebrandt,<sup>16</sup> however, thinks that
a real tribe is meant, the Parnians of Strabo, and that they
were associated with the Dahae ({@Dāsa@}). Moreover, he finds
them associated in one passage<sup>17</sup> with the {@Pārāvatas,@} whom
[Page1-473+ 45]
he identifies with the <lang n="greek">Παρουῆται</lang> of Ptolemy,<sup>18</sup> and with {@Bṛṣaya,@}
whom he connects with <lang n="greek">Βαρσαέντης</lang> of Arrian;<sup>19</sup> he also con-
siders that the frequent<sup>20</sup> mention of the Paṇis as opponents
of {@Divodāsa@} shows that the latter was on the Arachosian
Haraqaiti ({@Sarasvatī@}) fighting against the Parnians and Dahae,
as well as other Iranian tribes. But the identification of Paṇi
and the Parnians is needless, especially as the root {%paṇ,%} which
is found also in the Greek <lang n="greek">πέρνημι</lang>, shows a satisfactory deri-
vation, while the transfer of Divodāsa to the Haraqaiti is
improbable. See also {@Divodāsa@} and {@Bekanāṭa.@}
