1. {@Mandhātṛ@}¦ occurs in several passages of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> in
all of which Roth<sup>2</sup> takes the word as merely an adjective used
substantively, ‘the pious man.’ In one passage<sup>3</sup> the word,
being applied to Agni, is thus used, but in another<sup>4</sup> {%Mandhātṛvat%}
being parallel with {%Aṅgirasvat,%} ‘like Aṅgiras,’ is naturally to be
understood as a proper name, which is probably also the sense
of the word in the preceding hymn.<sup>5</sup> A different Mandhātṛ<sup>6</sup>
may be meant in the first Maṇḍala,<sup>6</sup> where he is mentioned as
a protégé of the Aśvins, and evidently as a king. To equate
these persons, and make a Rājarṣi out of Mandhātṛ, as Ludwig<sup>7</sup>
and Griffith<sup>8</sup> do, is unnecessary and improbable.
