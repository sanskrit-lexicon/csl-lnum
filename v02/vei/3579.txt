{@Sīra,@}¦ ‘plough,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> and often later.<sup>2</sup>
It was large and heavy, as is shown by the fact that six oxen,<sup>3</sup>
or eight,<sup>4</sup> or twelve,<sup>5</sup> or even twenty-four,<sup>6</sup> were used to drag it.
The animals which drew the plough were oxen, which were, no
doubt, yoked and harnessed with traces.<sup>7</sup> The ox was guided
by the {@Aṣṭrā,@} or ‘goad,’ of the ploughman ({%cf.%} {@Vaiśya@}).<sup>8</sup> Little
is known of the parts of the plough. See {@Lāṅgala@} and {@Phāla.@}
