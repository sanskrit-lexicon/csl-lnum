{@Ā-śir@}¦ (‘admixture’) denotes the mixing, and more especially
the milk mixed with the juice, of the Soma before it was
offered to the gods. In this sense it is not rare from the
Rigveda<sup>1</sup> onwards. Not milk alone was employed for this
purpose. The epithet ‘having three admixtures’ applied to
Soma<sup>2</sup> is explained by the other epithets, ‘mixed with milk’
({%gavāśir%}), ‘mixed with curds’ ({%dadhy-āśir%}), and ‘mixed with
grain’ ({%yavāśir%}) — all referring to Soma.
