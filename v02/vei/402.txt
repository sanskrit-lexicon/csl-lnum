{@Uśīnara@}¦ — In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇā<sup>1</sup> the Kuru-Pañcālas are
mentioned as dwelling together in the ‘Middle Country’ with
the Vaśas and the Uśīnaras. In the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad<sup>2</sup> also
the Uśīnaras are associated with the Kuru-Pañcālas and Vaśas,
but in the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> the Uśīnaras and Vaśas are re-
garded as northerners. In the Rigveda<sup>4</sup> the people is alluded to
in one passage by reference to their queen, Uśīnarāṇī. Zimmer<sup>5</sup>
thinks that the Uśīnaras earlier lived farther to the north-west,
but for this there is no clear evidence. His theory is based
merely on the fact that the Anukramaṇī (Index) of the Rigveda
ascribes one hymn<sup>6</sup> to Śibi Auśīnara, and that the Śibis were
known to Alexander's followers as <lang n="greek">Σίβοι</lang>,<sup>7</sup> living between the
Indus and the Akesines (Chenab). But this is in no way
conclusive, as the Śibis, at any rate in Epic times,<sup>8</sup> occupied
the land to the north of Kurukṣetra, and there is no reason
whatever to show that in the Vedic period the Uśīnaras were
farther west than the ‘Middle Country.’
