{@Pra-dhi@}¦ is the name of some part of the wheel of a chariot,
probably the ‘felly.’ In one passage of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> and in
one of the Atharvaveda,<sup>2</sup> the ‘nave’ ({@Nabhya@}) and the ‘felly’
({%pradhi%}) are mentioned along with the {@Upadhi,@} which must then
be either a collective name for the spokes or an inner rim within
the felly and binding the spokes. In the riddle hymn of the
Rigveda<sup>3</sup> twelve Pradhis are mentioned with three naves, one
wheel, and three hundred and sixty spokes; what exactly is
here meant by this particular term it would be useless to con-
jecture, though it is clear that the passage as a whole symbolizes

the year with three seasons, twelve months, and three hundred
and sixty days. Elsewhere<sup>4</sup> the nave and the Pradhi alone are
mentioned, or the Pradhi occurs by itself.<sup>5</sup>
