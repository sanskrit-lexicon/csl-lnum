1. {@Rājan,@}¦ ‘king,’ is a term repeatedly occurring in the Rig-
veda<sup>1</sup> and the later literature.<sup>2</sup> It is quite clear that the
normal, though not universal form of government, in early
India was that by kings, as might be expected in view of the
fact that the Āryan Indians were invaders in a hostile territory:
a situation which, as in the case of the Āryan invaders of
Greece and of the German invaders of England, resulted almost
necessarily in strengthening the monarchic element of the
constitution.<sup>3</sup> The mere patriarchal organization of society
is not sufficient, as Zimmer<sup>4</sup> assumes, to explain the Vedic
kingship.
[Page2-211+ 53]
<div n="P"/>{%Tenure of Monarchy.%} — Zimmer<sup>5</sup> is of opinion that while the
Vedic monarchy was sometimes hereditary, as is indeed shown
by several cases where the descent can be traced,<sup>6</sup> yet in others
the monarchy was elective, though it is not clear whether the
selection by the people was between the members of the royal
family only or extended to members of all the noble clans. It
must, however, be admitted that the evidence for the elective
monarchy is not strong. As Geldner<sup>7</sup> argues, all the passages
cited<sup>8</sup> can be regarded not as choice by the cantons ({@Viś@}), but
as acceptance by the subjects ({%viś%}): this seems the more prob-
able sense. Of course this is no proof that the monarchy was
not sometimes elective: the practice of selecting one member
of the family to the exclusion of another less well qualified is
exemplified by the legend in Yāska<sup>9</sup> of the Kuru brothers,
{@Devāpi@} and {@Śantanu,@} the value of which, as evidence of
contemporary views, is not seriously affected by the legend
itself being of dubious character and validity.
<div n="P"/>Royal power was clearly insecure: there are several references
to kings being expelled from their realms, and their efforts to
recover their sovereignty,<sup>10</sup> and the Atharvaveda contains spells
in the interest of royalty.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%The King in War.%} — Naturally the Vedic texts, after the Rig-
veda, contain few notices of the warlike adventures that no
doubt formed a very considerable proportion of the royal
functions. But the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>12</sup> contains the state-
ment that the {@Kuru-Pañcāla@} kings, who, like the Brahmins of
[Page2-212+ 71]
those tribes, stand as representatives of good form, used to
make their raids in the dewy season. The word {@Udāja,@} too,
with its variant Nirāja, records that kings took a share of the
booty of war. The Rigveda<sup>13</sup> has many references to Vedic
wars: it is clear that the Kṣatriyas were at least as intent on
fulfilling their duty of war as the Brahmins on sacrificing and
their other functions. Moreover, beside offensive war, defence
was a chief duty of the king: he is emphatically the ‘protector
of the tribe’ ({%gopā janasya%}), or, as is said in the {@Rājasūya@}
(‘royal consecration’), ‘protector of the Brahmin.’<sup>14</sup> His
{@Purohita@} was expected to use his spells and charms to secure
the success of his king's arms. The king no doubt fought in
person: so {@Pratardana@} met death in war according to the
Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad;<sup>15</sup> and in the Rājasūya the king is invoked
as ‘sacker of cities’ ({%purāṃ bhettā%}).
<div n="P"/>{%The King in Peace.%} — In return for his warlike services the
king received the obedience<sup>16</sup> — sometimes forced<sup>17</sup> — of the
people, and in particular their contributions for the mainten-
ance of royalty. The king is regularly<sup>18</sup> regarded as ‘devouring
[Page2-213+ 50]
the people,’ but this phrase must not be explained as meaning that
he necessarily oppressed them. It obviously has its origin in a
custom by which the king and his retinue were fed by the
people's contributions, a plan with many parallels. It is also
probable that the king could assign the royal right of mainten-
ance to a Kṣatriya, thus developing a nobility supported by the
people. Taxation would not normally fall on Kṣatriya or
Brahmin; the texts contain emphatic assertions of the exemp-
tion of the goods of the latter from the royal bounty.<sup>19</sup>In
the people, however, lay the strength of the king.<sup>20</sup> See also
{@Bali.@}
<div n="P"/>In return the king performed the duties of judge. Himself
immune from punishment ({%a-daṇḍya%}), he wields the rod of
punishment ({@Daṇḍa@}).<sup>21</sup> It is probable that criminal justice
remained largely in his actual administration, for the Sūtras<sup>22</sup>
preserve clear traces of the personal exercise of royal criminal
jurisdiction. Possibly the jurisdiction could be exercised by a
royal officer, or even by a delegate, for a Rājanya is mentioned
as an overseer ({%adhyakṣa%}) of the punishment of a Śūdra in the
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā.<sup>23</sup> In civil justice it may be that the king
played a much less prominent part, save as a court of final
appeal, but evidence is lacking on this head. The {@Madhyamaśī@}
of the Rigveda was probably not a royal, but a private
judge or arbitrator. A wide criminal jurisdiction is, how-
ever, to some extent supported<sup>24</sup> by the frequent mention of
Varuṇa's spies, for Varuṇa is the divine counterpart of the
human king.<sup>25</sup> Possibly such spies could be used in war
also.<sup>26</sup>
<div n="P"/>There is no reference in early Vedic literature to the exercise
of legislative activity by the king, though later it is an essential
[Page2-214+ 52]
part of his duties.<sup>27</sup> Nor can we say exactly what executive
functions devolved on the king.
<div n="P"/>In all his acts the king was regularly advised by his {@Puro-@}
{@hita;@} he also had the advantage of the advice of the royal
ministers and attendants (see {@Ratnin@}). The local administra-
tion was entrusted to the {@Grāmaṇī,@} or village chief, who may
have been selected or appointed by the king. The outward signs
of the king's rank were his palace<sup>28</sup> and his brilliant dress.<sup>29</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%The King as Landowner.%} — The position of the king with
regard to the land is somewhat obscure. The Greek notices,<sup>30</sup>
in which, unhappily, it would be dangerous to put much trust,
since they were collected by observers who were probably little
used to accurate investigations of such matters, and whose
statements were based on inadequate information, vary in their
statements. In part they speak of rent being paid, and declare
that only the king and no private person could own land, while
in part they refer to the taxation of land. Hopkins<sup>31</sup> is strongly
of opinion that the payments made were paid for protection
-{%i.e.,%} in modern terminology as a tax, but that the king was
recognized as the owner of all the land, while yet the individual
or the joint family also owned the land. As against Baden-
Powell,<sup>32</sup> who asserted that the idea of the king as a landowner
was later, he urges for the Vedic period that the king, as we
have seen, is described as devouring the people, and that,
according to the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>33</sup> the {@Vaiśya@} can be
devoured at will and maltreated (but, unlike the {@Śūdra,@} not
killed); and for the period of the legal Sūtras and Śāstras he
cites Bṛhaspati and Nārada as clearly recognizing the king's
overlordship, besides a passage of the Mānava Dharma Śāstra<sup>34</sup>
which describes the king as ‘lord of all,’ a phrase which
[Page2-215+ 59]
Bühler<sup>35</sup> was inclined to interpret as a proof of landowning.
The evidence is, however, inadequate to prove what is sought.
It is not denied that gradually the king came to be vaguely con-
ceived — as the English king still is — as lord of all the land in a
proprietorial sense, but it is far more probable that such an idea
was only a gradual development than that it was primitive.
The power of devouring the people is a political power, not a
right of ownership; precisely the same feature can be traced in
South Africa,<sup>36</sup> where the chief can deprive a man arbitrarily of
his land, though the land is really owned by the native. The
matter is ultimately to some extent one of terminology, but the
parallel cases are in favour of distinguishing between the
political rights of the crown, which can be transferred by way
of a grant, and the rights of ownership. Hopkins<sup>37</sup> thinks
that the gifts of land to priests, which seems to be the first
sign of land transactions in the Brāhmaṇas, was an actual gift
of land; it may have been so in many cases, but it may easily
also have been the grant of a superiority: the Epic grants are
hardly decisive one way or the other.

to this form of taxation that the share
