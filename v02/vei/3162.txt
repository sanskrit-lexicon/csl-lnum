{@Śapatha@}¦ in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later<sup>2</sup> denotes a ‘curse,’ not an
‘oath,’ as a judicial process. But that an oath of such a kind
was possible as it was later,<sup>2</sup> is shown by at least one passage
of the Rigveda,<sup>3</sup> where the speaker, possibly {@Vasiṣṭha,@} impre-
cates death on himself if he is a wizard, and death on his foes if
he is not.
