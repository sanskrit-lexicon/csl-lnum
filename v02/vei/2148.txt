2. {@Balhika Prātipīya@}¦ is the name of a {@Kuru@} king in the
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>1</sup> where he appears as having been opposed
to the restoration of {@Duṣṭarītu Pauṃsāyana@} to his hereditary
sovereignty over the {@Sṛñjayas,@} but as having failed to prevent
[Page2-064+ 49]
the restoration being carried out by {@Revottaras Pāṭava Cākra@}
{@Sthapati.@} The epithet Prātipīya is curious: if it connects him
with {@Pratīpa@} (whose son he is in the Epic), the form is
remarkable, Zimmer<sup>2</sup> indeed tacitly altering it to Prātīpīya.
In the Epic and the Purāṇas<sup>3</sup> he is in the form of Vāhlīka
made a brother of {@Devāpi@} and {@Śantanu,@} and a son of Pratīpa.
To base chronological conclusions on this<sup>4</sup> would be utterly
misleading, for the facts are that Devāpi was son of Ṛṣṭiṣeṇa
and a priest, while Śantanu was a Kuru prince of unknown
parentage, but not probably a son of Pratīpa, who seems to be
a late figure in the Vedic age, later than {@Parikṣit,@} being his
great-grandson in the Epic. Very possibly Balhika was a
descendant of Pratīpa. Why he bore the name Balhika
must remain uncertain, for there is no evidence of any sort
regarding it.
