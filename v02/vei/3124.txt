{@Śaka-dhūma@}¦ is found in one hymn of the Atharvaveda,<sup>1</sup>
where it is celebrated as the king of the asterisms. The word
seems to mean the ‘smoke of (burning) cow-dung,’ or else the
‘smoke (rising) from (fresh) cow-dung’: it may well be, as
Weber<sup>2</sup> thinks, that this was deemed to be significant of the
weather. Bloomfield,<sup>3</sup> however, considers that the word is to
be rendered as ‘weather prophet,’ that is, one who foretells the
weather by means of the smoke of a fire. Whitney<sup>4</sup> objects to
this view with reason. It is not at all improbable that, as
Roth<sup>5</sup> believed, an asterism of some sort is meant, probably
the ‘milky way.’
