{@Kṛśana,@}¦ ‘pearl.’ In the Rigveda pearls are mentioned as
adorning the car of Savitṛ<sup>1</sup> as well as being used for the adorn-
ment of a horse.<sup>2</sup> Hence the horse is spoken of as the ‘pearled
one’ ({%kṛśanāvant%}).<sup>3</sup> The Atharvaveda<sup>4</sup> also refers to pearls, and
mentions that ‘pearl shell’ ({%śañkhaḥ kṛśanaḥ%}) won from the sea was
used as an amulet.<sup>5</sup> The Nighaṇṭu<sup>6</sup> renders the word as ‘gold.’
