{@Tugrya@}¦ occurs in the Rigveda as a patronymic of {@Bhujyu,@}<sup>1</sup>
but also in a passage<sup>2</sup> in which no reference to Bhujyu appears
to be meant, and in which it may mean ‘a man of the house
of Tugra.’ A similar sense seems to occur in the locative
plural feminine in the Rigveda,<sup>3</sup> where (supplying {%vikṣu%}) the
meaning must be ‘among the Tugrians.’ This explanation
may also apply to the epithet of Indra<sup>4</sup> or Soma,<sup>5</sup> {%tugryā-vṛdh,%}
‘rejoicing among the Tugrians.’

Indra.
