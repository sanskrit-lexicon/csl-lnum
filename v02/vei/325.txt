{@Iṣu@}¦ is the usual name for ‘arrow’ from the Rigveda<sup>1</sup>
onwards. Other names are {@Śarya, Śārī,@} and {@Bāṇa.@} In the
hymn of the Rigveda,<sup>2</sup> which gives a catalogue of armour,
two kinds of arrows are distinctly referred to: the one is
poisoned ({%ālāktā%}), and has a head of horn ({%ruru-śīrṣṇī%}); the
other is copper-, bronze-, or iron-headed ({%ayo-mukham%}). Poisoned
({%digdhā%}) arrows are also referred to in the Atharvaveda.<sup>3</sup> The
arrows were feathered.<sup>4</sup> The parts of an arrow are enumerated
in the Atharvaveda<sup>5</sup> as the shaft ({%śalya%}), the feather-socket
({%parṇa-dhi%}), the point ({%śṛṅga%}), the neck of the point in which
the shaft is fixed ({%kulmala%}), and the {@Apaskambha@} and {@Apāṣṭha,@}
which are of more doubtful significance. In the Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa<sup>6</sup> the parts of an arrow are given as the point ({%anīka%}),
the {%śalya, tejana,%} and the feathers ({%parṇāni%}), where {%śalya%} and
{%tejana%} must apparently mean the upper and lower parts of the
shaft, since it is reasonable to suppose that the arrow is
described as a whole consecutively. So in the Atharvaveda<sup>7</sup>
the arrow of Kāma is described as having feathers, a shaft
[Page1-082+ 56]
({%śalya%}), and a firm fastening ({%kulmala%}).<sup>8</sup> The arrow was shot
from the ear, and so is described in the Rigveda<sup>9</sup> as ‘having
the ear for its place of birth.’
<div n="P"/>As a measure of length, the Iṣu was five spans, say three feet.<sup>10</sup>
A regular profession of arrow-making existed ({%iṣu-kṛt,%}<sup>11</sup> {%iṣu-kāra%}).<sup>12</sup>
