{@Puru-kutsa@}¦ is the name of a king who is mentioned several
times in the Rigveda. In one passage<sup>1</sup> he is mentioned as a
contemporary of {@Sudās,@} but whether as a foe, according to
Ludwig,<sup>2</sup> or merely as a contemporary, according to Hille-
brandt,<sup>3</sup> is uncertain. In two other passages<sup>4</sup> he is mentioned
as victorious by divine favour, and in another<sup>5</sup> he appears as a
king of the {@Pūrus@} and a conqueror of the {@Dāsas.@} His son was
{@Trasadasyu,@}<sup>6</sup> who is accordingly called {@Paurukutsya@}<sup>7</sup> or
{@Paurukutsi.@}<sup>8</sup> Different conclusions have been drawn from one
hymn of the Rigveda<sup>9</sup> in which the birth of Purukutsa's son,
[Page1-542+ 44]
Trasadasyu, is mentioned. The usual interpretation is that
Purukutsa was killed in battle or captured, whereupon his
wife secured a son to restore the fortunes of the Pūrus. But
Sieg<sup>10</sup> offers a completely different interpretation. According
to him the word {@daurgahe,@} which occurs in the hymn, and
which in the ordinary view is rendered ‘descendant of Durgaha,’
an ancestor of Purukutsa, is the name of a horse, the hymn
recording the success of an Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’)
undertaken by Purukutsa for his wife, as by kings in later
times, to secure a son. This interpretation is supported by the
version of {%daurgahe%} given in the Śatapatha,<sup>11</sup> but is by no
means certain. Moreover, if Purukutsa was a contemporary of
Sudās, the defeat of the Pūrus by Sudās in the {@Dāśarājña@}<sup>12</sup>
might well have been the cause of the troubles from which
{@Purukutsānī,@} by the birth of Trasadasyu, rescued the family.
In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>13</sup> Purukutsa is called an Aikṣvāka.
