{@Vrīhi,@}¦ ‘rice,’ is never mentioned in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> but is
frequently alluded to in the Atharvaveda<sup>2</sup> and later.<sup>3</sup> Rice
seems to be indigenous in the south-east of India:<sup>4</sup> this fact
accounts well for the absence of any mention of it in the
Rigveda. Black and white rice is contrasted in the Taittirīya
Saṃhitā,<sup>5</sup> where also<sup>6</sup> the distinctions of dark, swift-growing
({%āśu%}), and large rice ({%mahā-vrīhi%}) are found. Probably the
swift-growing variety is that later known as {%ṣaṣṭika,%} ‘ripening
in sixty days.’ Vrīhi and {@Yava,@} ‘barley,’ are normally con-
joined in the texts.^7 {%Cf.%} {@Plāśuka.@}
<F>1) To take {%dhānya bīja%} in Rv. v. 53, 13,
as ‘rice seeds’ is unnecessary and very
improbable, nor is there better reason
to see in {%dhānya rasa%} in Av. ii. 26, 5. a
‘rice drink.’</F>
