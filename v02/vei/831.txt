1. {@Khila,@}¦<sup>1</sup> {@Khilya@}<sup>2</sup> appear to have the same meaning.
According to Roth,<sup>3</sup> these terms denote the waste land lying
between cultivated fields; but he admits that this sense does
not suit the passage of the Rigveda<sup>4</sup> in which it is said that
the god places the worshipper on an unbroken Khilya ({%abhinne%}
{%khilye%}), and he accordingly conjectures the reading {%akhilya-%}
{%bhinne,%} ‘land unbroken by barren strips.’ Pischel<sup>5</sup> thinks that
the meaning intended is broad lands, which were used for the
pasturing of the cattle of the community, and were not broken
up by cultivated fields. Oldenberg,<sup>6</sup> however, points out that
the sense is rather the land which lay between cultivated fields,
but which need not be deemed to have been unfertile, as
Roth thought. This agrees with the fact that in Vedic
times separate fields were already known: see {@Kṣetra.@}
