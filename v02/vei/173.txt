1. {@Aśva-ttha@}¦ (‘horse-stand’) is one of India's greatest trees,
the {%Ficus religiosa,%} later called {%pippala%}<sup>1</sup> (now Peepal). Vessels
made of the wood of the Aśvattha are mentioned in the Rigveda,<sup>2</sup>
and the tree itself is constantly referred to later.<sup>3</sup> Its hard
wood formed the upper of the two pieces of wood used for
kindling fire, the lower being of {@Śamī.@}<sup>4</sup> It planted its roots in
shoots of other trees, especially the {@Khadira,@} and destroyed
them;<sup>5</sup> hence it is called ‘the destroyer’ ({%vaibādha%}). Its berries
[Page1-044+ 37]
are referred to as sweet, and as eaten by birds.<sup>6</sup> The gods are
said to sit under it in the third heaven.<sup>7</sup> It and {@Nyagrodha@}
are styled the ‘crested ones’ ({%śikhaṇḍin%}).<sup>8</sup>
