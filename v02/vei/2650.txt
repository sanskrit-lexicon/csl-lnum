{@Rambha@}¦ seems to mean a ‘staff’ or ‘support’ in one passage
of the Rigveda (viii. 45, 20). In another place (ii. 15, 9) a man
is described as Rambhin, apparently as carrying a staff to
support himself in old age; Sāyaṇa explains this word as
‘door-keeper’ (like one of the senses of {%daṇḍin,%} ‘staff-bearer,’
in later Sanskrit).
