{@Tāta,@}¦ apparently ‘dada's boy,’ an affectionate term of address
by a father ({%cf.%} {@Tata@}) to a son, is found in the Brāhmaṇas,<sup>1</sup>
occurring in the vocative only. But in the sense of ‘father,’
through confusion with Tata, it occurs also as early as the
Aitareya Āraṇyaka.<sup>2</sup>
<F>1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 14, 4;
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 6;
Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 4, 2.</F>
<F>2) i. 3, 3, where Tata and Tāta are
given as variant forms of the address
of the child to the father. Little,
{%Grammatical Index,%} 75, takes Tāta to
mean ‘father’ primarily, but this seems
unlikely.
