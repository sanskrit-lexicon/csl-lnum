{@Cyavana,@}¦<sup>1</sup> {@Cyavāna,@}<sup>2</sup> are variant forms of the name of an
ancient Ṛṣi, or seer. The Rigveda<sup>3</sup> represents him as an old
decrepit man, to whom the Aśvins restored youth and strength,
making him acceptable to his wife, and a husband of maidens.
[Page1-265+ 49]
The legend is given in another form in the Śatapatha Brāh-
maṇa,<sup>4</sup> where Cyavana is described as wedding Sukanyā,
the daughter of {@Śaryāta.@} He is there called a Bhṛgu or
Āṅgirasa, and is represented as having been rejuvenated by
immersion in a pond — the first occurrence of a motive, later
very common in Oriental literature. Another legend about
Cyavāna is apparently alluded to in an obscure hymn of the
Rigveda,<sup>5</sup> where he seems to be opposed to the {@Paktha@} prince
{@Tūrvayāṇa,@} an Indra worshipper, while Cyavāna seems to
have been specially connected with the Aśvins. This explana-
tion of the hymn, suggested by Pischel,<sup>6</sup> is corroborated by the
Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>7</sup> which relates that {@Vidanvant,@} another
son of Bhṛgu, supported Cyavana against Indra, who was
angry with him for sacrificing to the Aśvins; it is also note-
worthy that the Aśvins appear in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>8</sup> as
obtaining a share in the sacrifice on the suggestion of Sukanyā.
But a reconciliation of Indra and Cyavana must have taken
place, because the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>9</sup> relates the inauguration
of {@Śāryāta@} by Cyavana with the great Indra consecration
({%aindreṇa mahābhiṣekeṇa%}). In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇā<sup>10</sup>
Cyavana is mentioned as a seer of Sāmans or Chants.
