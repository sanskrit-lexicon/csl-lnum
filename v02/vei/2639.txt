{@Rathavīti Dārbhya@}¦ (‘descendant of Darbha’) is mentioned
once in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as residing in places abounding in kine
({%gomatīr anu%}) far away among the hills, possibly the Himālayas,
and as the patron of the singer of the hymn. Later the tradition<sup>2</sup>
makes him the king, whose daughter {@Śyāsvāśva@} won for his
wife by his father's and the Maruts' aid.
