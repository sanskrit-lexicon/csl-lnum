{@Manā@}¦ is found in one passage of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> in an enumera-
tion of gifts, where it is described as ‘golden’ ({%sacā manā%}
{%hiraṇyayā%}). It therefore seems to designate some ornament, or
possibly a weight, and has accordingly been compared<sup>2</sup> with
the Greek <lang n="greek">μνᾶ</lang> (Herodotus has <lang n="greek">μνέα</lang>), the Latin {%mina.%} All three
words have been considered Semitic in origin, as borrowed from
the Phœnicians<sup>3</sup> in the case of Greece, from Carthage by way
[Page2-129+ 55]
of Etruria or Sicily in the case of Rome, and from Babylon in
the case of India. The identification as regards Manā is very
conjectural, depending merely on the probabilities of Babylonian
borrowing<sup>4</sup> seen — {%e.g.,%} in the legend of the flood, and in the
system of the {@Nakṣatras.@} On the other hand, Mahā may very
well be identical with the word {%manā%} which occurs several
times in the Rigveda<sup>5</sup> in the sense of ‘desire’ (from the root
{%man,%} ‘think’), and which may have in this one passage the
concrete sense of ‘desirable object.’ It is to be noted that in
Böhtlingk's Dictionary a single word Manā appears, to which
the only senses assigned are ‘wish,’ ‘desire,’ ‘jealousy.’

Asia Minor. The part played by the
Phœnicians in Greek life is now reduced
within narrow limits; in the case of
the {%mina,%} probably their commercial
activities may be considered as likely to
have caused the adoption of the term.</F>
