{@Nāva-prabhraṃśana,@}¦ the ‘sliding down of the ship,’ is read
in Whitney and Roth's text of the Atharvaveda,<sup>1</sup> and has been
connected by Weber<sup>2</sup> and others<sup>3</sup> with Manor Avasarpaṇa, the
name in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> of the northern mountain
on which Manu's ship settled on the subsidence of the deluge.
But both Bloomfield<sup>5</sup> and Whitney<sup>6</sup> point out that this inter-
pretation is highly improbable, and this view is accepted by
[Page1-448+ 37]
Macdonell.<sup>7</sup> The expression is analyzed as {%na ava-prabhraṃśana%}
by the Pada text and the commentator alike, and is never found
elsewhere with reference to the descent of a boat or ship.<sup>8</sup>

‘fall down,’ is never used of the
gliding down of a boat, and would be
inappropriately applied in that sense.</F>
