{@Kāri@}¦ is the name of one of the victims of the human sacrifice
(Puruṣamedha) in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,<sup>1</sup> and is there dedi-
cated to ‘laughter.’ The commentator Mahīdhara<sup>2</sup> interprets
the word as ‘worker’ ({%karaṇa-śīla%}), but the St. Petersburg
Dictionary suggests that it means a ‘jubilant’ person (as
derived from the root {%kṛ,%} ‘to praise’).
