{@Go-mṛga,@}¦ a species of ox, now called Gayal ({%Bos gavaeus%}), is
mentioned in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha, or horse
sacrifice, in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās<sup>1</sup> and Brāhmaṇas.<sup>2</sup> In the
Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>3</sup> it is declared to be neither a wild nor a
tame animal; this presumably means that it was semi-
domesticated, or perhaps that it was both tamed and found
wild. With the name of this animal may be compared the
Mṛga Mahiṣa, which is clearly mentioned as wild in the
Rigveda.<sup>4</sup> See also {@Gayava.@}
