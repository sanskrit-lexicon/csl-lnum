{@Marud-vṛdhā@}¦<sup>1</sup> is the name of a stream mentioned in the
Nadīstuti (‘Praise of Rivers’) in the Rigveda<sup>2</sup> along with the
{@Asiknī@} (Akesines) and the {@Vitastā@} (Hydaspes). Roth<sup>3</sup> con-
siders that the Marudvṛdhā denotes the stream formed by the
combined waters of these two rivers down to its junction with
the {@Paruṣṇī@} (Ravi), a view accepted by Zimmer.<sup>4</sup> On the
other hand, Ludwig<sup>5</sup> thinks that the Marudvṛdhā designates
[Page2-136+ 57]
the stream formed by the junction of the Paruṣṇī with the
combined waters of the Asiknī and Vitastā, a view which
seems less likely.

The misspelling of the name as Marud-
vṛddhā in Macdonell, {%Vedic Mythology,%}
pp. 80, 88, is corrected in the Index
and the Addenda of that work. On
