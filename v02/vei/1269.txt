{@Daśamī@}¦ denotes in the Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> and the Pañcaviṃśa
Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> the period of life between 90 and 100 years
[Page1-345+ 43]
which the Rigveda<sup>3</sup> calls the {%daśama yuga,%} ‘the tenth stage
of life.’ Longevity seems not to have been rare among the
Vedic Indians, for the desire to live a ‘hundred autumns’
({%śaradaḥ śatam%}) is constantly expressed.<sup>4</sup> {@Dīrghatamas@} is said
to have lived 100 years,<sup>5</sup> and {@Mahidāsa Aitareya@} is credited
with 116.<sup>6</sup> Onesikritos<sup>7</sup> reported that they sometimes lived
130 years, a statement with which corresponds the wish
expressed in the Jātaka<sup>8</sup> for a life of 120 years. Probably the
number was always rather imaginary than real, but the com-
parative brevity of modern life in India<sup>9</sup> may be accounted for
by the cumulative effect of fever, which is hardly known to the
Rigveda. See {@Takman.@}
