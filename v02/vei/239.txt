{@Āpayā@}¦ is the name of a river mentioned once only in the
Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> when it occurs between the {@Dṛṣadvatī@} and the
{@Sarasvatī.@} Ludwig<sup>2</sup> was inclined to identify it with the
Āpagā as a name for the Ganges, but Zimmer<sup>3</sup> correctly places
it near the Sarasvatī, either as the small tributary which flows
past Thānesar or the modern Indramatī farther west, while
Pischel<sup>4</sup> assigns it to {@Kurukṣetra,@} of which the Āpayā is
mentioned as a famous river in the Mahābhārata.<sup>5</sup>
