{@Hari-yūpīyā@}¦ is mentioned in a hymn of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as the
scene of the defeat of the {@Vṛcīvants@} by {@Abhyāvartin Cāya-@}
{@mana.@} It may denote either a place or a river, since many
battles seem to have been fought on the banks of rivers.
Ludwig<sup>2</sup> took it as the name of a town on the river {@Yavyāvatī,@}
which is identified with it in Sāyaṇa's commentary on the
passage. Hillebrandt<sup>3</sup> thinks that it is the river Iryāb (Haliāb),
a tributary of the Kurum ({@Krumu@}), but this is not at all
probable.
