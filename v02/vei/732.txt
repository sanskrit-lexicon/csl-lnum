2. {@Kośa@}¦ denotes the body of a chariot.<sup>1</sup> Presumably it was
fastened to the axles, but it was probably not very secure, as
the body of Pūṣan's chariot is said not to fall.<sup>2</sup> The ropes<sup>3</sup>
used to fasten the Kośa are perhaps referred to in the word
{%akṣā-nah.%}<sup>4</sup> By synecdoche this word also denotes the whole
chariot.<sup>5</sup> See also {@Vandhura, Ratha.@}
