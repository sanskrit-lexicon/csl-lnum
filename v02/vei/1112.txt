{@Taranta@}¦ appears, along with {@Purumīḍha,@} as a patron of
{@Śyāvāśva@} in the Rigveda.<sup>1</sup> In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup>
and other Brāhmaṇas<sup>3</sup> he, together with Purumīḍha, is de-
scribed as receiving gifts from {@Dhvasra@}<sup>4</sup> and {@Puruṣanti;@} but
since the receipt of gifts was forbidden to Kṣatriyas, they for
the nonce became Ṛṣis, and composed a passage in honour
of the donors.<sup>4</sup> He, like Purumīḍha, was a Vaidadaśvi, or
son of Vidadaśva.<sup>5</sup>
