{@Makha@}¦ appears to designate a person in two passages of the
Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> but in neither passage does the context explain who
he was. Probably a demon of some kind is meant. In the
later Saṃhitās<sup>2</sup> mention is also made of the ‘head of Makha,’
an expression which has become unintelligible to the Brāh-
maṇas.<sup>3</sup>
