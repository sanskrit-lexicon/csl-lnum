14. {@Viśākhe@}¦ is the couple of stars <lang n="greek">α</lang> and <lang n="greek">β</lang> Libræ. This

it is curious that in the Atharvaveda<sup>87</sup> the expression {%rādho%}
{%Viśākhe,%} ‘the Viśākhe are prosperity,’ should occur. But
probably Rādhā is merely an invention due to the name of the
next Nakṣatra, Anurādhā, wrongly conceived as meaning ‘that
which is after or follows Rādhā.’<sup>88</sup>
