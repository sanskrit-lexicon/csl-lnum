{@Pajra@}¦ is the name of the family from which {@Kakṣīvant@}
sprang ({@Pajriya@}). It is mentioned several times in the Rigveda.<sup>1</sup>
According to Pischel,<sup>2</sup> the epithet {%pṛkṣa-yāma%}<sup>3</sup> applied to them
means ‘carrying out brilliant sacrificial performances,’ which
won for them {@Śrutaratha's@} generosity. In two passages<sup>4</sup>
Roth<sup>5</sup> sees a Pajra called Sāmaṅ. This is uncertain, but in
any case a Pajra seems clearly alluded to. Elsewhere<sup>6</sup> it is
very doubtful whether the word is a proper name at all. In
the Śāṭyāyana<sup>7</sup> the Pajras are declared to be Aṅgirases.
