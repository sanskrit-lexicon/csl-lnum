{@Turvīti@}¦ is mentioned several times in the Rigveda, both in
association with Vayya<sup>1</sup> and alone.<sup>2</sup> In three passages<sup>3</sup>
reference is made to Indra aiding him over a flood. Ludwig<sup>4</sup>
has conjectured that he was king of the Turvaśas and Yadus.
But there is no sufficient evidence for this view, though
presumably he was of the Turvaśa tribe.
