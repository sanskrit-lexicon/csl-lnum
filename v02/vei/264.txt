{@Ārtnī@}¦ denotes the end of the bow to which the bow-string
({%jyā%}) was attached.<sup>1</sup> The string was not normally kept
fastened to both ends of the bow, but when an arrow was to
be shot it was strung taut.<sup>2</sup> On the other hand, the legend
of the death of Viṣṇu, told in the later Saṃhitās<sup>3</sup> and
Brāhmaṇas,<sup>4</sup> expressly contemplates his leaning on his strung
bow, which cleaves his head by the sudden springing apart
of the two ends when the bow-string is gnawed through.
