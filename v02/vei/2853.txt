{@Vāko-vākya,@}¦ ‘dialogue,’ is the name given in the Brāhmaṇas<sup>1</sup>
to certain portions of the Vedic texts. In one place<sup>2</sup> the
{@Brahmodya@} is said to be a dialogue; very probably in all the
passages the Brahmodya is meant by this term. Geldner's
[Page2-279+ 70]
view<sup>3</sup> is different: he sees in the Vākovākya an essential part
of the {@Itihāsa-Purāṇa,@} the dialogue or dramatic element as
opposed to the narrative portion.

not meant, though Max Müller so
renders it in his translation of the
Chāndogya Upaniṣad.</F>
