{@Madhya-deśa,@}¦ the ‘Middle Country,’ is, according to the
Mānava Dharma Śāstra,<sup>1</sup> the land between the Himālaya in
the north, the Vindhya in the south, {@Vinaśana@} in the west,
and Prayāga (now Allahabad) in the east — that is, between the
place where the {@Sarasvatī@} disappears in the desert, and the
point of the confluence of the {@Yamunā@} (Jumna) and the {@Gaṅgā@}
(Ganges). The same authority<sup>2</sup> defines Brahmarṣi-deśa as
denoting the land of {@Kurukṣetra,@} the {@Matsyas, Pañcālas,@} and
{@Śūrasenakas,@} and Brahmāvarta<sup>3</sup> as meaning the particularly
holy land between the Sarasvatī and the {@Dṛṣadvatī.@} The
Baudhāyana Dharma Sūtra<sup>4</sup> defines Āryāvarta as the land east
of Vinaśana; west of the Kālaka-vana, ‘Black Forest,’ or rather
Kanakhala, near Hardvār; south of the Himālaya; and north
of the Pāriyātra or the Pāripātra Mountains; adding that, in
the opinion of others,<sup>5</sup> it was confined to the country between
the Yamunā and the Gaṅgā, while the {@Bhāllavins@}<sup>6</sup> took it as
the country between the boundary-river (or perhaps the Saras-
[Page2-126+ 84]
vatī)<sup>7</sup> and the region where the sun rises. The Mānava
Dharma Śāstra,<sup>8</sup> in accord with the Vasiṣṭha Dharma Sūtra,<sup>9</sup>
defines Āryāvarta as the region between the Vindhya and the
Himālaya, the two ranges which seem to be the boundaries of
the Āryan world in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad also.<sup>10</sup>
<div n="P"/>The term Madhyadeśa is not Vedic, but it is represented in
the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>11</sup> by the expression {%madhyamā pratiṣṭhā%}
{%diś,%} ‘the middle fixed region,’ the inhabitants of which are
stated to be the Kurus, the Pañcālas, the {@Vaśas,@} and the
{@Uśīnaras.@} The latter two peoples practically disappear later
on, the Madhyadeśa being the country of the Kuru-Pañcālas,
the land where the Brāhmaṇas and the later Saṃhitās were
produced, bounded on the east by the {@Kosala-Videhas,@} and on
the west by the desert. The western tribes are mentioned with
disapproval both in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>12</sup> and the Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa,<sup>13</sup> while the tradition of the Brahminization of the
Kosalas and the Videhas from the Kuru-Pañcāla country is
preserved in the former Brāhmaṇa.<sup>14</sup>

between {%sindhur vidhāraṇī%} or {%vidharaṇī%}
and {%sindhur vicaraṇī%} or {%visavaṇī.%} The
latter expression must refer to the
Sarasvatī; the former may, but not
necessarily. Conceivably the Sindhu
(Indus) is meant; for it was a great
boundary, with Āryan tribes to the east
of it.</F>

14, 2, 3; 146, 147, who points out that
the Pāripātra Mountains are a part of
the Vindhya range in Mālvā, and who
suggests that the western boundary was
originally the Ādarśa Mountains; for
the reading of the manuscripts, and
of the scholiast Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita, in the
Vasiṣṭha Dharma Sūtra, i. 8, is {%prāg%}
{%ādarśanāt,%} not {%adarśanāt%} (corresponding
with the Vinaśana of Baudhāyana
Dharma Sūtra, i. 2, 9), and the Mahā-

Keith, {%ibid.,%} 1908, 1143; Max Müller,
{%Sacred Books of the East,%} 32, 58, 59;
{%Indian Empire,%} 1, 303, 304, where the
extraordinary theory is adopted that
the Madhyadeśa was peopled by a new
race of immigrant Āryans, who, travel-
ling viâ Chitral and Gilgit, and bringing
no women with them, married Dravidian
women, and produced the so-called
Āryo-Dravidians. It is quite impossible
to find any support for this theory in
Vedic literature. To say, as is there
said, that the ‘Vedic hymns contain
no reference to the route by which the
Āryans entered India or to their earlier
settlements on the Indus,’ and that this
is explained by the theory of the entry
of the Vedic Indians viâ Chitral, is to
assert absurdities. The theory is based
on the later dialects and their affinities
(see Grierson, {%Indian Empire,%} 1, 357
{%et seq.%}); it can probably not be regarded
as at all valid for any period — at any
rate, it is not cogent for the eighth
century, B.C.</F>
