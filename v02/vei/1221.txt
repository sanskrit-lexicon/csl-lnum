{@Tri-śaṅku@}¦ is in Vedic literature the name of a sage men-
tioned as a teacher in the Taittirīya Upaniṣad.<sup>1</sup> There is no
trace of the later legend by which he becomes the victim of
{@Vasiṣṭha's@} curse and the object of {@Viśvāmitra's@} solicitude,
being eventually fixed in the sky as a constellation.<sup>2</sup> The
confusion of the chronology in the tales of Triśaṅku is a good
example of the worthlessness of the supposed epic tradition.
