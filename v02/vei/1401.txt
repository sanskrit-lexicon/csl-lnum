{@Dru-ghaṇa@}¦ is found in the Mudgala hymn of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup>
and in the Atharvaveda.<sup>2</sup> The sense is uncertain. Yāska<sup>3</sup>
renders it as a ‘{%ghana%} made of wood,’ probably, as Roth<sup>4</sup> takes
it, meaning a ‘club of wood.’ Geldner<sup>5</sup> thinks that it was a
wooden bull used by Mudgala as a substitute for a second bull
when he wanted to join in a race. But this interpretation of
the legend is very improbable.<sup>6</sup> Whitney<sup>7</sup> translates the word
as ‘tree-smiter’ in the Atharvaveda, quoting Sāyaṇa, who
explains it as a ‘cutting instrument,’ so called because trees are
struck with it.
