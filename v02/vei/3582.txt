Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 11, 9; Tait-
tirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 4. This is the
view of Roth, St. Petersburg Dic-
tionary, {%s.v.,%} and of Zimmer, {%Altindisches%}
{%Leben,%} 53. But Griffith, Translation of
the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 183, n., thinks
that in xix. 80 lead is referred to not
as a weight, but as a charm against
demons and sorcery.
