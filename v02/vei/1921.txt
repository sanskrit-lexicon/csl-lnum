{@Pṛthivī@}¦ denotes the ‘earth’ as the ‘broad’ one in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup>
and later,<sup>2</sup> being often personified as a deity<sup>3</sup> both alone and
with {@Div,@} ‘heaven,’ as Dyāvā-Pṛthivī.<sup>4</sup> Mention is often made
of three earths,<sup>5</sup> of which the world on which we live is the
highest.<sup>6</sup> The earth is girdled by the ocean, according to the
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>7</sup> The Nirukta<sup>8</sup> places one of the three
earths in each of the worlds into which the universe is divided
[Page2-017+ 44]
(see {@Div@}). In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>9</sup> the earth is called
the ‘firstborn of being,’ and its riches ({%vitta%}) are referred to;<sup>10</sup>
hence in a late passage of the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka<sup>11</sup> the
earth is styled {%vasu-matī,%} ‘full of wealth.’ The word also occurs
in the Rigveda,<sup>12</sup> though rarely, in the form of Pṛthvī.<sup>13</sup>
