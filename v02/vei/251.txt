{@Ā-yudha,@}¦ ‘weapon,’ in its widest sense covers the whole
of a Kṣatriya's warlike equipment, which in the Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> is summed up as horse-chariot ({%aśva-ratha%}), bow
and arrows ({%iṣu-dhanva%}), and corselet ({%kavaca%}). As the bow and
arrow ({%iṣu, dhanvan%}) were essential as the main weapons of
the Vedic fighter, they are probably meant when Āyudha is
used specifically of weapons, as often from the Rigveda<sup>2</sup>
onwards. The battle hymn in the Rigveda<sup>3</sup> confirms this
view, as it presents to us the warrior armed with bow and
arrow on his chariot, and clad in armour ({@Varman@}), with a
guard ({@Hastaghna@}) on the left arm to avoid the friction of the
bow-string. The corselet was not a single solid piece of metal,
but consisted of many pieces fitted together ({%syūta%});<sup>4</sup> it may
[Page1-061+ 41]
have been made either of metal plates or, as is more likely, of
some stiff material plated with metal. In addition the warrior
wore a helmet ({@Śiprā@}). There is no trace of the use of a
shield, nor is there any clear record of the employment of
greaves or other guard for the feet.<sup>5</sup> Skill in the use of weapons
is referred to in the Rigveda.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is doubtful whether sling stones ({@Adri, Aśani@}) were in
ordinary use. The hook ({%aṅkuśa%})<sup>7</sup> also is merely a divine
weapon, and the axe ({%svadhiti,%}<sup>8</sup> {%vāśī, paraśu%}) does not occur in
mortal combats. For the use of the spear see {@Ṛṣṭi, Rambhiṇī,@}
{@Śakti, Śaru;@} of the sword, {@Asi, Kṛti.@} Neither weapon can be
considered ordinary in warfare, nor was the club ({@Vajra@}) used.
For the modes of warfare see {@Saṃgrāma.@}
