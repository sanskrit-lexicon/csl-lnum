1. {@Bheṣaja,@}¦ denoting a ‘remedial agent,’ ‘medicine,’ is often
mentioned in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later,<sup>2</sup> being also used in a
figurative sense.<sup>3</sup> Plants,<sup>4</sup> waters,<sup>5</sup> and spells<sup>6</sup> are repeatedly
enumerated as medicines. Most of the medical practices of the
Atharvaveda are merely examples of sympathetic magic. For
example, in one hymn<sup>7</sup> the yellow of jaundice is entreated to
pass into yellow birds. In another<sup>8</sup> fever is to be banished by
means of a frog; for the frog, being a potent means of cooling
fire<sup>9</sup> (because of its association with water), is regarded as
analogously effective in banishing the fire of fever. See {@Bhiṣaj.@}
