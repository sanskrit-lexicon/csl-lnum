{@Vyacha@}¦ in {%go-vyacha,%} the name of one of the victims at the
Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda,<sup>1</sup> is of
uncertain signification. According to Sāyaṇa,<sup>2</sup> the compound
denotes a ‘driver out of cows.’ Perhaps it means a ‘tormentor
of cows,’ as the St. Petersburg Dictionary takes it. Weber<sup>3</sup>
renders it as ‘knacker of cows,’ Eggeling as ‘one who
approaches cows.’
