{@Edidhiṣuḥ-pati@}¦ is a term occurring only in the Vājasaneyi
Saṃhitā,<sup>1</sup> where the commentator Mahīdhara interprets it as
[Page1-121+ 34]
meaning the ‘husband of a younger sister married before the
elder sister.’ Though this sense is probably correct, the form
is doubtless, as Delbrück<sup>2</sup> points out, corrupt. See {@Didhiṣūpati.@}
