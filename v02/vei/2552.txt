{@Yajus@}¦ is repeatedly distinguished from the Ṛc and the {@Sāman@}
in Vedic literature.<sup>1</sup> The Yajus is the utterance accompanying
the sacrifice, and may have the form of verse or prose, the tern

Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 3, 1; 9, 4;
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, i. 30; iv. 1;

Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 4, 33,
there is a reference to the {%śuklāni%}
{%Yajūṃṣi,%} ‘white or pure Yajus,’ as
promulgated by {@Vājasaneya Yājña-@}
{@valkya,@} whence the Vājasaneyi Saṃ-
hītā is popularly known as the ‘White
Yajurveda.’ The theory that this is
due to the fact that in the Vājasaneyi
the Mantra parts of the text are not
accompanied by Brāhmaṇa passages
is, though accepted by Weber, {%Indian%}

{%Books of the East,%} 12, xxvii, and others,
now to be abandoned. In the Taittirīya
Āraṇyaka, v. 10, the expression {%śukra-%}
{%yajāṃṣi%} seems to refer to books iv. and
v. of that text. {%Cf.%} also Winternitz.
