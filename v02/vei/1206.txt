{@Trasa-dasyu,@}¦ son of {@Purukutsa,@}<sup>1</sup> is mentioned in the Rigveda
as king of the Pūrus.<sup>2</sup> He was born to Purukutsa by his wife,
{@Purukutsānī,@} at a time of great distress;<sup>3</sup> this, according to
Sāyaṇa, refers to Purukutsa's captivity: possibly his death is
really meant. Trasadasyu was also a descendant of Girikṣit,<sup>4</sup>
and Purukutsa was a descendant of Durgaha. The genealogy,
therefore, appears to be: Durgaha, Girikṣit, Purukutsa, Trasa-
dasyu. Trasadasyu was the ancestor of {@Tṛkṣi,@}<sup>5</sup> and, according
to Ludwig,<sup>6</sup> had a son Hiraṇin. Trasadasyu's chronological
position is determined by the fact that his father, Purukutsa,
was a contemporary of Sudās, either as an opponent<sup>7</sup> or as
a friend.<sup>8</sup> That Purukutsa was an enemy of Sudās is more
probable, because the latter's predecessor, Divodāsa, was
apparently<sup>9</sup> at enmity with the Pūrus, and in the battle of the
ten kings Pūrus were ranged against Sudās and the Tṛtsus.
Trasadasyu himself seems to have been an energetic king.
His people, the Pūrus, were settled on the {@Sarasvatī,@}<sup>10</sup> which
was, no doubt, the stream in the middle country, that locality
according well with the later union of the Pūrus with the
{@Kuru@} people, who inhabited that country. This union is
exemplified in the person of {@Kuruśravaṇa,@} who is called
Trāsadasyava, ‘descendant of Trasadasyu,’ in the Rigveda,<sup>11</sup>
whose father was {@Mitrātithi,@} and whose son was {@Upamaśravas.@}
The relation of Mitrātithi to Tṛkṣi does not appear.
<div n="P"/>Another descendant of Trasadasyu was {@Tryaruṇa Traivṛṣṇa,@}
who is simply called Trasadasyu in a hymn of the Rigveda.<sup>12</sup>
[Page1-328+ 50]
He was not only a ‘descendant of Trivṛṣan,’ but, according
to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>13</sup> he was also Traidhātva,
‘descendant of Tridhātu.’ The order of these two predecessors
of Tryaruṇa cannot be determined in any way from Vedic
literature. According to the later tradition,<sup>14</sup> a prince named
Tridhanvan preceded Tryaruṇa in the succession. Vedic tradi-
tion further fails to show in what precise relation Trasadasyu
stood to Trivṛṣan or Tryaruṇa.
<div n="P"/>Trasdasyu Paurukutsa appears in several Brāhmaṇas<sup>15</sup> as a
famous sacrificer of ancient times, together with {@Para Āṭṇāra,@}
{@Vītahavya Śrāyasa,@} and {@Kakṣīvant Auśija,@} who in the
Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa<sup>16</sup> are called ‘ancient great
kings’ ({%pūrve mahārājāḥ%}).

disappeared from the Epic tradition;
