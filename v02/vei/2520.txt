{@Mṛtyu,@}¦ ‘death,’ is repeatedly mentioned in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup>
and later<sup>2</sup> as a thing of terror. There are a hundred and one
forms of death, the natural one by old age<sup>3</sup> ({%jarā%}), and a
hundred others, all to be avoided.<sup>4</sup> To die before old age
({%purā jarasaḥ%})<sup>5</sup> is to die before the allotted span ({%purā āyuṣaḥ%}),<sup>6</sup>
the normal length of life being throughout Vedic literature
spoken of as a hundred years.<sup>7</sup> On the other hand, the evils
of old age in the loss of physical strength were clearly realized.<sup>8</sup>
one of the feats of the Aśvins was to restore old {@Cyavāna@} to
his former youth and powers, and another was the rejuvenation
of {@Kali.@}<sup>9</sup> The Atharvaveda<sup>10</sup> is full of charms of all sorts to
avert death and secure length of years ({%āyuṣya%}).
<div n="P"/>The modes of disposing of the dead were burial and cremation
(see {@Agnidagdha@}). Both existed in the early Vedic period,<sup>11</sup>
as in Greece;<sup>12</sup> but the former method was on the whole less
favoured, and tended to be regarded with disapproval. The
bones of the dead, whether burned or not, were marked by the
erection of a tumulus ({@Śmaśāna@}): the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>13</sup>
preserves traces of strong differences of opinion as to the mode
in which these tumuli should be constructed. There is little
or no trace<sup>14</sup> of the custom common in northern lands of
sending the dead man to sea in a burning ship: the reference
[Page2-176+ 60]
to a ship<sup>15</sup> seems to point to mythical perils after death, not to
the mode of burial.
<div n="P"/>The life after death was to the Vedic Indian a repetition of
the life in this world. He passed into the next world {%sarva-%}
{%tanuḥ sāṅgaḥ,%} ‘with whole body and all his members,’<sup>16</sup> enjoying
there the same pleasures as he had enjoyed on earth. Even
in the Rigveda<sup>17</sup> there are hints of evil awaiting evil-doers, but
it is not until the Atharvaveda<sup>18</sup> and the Brāhmaṇas<sup>19</sup> that
a hell of punishment is set out, and it is in the Brāhmaṇas<sup>20</sup>
that good and evil deeds are said to produce happiness or hell
hereafter. But there is no hint of extinction<sup>21</sup> in the Rigveda
as the fate of the wicked, as Roth<sup>22</sup> inclined to think. The
Vedic poet not being deeply moral, his verses do not convey,
as would those of a man convinced of sin, warnings of future
judgment.
