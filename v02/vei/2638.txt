{@Ratha-vāhana@}¦ is the name in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later<sup>2</sup> for a
movable stand to hold the chariot. According to Roth,<sup>3</sup> it
corresponds to the Greek <lang n="greek">βωμός</lang>, on which the chariot rested
when out of use. The word Rathavāhana-vāha is employed in
the sense of the two horses that draw the stand.<sup>4</sup> Weber<sup>5</sup> thinks
it was used to convey the war chariot to the scene of action.

Weber, however, admits that the Ratha-
vāhana may at times have served as a
mere stand, like the Homeric <lang n="greek">βωμός</lang>
while Geldner expresses the opinion
that it never has that sense. The use
of the term Rathavāhanavāha shows
that the stand was movable.</F>
