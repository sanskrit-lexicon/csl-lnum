{@Āji@}¦ is constantly used in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and the later
literature to express the sense of ‘a race,’ and only seldom
denotes ‘a battle.’ {@Horse@}-racing was one of the favourite
amusements of the {@Vedic@} Indian,<sup>2</sup> the other being dicing
[Page1-054+ 65]
({@Akṣa@}). The racecourse, called Kāṣṭhā<sup>3</sup> or Āji<sup>4</sup> itself, appears
from the Atharvaveda<sup>5</sup> to have been a quasi-circular one to
a mark ({%kārṣman%}<sup>6</sup> ) and back again. In the Rigveda the
course is described as broad ({%urvī%}) and the distance as
measured out ({%apāvṛktā aratnayaḥ%}).<sup>7</sup> Prizes ({%dhana%}) were
offered ({%dhā%}),<sup>8</sup> and eagerly competed for. Other words for
victory and the prize are {%kāra%}<sup>9</sup> and {%bhara;%}<sup>10</sup> and to ‘run a
race’ is described by the expressions {%ājim aj, i, dhāv, sṛ.%}<sup>11</sup>
The person who instituted a race is referred to as {%āji-sṛt,%}<sup>12</sup> and
Indra is called {%āji-kṛt%}<sup>13</sup> (‘race-maker’), and {%āji-pati%}<sup>14</sup> (‘lord
of the race’).
<div n="P"/>The swift steeds ({%vājin, atya%}) used for the races were often
washed and adorned.<sup>15</sup> According to Pischel<sup>16</sup> the name of
one swift mare is preserved — viz., Viśpalā,<sup>17</sup> whose broken leg
was replaced by the Aśvins in a race; but the interpretation
is very doubtful. Geldner<sup>18</sup> has also found a comic picture of
a horse-chariot race in the Mudgala hymn in the Rigveda,
but Bloomfield<sup>19</sup> has shown that that interpretation is un-
sound. Pischel<sup>20</sup> also seeks to show that races were run in
honour of gods, but the evidence for the theory is inadequate.<sup>21</sup>
[Page1-055+ 46]
A formal race, however, is a feature of the ritual of the Rājasūya
or royal consecration.<sup>22</sup>

80, 8. Zimmer suggests that it may
mean ‘the course is straight,’ without
twistings, for which idea {%cf.%} Geldner,
{%Vedische Studien,%} 2, 160, quoting the
comparison of the courser's race with
a bowstring (Rv. iii. 53, 24). It is also
rendered ‘the barriers are removed.’</F>

a race in honour of Vivasvant, but his
equation of Khela and Vivasvant is
denied even by Sieg, who accepts his
