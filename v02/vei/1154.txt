{@Tirindira@}¦ is mentioned in a Dānastuti, or ‘Praise of Gifts,’
in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as having, along with {@Parśu,@} bestowed gifts
on the singer. In the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>2</sup> this state-
ment is represented by a tale that the Kaṇva Vatsa obtained
a gift from Tirindira Pāraśavya, Tirindira and Parśu being
in this version thus treated as one and the same man.
Ludwig<sup>3</sup> sees in the Rigvedic passage a proof that the Yadus
had gained a victory over Tirindira, and gave a part of the
booty to the singers; but there is no proof whatever of the
correctness of this interpretation, which Zimmer<sup>4</sup> shows to be
most unlikely. Yadu princes must be meant by Tirindira and
[Page1-311+ 57]
Parśu, though Weber<sup>5</sup> thinks that the singers were Yadus, not
the princes. The latter he holds to have been Iranian ({%cf.%}
<lang n="greek">Τιρίβαζος</lang>, and see {@Parśu@}), and he thinks that in this there is
evidence of continual close relations between India and Iran.
This is perfectly possible, but the evidence for it is rather
slight.

Hopkins, {%Journal of the American Oriental%}
