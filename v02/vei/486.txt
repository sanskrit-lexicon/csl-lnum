{@Aurṇa-vābha,@}¦ ‘descendant of Ūrṇavābhi.’ (1) This is the
name of a pupil of {@Kauṇḍinya@} mentioned in a Vaṃśa (list of
teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad.<sup>1</sup> (2) A teacher
of this name is frequently referred to in the Nirukta. His
explanations in two passages<sup>2</sup> agree with those of the Nairuktas
[Page1-129+ 41]
or etymological school of interpreters of the Rigveda. In other
passages<sup>3</sup> he appears rather to belong to the school of the
Aitihāsikas, who relied on traditional legends. He was thus
probably, as Sieg<sup>4</sup> suggests, an eclectic.
