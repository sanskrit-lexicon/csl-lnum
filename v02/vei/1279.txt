{@Dasyu,@}¦ a word of somewhat doubtful origin, is in many
passages of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> clearly applied to superhuman
enemies. On the other hand, there are several passages in
which human foes, probably the aborigines, are thus designated.
This may be regarded as certain in those passages where the
Dasyu is opposed to the Āryan, who defeats him with the aid
of the gods.<sup>2</sup> The great difference between the Dasyus and
the Āryans was their religion: the former are styled ‘not
sacrificing,’ ‘devoid of rites,’ ‘addicted to strange vows,’ ‘god-
hating,’ and so forth.<sup>3</sup> As compared with the {@Dāsa,@} they are
less distinctively a people: no clans ({%viśaḥ%}) of the Dasyus are
mentioned, and while Indra's {%dasyu-hatya,%} ‘slaughter of the
Dasyus,’ is often spoken of, there is no corresponding use of
{%dāsa-hatya.%} That the Dasyus were real people is, however,
shown by the epithet {%anās%} applied to them in one passage of the
Rigveda.<sup>5</sup> The sense of this word is not absolutely certain: the
Pada text and Sāyaṇa both take it to mean ‘without face’ ({%an-ās%}),<sup>6</sup>
but the other rendering, ‘noseles’ ({%a-nās%}), is quite possible,<sup>7</sup>

and would accord well with the flat-nosed aborigines of the
Dravidian<sup>8</sup> type, whose language still persists among the Brahuis,
who are found in the north-west. This interpretation would
receive some support from Vṛtra's being called ‘broken-nosed’
if this were a correct explanation of the obscure word {%rujānās.%}<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>The other epithet of the Dasyus is {%mṛdhra-vāc,%} which
occurs with {%anās,%}<sup>10</sup> and which has been rendered<sup>11</sup> ‘of stam-
mering, or unintelligible speech.’ This version is by no
means certain, and since the epithet is elsewhere<sup>12</sup> applied
to Āryans, its correct meaning is more probably ‘of hostile
speech.’
<div n="P"/>Dasyu corresponds with the Iranian {%daṅhu, daqyu,%} which
denotes a ‘province.’ Zimmer<sup>13</sup> thinks that the original
meaning was ‘enemy,’ whence the Iranians developed the
sense of ‘hostile country,’ ‘conquered country,’ ‘province,’
while the Indians, retaining the signification of ‘enemy,’ ex-
tended it to include demon foes. Roth<sup>14</sup> considers that the
meaning of human enemy is a transfer from the strife of gods
[Page1-349+ 59]
and demons. Lassen<sup>15</sup> attempted to connect the contrast
{%daqyu: dasyu%} with that of {%daeva: deva,%} and to see in it a result
of the religious differences which, according to Haug's theory,
had separated the Iranians and the Indians. The word may
have originally meant ‘ravaged land’<sup>16</sup> as a result of invasion;
hence ‘enemies’ country,' then ‘hostile people,’ who as human
foes were more usually called by the cognate name of {@Dāsa.@}
<div n="P"/>Individual Dasyus are {@Cumuri, Śambara, Śuṣṇa,@} etc.
<div n="P"/>In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>17</sup> the word has, as later,<sup>18</sup> the
sense of uncivilized peoples generally.

vii. 5, 6; x. 49, 3. Probably also in
v. 70, 3; x. 83, 6, people are meant.</F>
<F>3) The Dasyu is called {%a-karman,%} ‘rite-

the gods,’ viii. 70, 11; {%a-brahman,%}

<F>6) This sense allows of two inter-
pretations: ‘misfeatured,’ which seems
that of Roth, St. Petersburg Dic-
tionary, {%s.v.,%} and Grassmann, {%Wörter-%}
{%buch;%} or ‘speechless’ (that is, unable
to speak the language of the Āryans),
which is that of Bollensen, {%Zeitschrift%}
{%der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesell-%}
{%schaft,%} 41, 496.</F>
<F>7) This view is supported by Mega-
sthenes' report as to natives who were

<F>8) The suggestion in the {%Indian Empire,%}
1, 390, that the modern Brahui type is
the true Dravidian, while the modern
Dravidian is the result of fusion with
Muṇḍā-speaking tribes, would render
this theory improbable. But it seems
more probable that the Brahuis in
speech preserve the tradition of Dra-
vidian settlements in North India.</F>

berg, {%Ṛgveda-Noten,%} 1, 31, 32 (who
suggests as possible the analysis of the
word as {%rujā-anāḥ%}). But {%cf.%} Lanman,
{%Sanskrit Reader,%} 361, who suggests the
emendation {%rujānaḥ%} as nominative
singular of the simple participle

<F>12) The expression is used of the
Āryan Pūrus in vii. 18, 13; of the Paṇis
in vii. 6, 3; and of hostile persons in
i. 174, 2; v. 32, 8; x. 23, 5. Roth,
{%Erläuterungen zum Nirukta,%} 97, thinks
the sense is ‘of insulting speech,’ and
Zimmer, {%op. cit.,%} 114, 115, strongly
supports this view. But Hillebrandt,
{%op. cit.,%} 1, 89, 90, 114, prefers to see in
it ‘speaking an enemy's speech,’ and
thinks that the Pūrus were dialectically
different from the Bharatas — a view
which can be supported from the Śata-
patha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 1, 23, 24,
where the Asuras say {%he'lavo%} (= {%he'rayo,%}
‘ho, enemies,’ in Sanskrit). See Muir,
{%op. cit.,%} 2^2, 114; Davidson, {%Zeitschrift%}
{%der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesell-%}
{%schaft,%} 37, 23 (the Mahābhāṣya version);
Eggeling, {%Sacred Books of the East,%} 26,
31, n. 3. The word could thus apply
to the Dasyus also, as the strange
speech of the enemy could be either
Āryan or aboriginal.</F>

to be derived from the root {%das,%} which,
according to Whitney, {%Roots,%} means
‘lay waste’; but, according to Roth,
‘suffer want,’ ‘waste away.’</F>
