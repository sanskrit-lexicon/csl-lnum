{@Bharata@}¦ is the name of a people of great importance in the
Rigveda and the later literature. In the Rigveda they appear
prominently in the third and seventh Maṇḍalas in connexion
[Page2-095+ 65]
with {@Sudās@} and the {@Tṛtsus,@}<sup>1</sup> while in the sixth Maṇḍala they
are associated with {@Divodāsa.@}<sup>2</sup> In one passage<sup>3</sup> the Bharatas
are, like the Tṛtsus, enemies of the {@Pūrus:@} there can be little
doubt that Ludwig's view of the identity of the Bharatas and
and Tṛtsus is practically correct. More precisely Oldenberg<sup>5</sup>
considers that the Tṛtsus are the {@Vasiṣṭhas,@} the family singers
of the Bharatas; while Geldner<sup>6</sup> recognizes, with perhaps more
probability, in the Tṛtsus the royal family of the Bharatas.
That the Tṛtsus and Bharatas were enemies, as Zimmer<sup>7</sup>
holds, is most improbable even on geographical grounds, for the
Tṛtsus in Zimmer's view<sup>8</sup> occupied the country to the east of
the {@Paruṣṇī@} (Ravi), and the Bharatas must therefore be
regarded as coming against the Tṛtsus from the west, whereas
the Rigveda<sup>9</sup> recognizes two Bharata chiefs on the {@Sarasvatī,@}
{@Āpayā,@} and {@Dṛṣadvatī@} — that is, in the holy land of India, the
{@Madhyadeśa.@} Hillebrandt<sup>10</sup> sees in the connexion of the
Tṛtsus and the Bharatas a fusion of two tribes; but this is not
supported by any evidence beyond the fact that in his opinion
some such theory is needed to explain Divodāsa's appearing in
connexion with the {@Bharadvāja@} family, while Sudās, his son,
<div n="P"/>^4 Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 172
{%et seq.%}
[Page2-096+ 65]
or perhaps grandson ({%cf.%} {@Pijavana@}), is connected with the
Vasiṣṭhas and the {@Viśvāmitras.@}
<div n="P"/>In the later literature the Bharatas appear as especially
famous. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>11</sup> mentions Bharata Dauḥ-
ṣanti as a king, sacrificer of the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’)
and {@Śatānīka Sātrājita,@} as another Bharata who offered that
sacrifice. The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>12</sup> mentions Bharata Dauḥ-
ṣanti as receiving the kingly coronation from {@Dīrghatamas@}
{@Māmateya,@} and Śatānīka as being consecrated by {@Somaśuṣman@}
{@Vājaratnāyana,@} a priest whose name is of quite late origin.
The geographical position of the Bharata people is clearly
shown by the fact that the Bharata kings win victories over the
{@Kāśis,@} and make offerings on the {@Yamunā@} (Jumna) and {@Gaṅgā@}
(Ganges).<sup>13</sup> Moreover, in the formula of the king's proclama-
tion for the people, the variants recorded<sup>14</sup> include {%Kuravaḥ,%}
{%Pañcālāḥ, Kuru-Pañcālāḥ,%} and {%Bharatāḥ;%} and the Mahābhārata
consistently recognizes the royal family of the {@Kurus@} as a
Bharata family.<sup>15</sup> It is therefore extremely probable that
Oldenberg<sup>16</sup> is right in holding that the Bharatas in the times
of the Brāhmaṇas were merging in the Kuru-Pañcāla people.
<div n="P"/>The ritual practices of the Bharatas are repeatedly mentioned
in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>17</sup> the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>18</sup> the
[Page2-097+ 67]
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>19</sup> and the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka.<sup>20</sup> Already
in the Rigveda<sup>21</sup> there is mention made of Agni Bhārata (‘of
the Bharatas’). In the Āprī hymns<sup>22</sup> occurs a goddess
Bhāratī, the personified divine protective power of the
Bharatas: her association in the hymns with Sarasvatī reflects
the connexion of the Bharatas with the Sarasvatī in the
Rigveda.<sup>9</sup> Again, in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>23</sup> Agni is
referred to as {%brāhmaṇa Bhārata,%} ‘priest of the Bharatas,’ and
is invited to dispose of the offering {%Manuṣvat Bharatavat,%} ‘like
Manu,’ ‘like Bharata.’<sup>24</sup>
<div n="P"/>In one or two passages<sup>25</sup> Sudās or Divodāsa and, on the
other hand, Purukutsa or Trasadasyu appear in a friendly
relation. Possibly this points, as Oldenberg<sup>26</sup> suggests, to the
union of Bharatas and Pūrus with the Kurus.
<div n="P"/>A Bharata is referred to in the fifth Maṇḍala of the Rig-
veda:<sup>27</sup> who he was is uncertain.
<F>1) iii. 53, 9. 12, 24; 33, 11, 12 (Viśvā
mitra, who is accordingly hailed as
{%Bharata-ṛṣabha,%} ‘bull of the Bharatas,’
in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 17, 7);
vii. 8, 4; 33, 6, in which passage a
defeat of the Bharatas, and their rescue
by the aid of Vasiṣṭha, is clearly referred
to; not, as was formerly thought ({%e.g.,%}
Muir, {%Sanskrit Texts,%} 12, 354; Zimmer,
{%Altindisches Leben,%} 127), a defeat of the
Bharatas by the Tṛtsus.</F>

<F>3) vii. 8, 4.</F>

identification of Ludwig.</F>
<F>6) {%Vedische Studien,%} 2, 136 {%et seq.%}</F>
<F>7) {%Altindisches Leben,%} 127. This is also
Bloomfield's view (see {%Journal of the%}
{%American Oriental Society,%} 16, 41, 42).</F>
<F>8) {%Op. cit.,%} 124.</F>
<F>9) iii. 23, 4: in verse 2 {@Devasravas@}
and {@Devavāta@} are mentioned as
Bhāratas, Oldenberg, {%Buddha,%} 410, n.,
mentions that in the Mahābhārata,
iii. 6065, a tributary of the Sarasvatī
is called Kauśikī, and the Kuśikas are,
of course, the family of Viśvāmitra,
whose connexion with the Bharatas is
beyond question.</F>
<F>10) {%Vedische Mythologie,%} 1, 111. His
view is that Sudās and the Bharatas
were later comers than the Tṛtsus, who
joined them as one people, the Vasiṣṭhas
becoming the priests of the Bharatas.
He suggests that the Vasiṣṭhas were
not originally adherents of the Indra-
Soma cult, but were specially devoted
to the Varuṇa cult; but there is
no decisive evidence for either sug-
gestion. {%Cf.%} Bloomfield, as cited in
n. 7.</F>
<F>11) xiii. 5, 4.</F>
<F>12) viii. 23 and 21.</F>
<F>13) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 4,
11. 21.</F>
<F>14) In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8,
10, 2, and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa,
i. 7, 4, 2, the phrase is {%eṣa vo, Bharatā,%}
{%rājā;%} the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, in the
Kāṇva recension, xi. 3, 3; 6, 3, has {%Kura-%}
{%vaḥ, Pañcālāḥ%} (evidently as a joint people);
Āpastamba, xviii. 12, 7, gives {%Bharatāḥ,%}
{%Kuravaḥ, Pañcālāḥ, Kuru-Pañcālāḥ,%} and
{%janatāḥ,%} as alternatives, according to
the people to whom the king belongs;
the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xv. 7, and the
Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 6, 7, read {%esa te%}
{%janate rājā.%} See Weber, {%Indian Litera-%}

{%Literatur und Cultur,%} 465.</F>
<F>15) Oldenberg, {%Buddha,%} 409.</F>
<F>16) {%Op. cit.,%} 408. He points out
(409, n.) that in the Satapatha Brāh-
maṇa, xiii. 5, 4, only the Kuru king.
{@Janamejaya,@} and the Bharata kings
are mentioned without specification of
the peoples over whom they ruled.</F>
<F>17) xiv. 3, 13; xv. 5, 24, and perhaps
xviii. 10, 8, on which see Weber,
{%Indische Studien,%} 10, 28, n. 2; below, p. 98.</F>
<F>18) ii. 25; iii. 18. The sense ‘mer-
cenary soldier,’ here seen by the St.
Petersburg Dictionary, {%s.v.%} 2 (no longer
mentioned in the Dictionary of Böht-
lingk), cannot be accepted. See Weber,
{%Indische Studien,%} 9, 254; Oldenberg,
{%Buddha,%} 407, n. On the other hand,
there is no mention of the Bharatas in
the geographical lists of the Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa (viii. 14). in the Mānava
Dharma Śāstra, or in the Buddhist
texts. This means that the Bharatas
were no longer a people, but a family
or sub-tribe in a larger people.</F>
<F>19) v. 4, 4, 1.</F>
<F>20) i. 27, 2.</F>
<F>21) ii. 7, 1. 5; iv. 25, 4; vi. 16, 19;
Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 9, 1; Śata-
patha Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 2, 2. Roth thinks
this epithet of Agni perhaps means
‘warlike,’ but this is unlikely.</F>
