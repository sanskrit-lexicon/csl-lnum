{@Sā-varṇi@}¦ is found as a patronymic in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> together
with Sāvarṇya.<sup>2</sup> It is clear that no man called Savarṇa ever
existed, though Roth<sup>3</sup> accepted that view, and that the refer-
ence is to the mythical {@Manu@} Sāvarṇi, the descendant of the
{%sa-varṇā%} female, who, according to the legend,<sup>4</sup> took the place
of Saraṇyū.
