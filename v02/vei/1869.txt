{@Puru-ṇītha Śāta-vaneya@}¦ (‘descendant of Śatavani’) is the
name of a sacrificer, or perhaps a priest, a Bhāradvāja, in the
Rigveda.<sup>1</sup> It is doubtful whether he is also mentioned as a
singer in another passage of the Rigveda.<sup>2</sup> In both places
Roth<sup>3</sup> sees in Puru-ṇītha merely a word meaning ‘choral song.’
