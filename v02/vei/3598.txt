{@Su-dās@}¦ is the name of the {@Tṛtsu@} king who won a famous
victory over the ten kings, as described in a hymn of the
Rigveda.<sup>1</sup> At one time {@Viśvāmitra@} was his {@Purohita,@} and
accompanied him in his victorious raids over the {@Vipāś@}
(Beās) and {@Śutudrī@} (Sutlej).<sup>2</sup> The Aśvins gave him a queen,
{@Sudevī,@}<sup>3</sup> and also helped him on another occasion.<sup>4</sup> He
appears with {@Trasadasyu@} in a late hymn without hint of
rivalry,<sup>5</sup> but elsewhere he seems to be referred to as defeated by
{@Purukutsa,@} Trasadasyu's father.<sup>6</sup> In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>7</sup>
he is recognized as a great king, with {@Vasiṣṭha@} as his Puro
hita, and similarly in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra,<sup>8</sup> where his
generosity to his priest is related.
<div n="P"/>His exact ancestry is a little uncertain, because he is called
{@Paijavana,@} ‘son of Pijavana,’ as Yāska explains the patro-
nymic. If this explanation is correct, {@Divodāsa@} must have
been his grandfather. If he was the son of Divodāsa, Pijavana
must be understood as a more remote ancestor. The former
alternative seems the more probable. {%Cf.%} {@Turvaśa, Dāśarājña.@}
