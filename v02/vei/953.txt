1. {@Candra,@}¦<sup>1</sup> {@Candra-mas,@}<sup>2</sup> are the names of the ‘moon,’ the
latter occurring from the Rigveda onwards, but the former
being first used in this sense by the Atharvaveda. Very little is
said about the moon in Vedic literature, except as identified
with {@Soma,@}<sup>3</sup> both alike being described as waxing and waning.
Reference is, however, made to the regular changes of the
moon, and to its alternation with the sun,<sup>5</sup> to which it, as Soma,
is declared in the Rigveda to be married.<sup>6</sup> Mention is also
made of its disappearance at the time of new moon,<sup>7</sup> and of its
birth from the light of the sun.<sup>8</sup> In the Atharvaveda<sup>9</sup> reference
is made to demons eclipsing the moon ({%grahāś cāndramāsāḥ%}).
