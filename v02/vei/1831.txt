{@Pipru@}¦ is the name of a foe of Indra in the Rigveda. He
was repeatedly defeated by Indra for {@Ṛjiśvan.@}<sup>1</sup> Mentioned as
possessing forts,<sup>2</sup> he is called a Dāsa<sup>3</sup> as well as an Asura.<sup>4</sup>
He is described as having a black brood,<sup>5</sup> and as being allied
with blacks.<sup>6</sup> It is uncertain whether he was a demon, accord-
ing to Roth's<sup>7</sup> view, which is favoured by the use of the word
Asura, or a human foe, as Ludwig,<sup>8</sup> Oldenberg,<sup>9</sup> and Hillebrandt<sup>10</sup>
believe. The name may mean ‘resister,’ from the root {%pṛ.%}
