{@Atithi@}¦ (‘guest’). — A hymn of the Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> celebrates in
detail the merits of hospitality. The guest should be fed before
[Page1-015+ 50]
the host eats, water should be offered to him, and so forth.
The Taittirīya Upaniṣad<sup>2</sup> also lays stress on hospitality, using
the expression ‘one whose deity is his guest’ ({%atithi-deva%}). In
the Aitareya Āraṇyaka<sup>3</sup> it is said that only the good are deemed
worthy of receiving hospitality. The guest-offering forms a
regular part of the ritual,<sup>4</sup> and cows were regularly slain in
honour of guests.<sup>5</sup>
