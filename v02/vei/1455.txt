2. {@Dhṛtarāṣṭra Vaicitra-vīrya@}¦ (‘descendant of Vicitra-
vīrya’) is mentioned in a passage of the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,<sup>1</sup>
which is, unhappily, far from intelligible. But there is no
ground for supposing that he was a Kuru-Pañcāla king; he
seems rather to have lived at some distance from the Kuru-
Pañcālas. There is no good reason to deny his identity<sup>2</sup> with
the Dhṛtarāṣṭra of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>3</sup> king of {@Kāśi,@} who
was defeated, when he attempted to offer a horse sacrifice, by
{@Sātrājita Śatānīka.@} The fact that the latter was a {@Bharata@}
also points to Dhṛtarāṣṭra's not having been a Kuru-Pañcāla at
all. In the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā he appears as having a dispute
with {@Vaka Dālbhi;@} but even assuming that the latter was
a Pañcāla, there is nothing to hint that the former was a Kuru
or that this dispute is a sign of an early hostility of Kuru and
Pañcāla.<sup>4</sup> It is true that in the Epic {@Śantanu@} and Vicitravīrya
and Dhṛtarāṣṭra himself are all connected, but this connexion
seems to be due, as so often in the Epic, to a confused derange-
ment of great figures of the past.
