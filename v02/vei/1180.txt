{@Tūrvayāṇa@}¦ is the name of a prince mentioned in the Rigveda.
He appears by name in two passages,<sup>1</sup> and is clearly alluded
to in a third,<sup>2</sup> as an enemy of {@Atithigva, Āyu,@} and {@Kutsa.@}
With this accords the fact that the {@Pakthas@} were opposed in
the battle of the ten kings to the Tṛtsus,<sup>3</sup> and that Tūrvayāṇa
 is shown by another passage of the Rigveda<sup>4</sup> to have been
a prince of the Pakthas. He is there represented as having
been a protégé of Indra, who aided him against {@Cyavāna@} and
his guardians, the Maruts. It is not probable that he is
identical with {@Suśravas.@}<sup>5</sup>

<F>2) ii. 14, 7 (as a comparison of the
two preceding passages shows); per-
haps also viii. 53, 2. In i. 174, 3,
Tūrvayāṇa seems also to be a proper
name, though Roth, St. Petersburg
Dictionary, {%s.v.,%} here regards the word
as an adjective.</F>
