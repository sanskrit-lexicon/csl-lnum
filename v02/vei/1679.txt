{@Parā-vṛj@}¦ is a term found in four passages of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup>
in all of which it refers to a person in a forlorn condition,
while one<sup>2</sup> of them also speaks of him as going south. Sāyaṇa's<sup>3</sup>
view that the word is a proper name is most unlikely, while
Grassmann's<sup>4</sup> explanation of it as ‘cripple’ is still less probable.
[Page1-493+ 53]
Roth's<sup>5</sup> interpretation of it as ‘exile’ seems clearly right in the
passage which refers to the Parāvṛj as going south. Zimmer<sup>6</sup>
accepts Roth's view for this passage, but in the others sees
a reference to the child of a maiden exposed by her and in
danger of being eaten by insects ({%vamrī%}). This view is sup-
ported by the fact that {%parāvṛkta%} seems to have the same
sense,<sup>7</sup> and is accepted by Oldenberg.<sup>8</sup>
