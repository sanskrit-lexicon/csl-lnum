{@Pṛthi,@}¦<sup>1</sup> {@Pṛthī,@}<sup>2</sup> or {@Pṛthu@}<sup>3</sup> is the name of a semi-mythical
personage who is mentioned in the Rigveda and later as a Ṛṣi,
and more specially as the inventor of agriculture<sup>4</sup> and the lord
of both worlds, of men and of animals.<sup>5</sup> He bears in several
passages<sup>6</sup> the epithet Vainya, ‘descendant of Vena,’ and must
probably be regarded as a culture hero rather than as a real
man. According to other accounts,<sup>7</sup> he was the first of con-
secrated kings. {%Cf.%} {@Pārthiva.@}
