{@Vṛṣa-daṃśa,@}¦ ‘strong-toothed,’ is the name of the cat in the
Yajurveda Saṃhitās,<sup>1</sup> where it figures as a victim at the Aśva-
medha (‘horse sacrifice’). It also appears in the Pañcaviṃśa
Brāhmaṇa;<sup>2</sup> the fact that the sneeze of the cat is here referred
to renders it likely that the animal was already tamed. Geldner<sup>3</sup>
sees a house cat in the animal alluded to in a hymn of the
Atharvaveda<sup>4</sup> by a set of curious epithets, including {%vṛṣadatī,%}
‘strong-toothed,’ but Whitney<sup>5</sup> decisively rejects the idea that
the hymn refers to the domestic cat.
