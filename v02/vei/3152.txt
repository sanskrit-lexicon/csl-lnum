{@Śata-pati@}¦ occurs in a verse of the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>1</sup> and
the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> as an epithet of Indra, who is
described as alone the ‘lord of a hundred’ among men. To
interpret the expression as ‘lord of a hundred gods,’ as does
the commentary on the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, is obviously
impossible. It seems clear that there is a reference to an
analogous human functionary — viz., the lord of a hundred
villages, known in the later law<sup>3</sup> — who was probably at once a
judicial deputy of the sovereign and a revenue collector, an
ancient magistrate and collector.
