{@Kāla,@}¦ the generic expression for ‘time,’ first occurs in the
Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> where, however, it is used only once, in the late
tenth book. It is known to the Atharvaveda,<sup>2</sup> where Kāla has
already developed the sense of time as fate. The word is
frequent in the Brāhmaṇas,<sup>3</sup> superseding the earlier use of {@Ṛtu.@}
The more general division of time is into ‘past’ ({%bhūta%}),
‘present’ ({%bhavat%}), and ‘future’ ({%bhaviṣyat%}).<sup>4</sup> For other divisions
see {@Ahan, Māsa, Saṃvatsara.@}
