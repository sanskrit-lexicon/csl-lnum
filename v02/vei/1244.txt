{@Dakṣiṇā-patha@}¦ (lit., ‘the road to the south’), ‘the south
country,’ is found, probably as a designation of the Deccan,
as early as the Baudhāyana Dharma Sūtra,<sup>1</sup> coupled with
[Page1-337+ 45]
Surāṣṭra. A similar expression is {%dakṣiṇā padā,%} ‘with south-
ward foot,’ in the Rigveda,<sup>2</sup> referring to the place where the exile
({%parā-vṛj%}) goes on being expelled. This no doubt simply means
‘the south’ beyond the limits of the recognized Āryan world,
which even as late as the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad<sup>3</sup> appears as
bounded by the Vindhyas on the south.
