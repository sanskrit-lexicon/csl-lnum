{@Śveta-ketu@}¦ Aruṇeya<sup>1</sup> (‘descendant of {@Aruṇa@}’) or {@Auddālaki@}<sup>2</sup>
(‘son of {@Uddālaka@}’) is mentioned repeatedly in the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa and the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. In the Kauṣītaki
Upaniṣad<sup>3</sup> he appears as Śvetaketu, son of {@Āruṇi,@} and as a
{@Gautama.@} In the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> he is quoted as an
authority on the vexed question of the duty of the {@Sadasya,@} or
the seventeenth priest, at the ritual of the Kauṣītakins, to
notify errors in the sacrifice; Āruṇi, his father, is also cited.
He was a person of some originality, for he insisted on eating
honey despite the general prohibition of the use of that
delicacy by Brahmacārins or religious students.<sup>5</sup> He was a
contemporary of, and was instructed by the {@Pañcāla@} king
{@Pravāhaṇa Jaivala.@}<sup>6</sup> He was also a contemporary of {@Janaka,@}
of {@Videha,@} and figured among the Brahmin disputants at his
court.<sup>7</sup> A story is told of him in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta
Sūtra:<sup>8</sup> {@Jala Jātūkarṇya@} was lucky enough to become the
Purohita of three peoples or kings, of {@Kāśi, Kosala,@} and
{@Videha.@} Seeing this, Śvetaketu felt annoyed and reproached
his father with his excessive devotion to sacrifice, which merely
enriched and glorified others, not himself. His father replied,
forbidding him to speak thus: he had learned the true method
of sacrificing, and his ambition in life had been to discuss it
with every Brahmin.
<div n="P"/>All the references to Śvetaketu belong to the latest period of
Vedic literature. It is, therefore, not surprising that the Āpa-
stamba Dharma Sūtra<sup>9</sup> should refer to him as an Avara, or
[Page2-410+ 47]
person of later days, who still became a Ṛṣi by special merit.
His date, however, must not be fixed too low, because the
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa in which he plays so marked a part is
certainly earlier than Pāṇini, and was apparently even in that
grammarian's time believed to be an ancient work: hence
500 B.C. is probably rather too late than too early a period for
Śvetaketu as a rough approximation to a date.<sup>10</sup>

(it is to be noted that he came upon
Janaka when travelling about with some
other Brahmins: he was never settled
in the Videha country, but was clearly
a {@Kuru-Pañcāla,@} like his father);
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 7, 1,

of {%kṛtsnake brahmabandhau vyajijñāsiṣi%} is
not quite certain. But Āruṇi seems to
assert the love of knowledge, not of
material advantages accruing to the
Purohita, to have been his concern
in life.</F>
