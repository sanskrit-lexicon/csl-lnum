{@Bṛhaspati-sava@}¦ is the name of a sacrifice by which, according
to the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>1</sup> the priest who desired to become
a {@Purohita@} obtained that office. According to the Āśvalāyana
Śrauta Sūtra,<sup>2</sup> it was the sacrifice to be performed by a priest
after the {@Vājapeya,@} while the king performed the {@Rājasūya.@} In
[Page2-073+ 43]
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>3</sup> on the other hand, the Bṛhaspati-
sava is identified with the Vājapeya; but such identity is
clearly not primitive.<sup>4</sup>
