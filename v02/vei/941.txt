{@Ghṛta,@}¦ the modern Ghee or ‘clarified butter,’ is repeatedly
mentioned in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later<sup>2</sup> both as in ordinary use
and as a customary form of sacrifice. According to a citation
in Sāyaṇa's commentary on the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>3</sup> the dis-
tinction between Ghṛta and {@Sarpis@} consisted in the latter being
butter fully melted, while the former was butter melted and
hardened ({%ghanī-bhūta%}), but this distinction cannot be pressed.
Because the butter was thrown into the fire, Agni is styled
‘butter-faced’ ({%ghṛta-pratīka%}),<sup>4</sup> ‘butter-backed’ ({%ghṛta-pṛṣṭha%}),<sup>5</sup>
and ‘propitiated with butter’ ({%ghṛta-prasatta%}),<sup>6</sup> and ‘found of
butter’ ({%ghṛta-prī%}).<sup>7</sup> Water was used to purify the butter: the
waters were therefore called ‘butter-cleansing’ ({%ghṛta-pū%}).<sup>8</sup> In
the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa^9 it is said that Ājya, Ghṛta, Āyuta, and
Navanīta pertain to gods, men, Pitṛs, and embryos respectively.
