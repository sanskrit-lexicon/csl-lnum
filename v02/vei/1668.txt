{@Pathi-kṛt,@}¦ ‘path-maker,’ is not a rare epithet in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup>
and later,<sup>2</sup> showing clearly the importance naturally attached
in primitive times to the finding of roads. The frequency
[Page1-490+ 52]
with which the epithet is applied to Agni<sup>3</sup> suggests that there
is here an allusion to fire burning the primæval forest and
rendering advance possible. The god Pūṣan is {%pathi-kṛt,%} as
guarding the flocks.<sup>4</sup> The Ṛṣis,<sup>5</sup> or seers, as ‘path-makers,’
may be compared with the Roman Pontifices.

<F>4) Sāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, iii. 4, 9;
xvi. 1, 17. The Sūtra, xvi. 1, 18, ex-
plains {%pathi-kṛt%} merely as {%adhipati,%}
‘lord’; but the sense must be more
pregnant than that.</F>
<F>5) Rv. x. 14, 15, where the expression
refers to their finding the way to the
heavenly world; but it is probably a
transfer of an epithet of terrestrial
application.</F>
