{@Pesas@}¦ denotes in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later<sup>2</sup> an embroidered
garment such as a female dancer would wear.<sup>3</sup> The fondness
of the Indians for such raiment is noted by Megasthenes<sup>4</sup> and
by Arrian,<sup>5</sup> who refer to their <lang n="greek">ἐσθής κατάστικτος</lang>. So in one
passage<sup>6</sup> a garment ({%vastra%}) is called {%peśana,%} with which Roth<sup>7</sup>
happily compares the Roman {%vestis coloribus intexta.%} The
making of such garments was a regular occupation of women,
as is indicated by the Peśas-kārī, the ‘female embroiderer,’
figuring in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human
sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda,<sup>8</sup> though the, commentator on the
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa interprets the word as ‘wife of a maker
of gold.’<sup>9</sup> Pischel,<sup>10</sup> however, thinks that Peśas never means
anything but colour or form.

{%peśalam%} in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa,
iii. 3, 4, 5, where {%peśala%} probably refers
to cunningly-worked gold. But this
does not suit the compound {%peśas-kārī,%}
which must denote a ‘maker of {%peśas,%}’
and {%peśas%} has not the sense of wrought
gold in any passage. {%Cf.%} also Bṛhad-
