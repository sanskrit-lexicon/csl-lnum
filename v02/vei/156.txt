{@Alāyya@}¦ is a word occurring in an obscure verse of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup>
and appearing to be a proper name. Hillebrandt,<sup>2</sup> however,
amends the text so as to remove the name. The St. Petersburg
Dictionary suggests that it refers to Indra. Pischel<sup>3</sup> holds that
[Page1-039+ 51]
it is the name of a person whose axe was stolen, and for whom
the hymn was written as a spell for the recovery of the axe.
