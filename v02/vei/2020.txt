{@Pra-maganda@}¦ is the name of a prince in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> where
he is mentioned as the king of the {@Kīkaṭas,@} and where he
seems to be designated by the epithet {%naicāśākha,%} ‘belonging
to a low branch or race.’ On the other hand, Yāska<sup>2</sup> takes
Pramaganda to mean the ‘son of a usurer,’ an explanation that
is hardly probable. Hillebrandt<sup>3</sup> thinks that {%naicāśākha%} refers
not to Pramaganda, but to the Soma plant, the plant being
called {%nīcāśākha,%} ‘having shoots turned downwards,’ and that
the passage refers to a raid against the Kīkaṭas, who were not
observers of the milk cult or the Soma cult, with the intention
of winning their lands where the Soma grew and where there
were cows. Böhtlingk,<sup>4</sup> however, questions this view, which is
not very probable. A place name is possibly meant by Naicā-
śākha.<sup>5</sup> The name Pramaganda seems un-Āryan.
