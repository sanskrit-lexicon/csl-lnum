{@Hiraṇya@}¦ in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later<sup>2</sup> denotes ‘gold.’ It is
hardly possible to exaggerate the value attached to gold by the
Vedic Indians. The metal was, it is clear, won from the bed of
rivers. Hence the Indus is called ‘golden’<sup>3</sup> and ‘of golden
stream.’<sup>4</sup> Apparently the extraction of gold from the earth was
known,<sup>5</sup> and washing for gold is also recorded.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>Gold is the object of the wishes of the Vedic singer,<sup>7</sup> and
golden treasures ({%hiraṇyāni%}) are mentioned as given by patrons<sup>8</sup>
along with cows and horses. Gold was used for ornaments for
neck and breast ({@Niṣka@}), for ear-rings ({@Karṇa-śobhana@}), and
even for cups.<sup>9</sup> Gold is always associated with the gods.<sup>10</sup>
[Page2-505+ 62]
<div n="P"/>In the plural Hiraṇya denotes ‘ornaments of gold.’<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>A gold currency was evidently beginning to be known in so
far as definite weights of gold are mentioned: thus a weight,
{%aṣṭā-prūḍ,%} occurs in the Saṃhitās,<sup>12</sup> and the golden {%śatamāna,%}
‘weight of a hundred ({@Kṛṣṇalas@})’ is found in the same texts.<sup>13</sup>
In several passages,<sup>14</sup> moreover, {%hiraṇya%} or {%hiraṇyāni%} may mean
‘pieces of gold.’
<div n="P"/>Gold is described sometimes as {%harita,%}<sup>15</sup> ‘yellowish,’ some-
times as {%rajata,%}<sup>16</sup> ‘whitish,’ when probably. ‘silver’ is alluded
to. It was obtained from the ore by smelting.<sup>17</sup> Mega-
sthenes<sup>18</sup> bears testimony to the richness in gold of India in
his time.
