{@Devaka Mānyamāna@}¦ (‘descendant of Manyamāna’) appears
in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as an opponent of the Tṛtsus, and as connected
with Śambara. Possibly, however, as Grassmann suggests,
the words should be understood as denoting Śambara, ‘who
deemed himself a god,’ {%devaka%} being used contemptuously.<sup>2</sup>
