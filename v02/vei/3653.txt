{@Sūrya-nakṣatra@}¦ is found in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> in a
passage where Sāyaṇa takes it as denoting a {@Nakṣatra,@} which
gives out rays of light like the sun. But the real sense (as the
Kāṇva text helps to show) is that the sacrificer may take the
sun for his Nakṣatra — {%i.e.,%} he may neglect the Nakṣatras
altogether and rely on the sun.
