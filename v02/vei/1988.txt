{@Prati-pra-sthātṛ@}¦ is the name of a priest ({@Ṛtvij@}), one of the
assistants of the Adhvaryu, in the later Saṃhitās and the
Brāhmaṇas.<sup>1</sup> He is not mentioned in the Rigveda,<sup>2</sup> but
mention is once made in that Saṃhitā<sup>3</sup> of the two Adhvaryus.
These may have meant, as later, the Adhvaryu and the Prati-
prasthātṛ. Oldenberg,<sup>4</sup> however, thinks that the Adhvaryu and
the Agnīdh are intended, a conjecture for which there is some
authority.<sup>5</sup>
