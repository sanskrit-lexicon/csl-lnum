<L>1822<pc>1-530<k1>pitrya<k2>pitrya
{@Pitrya@}¦ occurs in the list of sciences given in the Chāndogya
Upaniṣad.<sup>1</sup> Apparently it is to be taken as the science relating
to the cult of the Manes, as explained by Śaṅkara in his
commentary. As it is in that list followed by {@Rāśi,@} the
St. Petersburg Dictionary is inclined to take Pitrya Rāśi as one
expression, but in what exact sense does not appear.
