{@Bekanāṭa@}¦ occurs only once in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> when Indra is
said to overcome all the Bekanāṭas and the Paṇis. The natural
sense, therefore, seems to be ‘usurer,’ the explanation given by
Yāska.<sup>2</sup> The word has a foreign appearance, but its provenance
can hardly be determined: it might just as well be aboriginal
as Babylonian.<sup>3</sup> Hillebrandt<sup>4</sup> thinks Brunnhofer is right in
identifying Bekanāṭa with Bikanir.
