{@Āṇi.@}¦ — This word, which is found in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> but rarely
later,<sup>2</sup> appears to be best taken with Roth<sup>3</sup> and Zimmer<sup>4</sup> as
denoting the part of the axle of the chariot which is inserted
into the nave of the wheel. Sāyaṇa renders it as lynch-pin,
and this sense is accepted by Leumann,<sup>5</sup> being apparently also
found in the Nirukta.<sup>6</sup> In one place in the Rigveda<sup>7</sup> the
word appears by synecdoche to denote the whole chariot, but
the passage is, according to Geldner,<sup>8</sup> completely obscure.
