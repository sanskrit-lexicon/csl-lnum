{@Bhṛgu@}¦ is a sage of almost entirely mythical character in the
Rigveda and later. He counts as a son of Varuṇa,<sup>1</sup> bearing
the patronymic Vāruṇi.<sup>2</sup> In the plural the Bhṛgus are
repeatedly<sup>3</sup> alluded to as devoted to the fire cult. They are
clearly<sup>4</sup> no more than a group of ancient priests and ancestors
with an eponymous Bhṛgu<sup>5</sup> in the Rigveda, except in three
passages,<sup>6</sup> where they are evidently regarded as an historic
family. It is not clear, however, whether they were priests or
warriors: in the battle of the ten kings the Bhṛgus appear with
the {@Druhyus,@} perhaps as their priests, but this is not certain.<sup>7</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the later literature the Bhṛgus are a real family, with sub-
divisions like the {@Aitaśāyana,@} according to the Kauṣītaki
Brāhmaṇa.<sup>8</sup> The Bhṛgus are mentioned as priests in connexion
with various rites, such as the Agnisthāpana<sup>9</sup> and the Daśa-
peyakratu.<sup>10</sup> In many passages they are conjoined with the
{@Aṅgirases.@}<sup>11</sup> the close association of the two families is shown
[Page2-110+ 43]
by the fact that Cyavana is called either a Bhārgava or an
Āṅgirasa in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>12</sup> In the Atharvaveda<sup>13</sup>
the name of Bhṛgu is selected to exemplify the dangers incurred
by the oppressors of Brahmans: the {@Sṛñjaya Vaitahavyas@}
perish in consequence of an attack on Bhṛgu. In the Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa<sup>14</sup> also Bhṛgu has this representative character. {%Cf.%}

{%Vedic Mythology,%} 51. The legend of
their chariot-making (Rv. iv. 16, 20;
x. 39, 14) may be due, as Roth, St.
Petersburg Dictionary, {%s.v.,%} suggests,
to a confusion with the Ṛbhus. It
may, however, be an allusion to the
historic Bhṛgus, whom we find in the
battle of the ten kings.</F>

sense, an interpretation which may be
correct, but is not necessary.</F>

which list, given by Macdonell, {%loc. cit.,%}
Roth adds viii. 102, 4, {%Aurva-Bhṛgu-vat,%}
‘like Aurva and Bhṛgu.’ {%Cf.%} the fact
that the {@Aurvas,@} in the Aitareya Brāh-

of the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxx. 5.</F>
<F>7) In viii. 3, 9; 6, 18; 102, 4, the
reference to a priestly family is the
more natural; in vii. 18, 6, warriors
may be meant. {%Cf.%} Hopkins, {%Journal%}

perhaps denoting the same thing.</F>

Hence, in the Atharvanic ritual texts,

the Atharvaveda (Bloomfield, {%Atharva-%}
