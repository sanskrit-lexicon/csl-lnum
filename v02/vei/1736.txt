{@Palita,@}¦ ‘grey-haired,’ occurs frequently from the Rigveda<sup>1</sup>
onwards.<sup>2</sup> It is the distinctive sign of old age. Those who,
like certain descendants of {@Jamadagni,@} do not grow old,<sup>3</sup> are
said not to become grey-haired, while {@Bharadvāja@} is described
as having in his old age become thin and grey-haired.<sup>4</sup> The
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>5</sup> in one passage observes that grey hairs
appear first on the head, and elsewhere<sup>6</sup> alludes to the hair on
the arms having become grey.
