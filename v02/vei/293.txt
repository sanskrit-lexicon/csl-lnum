{@Ā-sandī.@}¦ — This is a generic term for a seat of some sort,
occurring frequently in the later Saṃhitās<sup>1</sup> and Brāhmaṇas.<sup>2</sup>
but not in the Rigveda. In the Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> the settle brought
for the {@Vrātya@} is described at length. It had two feet, lengths
wise and cross-pieces, forward and cross-cords, showing that it
was made of wood and also cording. It was also covered with
a cushion ({@Āstaraṇa@}) and a pillow ({@Upabarhaṇa@}), had a seat
({@Āsāda@}) and a support ({@Upaśraya@}). Similar seats are described
in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad<sup>4</sup> and the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>5</sup>
The seat for the king at the royal consecration is described in
very similar terms in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>6</sup> where the
height of the feet is placed at a span, and the lengthwise and
cross-pieces are each to be a cubit, while the interwoven part
({%vivayana%}) is to be of Muñja grass, and the seat of Udumbara
wood. In another passage of the Atharvaveda<sup>7</sup> Lanman
seems to take the seat meant as a ‘long reclining chair.’ There
also a cushion ({@Upadhāna@}) and coverlet ({@Upavāsana@}) are
mentioned. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa repeatedly describes
the Āsandī in terms showing that it was an elaborate seat. In
one place<sup>8</sup> it is said to be made of Khadira wood, perforated
({%vi-tṛṇṇā%}), and joined with straps ({%vardhra-yutā%}) like that of the
Bhāratas. At the Sautrāmaṇī rite<sup>9</sup> (an Indra sacrifice) the
seat is of Udumbara wood, is knee-high, and of unlimited
width and depth, and is covered with plaited reed-work. The
[Page1-072+ 40]
imperial seat<sup>10</sup> is to be shoulder-high, of Udumbara wood, and
wound all over with cords of Balvaja grass ({%Eleusina indica%}).
Elsewhere<sup>11</sup> the seat is a span high, a cubit in width and
depth, of Udumbara wood, and covered with reed-grass cords,
and daubed with clay.
