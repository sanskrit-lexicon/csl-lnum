{@Aṅgiras.@}¦ — The Aṅgirases appear in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as semi-
mythical beings, and no really historical character can be
assigned even to those passages<sup>2</sup> which recognize a father of
the race, Aṅgiras. Later, however, there were definite families
of Aṅgirases, to whose ritual practices ({%ayana, dvirātra%}) references
are made.<sup>3</sup>
