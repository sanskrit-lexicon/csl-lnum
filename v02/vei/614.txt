1. {@Kirāta@}¦ is a name applied to a people living in the caves
of the mountains, as appears clearly from the dedication of the
Kirāta to the caves ({%guhā%}) in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,<sup>1</sup> and
from the reference in the Atharvaveda<sup>2</sup> to a Kirāta girl ({%kairā-%}
{%tikā%}), who digs a remedy on the ridges of the mountains.
[Page1-158+ 54]
Later<sup>3</sup> the people called Kirātas were located in Eastern Nepal,
but the name seems to have been applied to any hill folk, no
doubt aborigines, though the Mānava Dharma Śāstra<sup>4</sup> regards
them as degraded Kṣatriyas.
