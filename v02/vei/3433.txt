{@Saṃ-grāma@}¦ denotes primarily, it seems, ‘assembly’ either in
peace<sup>1</sup> or in war,<sup>2</sup> when it means an ‘armed band.’ Its normal
sense in the Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> and later<sup>4</sup> is ‘war,’ ‘battle.’
[Page2-417+ 50]
<div n="P"/>Little is known of Vedic warfare, but it seems to have been
simple. A body of foot soldiers with charioteers composed
every army, the two going together,<sup>5</sup> and the foot soldiers being
often overthrown by the charioteers,<sup>6</sup> who were doubtless
the Kṣatriyas and their foremost retainers. Probably the
foot soldiers bore little armour, and used only the bow for
offence, as is suggested by the account that Herodotus gives of
the Indian contingent of the army with which Xerxes invaded
Greece.<sup>7</sup> The nobles, on the other hand, may have had cuirass
({@Varman@}), helmet ({@Śiprā@}), and hand-guard ({@Hastaghna@}) as a
protection from the friction of the bowstring. On the car was
the charioteer, and on his left the warrior ({@Sārathi, Savyaṣṭhā@}).
Riding is never mentioned in war,<sup>8</sup> and would hardly have
been suited to Vedic ideas, for the warrior mainly depended on
his bow, which he could not have used effectively from horse-
back. The offensive weapon ({@Āyudha@}) was practically the
bow; spear and sword and axe were very seldom used.
<div n="P"/>Whether there was a strict tribal organization of the host,
such as is once alluded to in the Homeric poems,<sup>9</sup> and is also
recognized in Germany by Tacitus,<sup>10</sup> is uncertain ({%cf.%} {@Vrāta@}),
but in the Epic relations ({@Jñāti@}) fight together,<sup>11</sup> and this rule,
no doubt, applied more or less in Vedic times also.
<div n="P"/>Cities were besieged and invested ({%upa-sad, pra-bhid%}),<sup>12</sup>
probably as a rule by blockade, since the ineffective means of
assault of the time would have rendered storming difficult and
expensive. Hillebrandt<sup>13</sup> thinks that the {%pur cariṣṇū%} of the
Rigveda<sup>14</sup> was a kind of chariot; it may — like the Trojan
horse — have been an Indian anticipation of the Roman means
of assaulting a town.
<div n="P"/>Besides ordinary wars of defence and conquest, raids into
[Page2-418+ 50]
neighbouring territory seem to have been frequent and normal,<sup>15</sup>
no doubt because of the booty ({@Udāja, Nirāja@}) which was to be
won, and which the king had to share with the people.
<div n="P"/>Banners ({@Dhvaja@}) were borne in war, and musical instru-
ments ({@Dundubhi, Bakura@})<sup>16</sup> were used by the combatants.
