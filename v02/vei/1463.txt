{@Dhruva@}¦ in the Sūtras<sup>1</sup> denotes the pole star, being mentioned
in connexion with the marriage ritual, in which the star is
pointed out to the bride as an emblem of constancy. In the
[Page1-406+ 49]
Maitrāyaṇī Upaniṣad,<sup>2</sup> a late work, the movement of the
Dhruva ({%dhruvasya pracalanam%}) is mentioned, but this can hardly
be interpreted as referring to an actual observed motion of the
nominal pole star,<sup>3</sup> but rather to an extraordinary event, such
as a destruction of the world, as Cowell understood the
expression.<sup>4</sup> Jacobi<sup>5</sup> sees in the motion of the Dhruva the
possibility of fixing a date, on the ground that the only star
which could have been deemed a pole star, as ‘immovable,’ was
one ({%a%} Draconis) of the third millennium B.C. But this attempt
to extract chronology from the name of the star is of very
doubtful validity.<sup>6</sup>

It is to be noted that the marriage
Mantras, of which we have a great
many, do not include any reference to
the Dhruva; but it is not possible to
say definitely whether the practice is
really an old one or not</F>
