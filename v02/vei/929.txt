{@Grāma.@}¦ — The primitive sense of this word, which occurs
frequently from the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> onwards, appears to have been
‘village.’ The Vedic Indians must have dwelt in villages which
were scattered over the country, some close together,<sup>2</sup> some far
apart, and were connected by roads.<sup>3</sup> The village is regularly
contrasted with the forest ({%araṇya%}), and its animals and plants
with those that lived or grew wild in the woods.<sup>4</sup> The villages
contained cattle, horses, and other domestic animals, as well as
men.<sup>5</sup> Grain was also stored in them.<sup>6</sup> In the evening the
cattle regularly returned thither from the forest.<sup>7</sup> The villages
were probably open, though perhaps a fort ({@Pur@}) might on
[Page1-245+ 58]
occasion be built inside.<sup>8</sup> Presumably they consisted of
detached houses with enclosures, but no details are to be found
in Vedic literature. Large villages ({%mahāgrāmāḥ%}) were known.<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>The relation of the villagers is difficult to ascertain with
precision. In several passages<sup>10</sup> the word occurs with what
appears to be the derivative sense of ‘body of men.’ This
sense presumably started from the use of the word to denote
the ‘village folk,’ as when {@Śaryāta Mānava@} is said in the
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>11</sup> to have wandered about with his
‘village’ ({%grāmeṇa%}); but, as Zimmer<sup>12</sup> observes, this restricted
sense nowhere appears clearly in the Rigveda,<sup>13</sup> where indeed
the ‘folk’ ({%jana%})<sup>14</sup> of the Bharatas is in one passage<sup>15</sup> called
the ‘horde seeking cows’ ({%gavyan grāmaḥ%}). Zimmer<sup>16</sup> tends to
regard the Grāma as a clan, and as standing midway between
the family and the tribe ({@Viś@}). The Grāma may, however,
perhaps be regarded more correctly<sup>17</sup> as an aggregate of several
families, not necessarily forming a clan, but only part of a clan
({@Viś@}), as is often the case at the present day.<sup>18</sup>
<div n="P"/>Vedic literature tells us very little about the social economy
of the village. There is nothing to show that the community
as such held land. What little evidence there is indicates that
individual tenure of land was known (see {@Urvarā, Kṣetra@}), but
this, in effect though not in law, presumably meant tenure by a
family rather than by an individual person. The expression
[Page1-246+ 58]
‘desirous of a village’ ({%grāma-kāma%}), which occurs frequently in
the later Saṃhitās,<sup>19</sup> points, however, to the practice of the king's
granting to his favourites his royal prerogatives over villages so
far as fiscal matters were concerned. Later<sup>20</sup> the idea developed
that the king was owner of all the land, and parallel with that
idea the view that the holders of such grants were landlords.
But of either idea there is no vestige in Vedic literature beyond
the word {%grāma-kāma,%} which much more probably refers to the
grant of regalia than to the grant of land, as Teutonic parallels
show.<sup>21</sup> Such grants probably tended to depress the position
of the actual cultivators, and to turn them into tenants, but
they can hardly have had this effect to any appreciable extent
in early times.
<div n="P"/>The village does not appear to have been a unit for legal
purposes in early days,<sup>22</sup> and it can hardly be said to have been
a political unit. The village no doubt, as later, included in its
members various menials, besides the cultivating owners, and
also the Brāhmaṇas and Kṣatriyas who might hold interest
in it by royal grant or usage without actually cultivating land,
such as chariot-makers ({@Ratha-kāra@}), carpenters ({@Takṣan@}),
smiths ({@Karmāra@}), and others, but they did not presumably, in
any sense, form part of the brotherhood.<sup>23</sup> All alike were
politically subject to the king, and bound to render him food or
service or other tribute, unless he had transferred his rights to
[Page1-247+ 60]
others of the royal family or household, as was no doubt often
the case, either in whole or part. The king's share in a village
is referred to as early as the Atharvaveda.<sup>24</sup>
<div n="P"/>At the head of the village was the Grāma-ṇī, or ‘leader of
the village,’ who is referred to in the Rigveda,<sup>25</sup> and often in
the later Saṃhitās and in the Brāhmaṇas.<sup>26</sup> The exact
meaning of the title is not certain. By Zimmer<sup>27</sup> the Grāmaṇī
is regarded as having had military functions only, and he is
certainly often connected with the {@Senānī,@} or ‘leader of an
army.’ But there is no reason so to restrict the sense: pre-
sumably the Grāmaṇī was the head of the village both for civil
purposes and for military operations. He is ranked in the
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>28</sup> as inferior to the {@Sūta,@} or ‘charioteer,’
with whom, however, he is associated<sup>29</sup> as one of the {@Ratnins,@}
the ‘jewels’ of the royal establishment. The post was especially
valuable to a Vaiśya, who, if he attained it, was at the summit
of prosperity ({%gataśrī%}).<sup>30</sup> The Grāmaṇī's connexion with the
royal person seems to point to his having been a nominee of
the king rather than a popularly elected officer. But the post
may have been sometimes hereditary, and sometimes nomi-
nated or elective: there is no decisive evidence available.
The use of the singular presents difficulties: possibly the
Grāmaṇī of the village or city where the royal residence was
situated was specially honoured and influential.<sup>31</sup>

<F>17) A village might contain a whole
clan, but probably it contained at most
a section of a clan. By family is meant
a Hindu joint family; but the extent
to which such families existed, and the
number of persons included, cannot
even be conjectured from the avail

village council or a hereditary officer,
because the appointment is only claimed
for the king in late authorities like
Manu, vii. 115. But there is not even
so much authority for election or
heredity, and we really cannot say
how far the power of the early princes
extended: it probably varied very
much. {%Cf.%} {@Rājan@} and {@Citraratha.@}</F>
