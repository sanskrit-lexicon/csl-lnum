1. {@Brāhmaṇa,@}¦ ‘descendant of a Brahman’ ({%i.e.,%} of a priest), is
found only a few times in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> and mostly in its latest
[Page2-081+ 64]
parts. In the Atharvaveda<sup>2</sup> and later<sup>3</sup> it is a very common
word denoting ‘priest,’ and it appears in the quadruple division
of the castes in the Puruṣa-sūkta (‘hymn of man’) of the
Rigveda.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>It seems certain that in the Rigveda this Brāhmaṇa, or
Brahmin, is already a separate caste, differing from the warrior
and agricultural castes.<sup>5</sup> The texts regularly claim for them a
superiority to the {@Kṣatriya@} caste,<sup>6</sup> and the Brahmin is able by
his spells or manipulation of the rite to embroil the people and
the warriors<sup>7</sup> or the different sections of the warriors.<sup>8</sup> If it
is necessary to recognize, as is sometimes done, that the
Brahmin does pay homage to the king at the {@Rājasūya,@}<sup>9</sup>
nevertheless the unusual fact is carefully explained away so
as to leave the priority of the Brahmin unaffected. But it
is expressly recognized that the union of the Kṣatriya and
the Brāhmaṇa is essential for complete prosperity.<sup>10</sup> It is
admitted<sup>11</sup> that the king or the nobles might at times oppress
the Brahmins, but it is indicated that ruin is then certain
swiftly to follow.
[Page2-082+ 55]
<div n="P"/>The Brahmins are gods on earth,<sup>12</sup> like the gods in heaven,
but this claim is hardly found in the Rigveda.<sup>13</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>14</sup> the Brahmin is said to be the
‘recipient of gifts’ ({%ādāyī%}) and the ‘drinker of the offering’
({%āpāyī%}). The other two epithets applied, {%āvasāyī%} and {%yathā-%}
{%kāma-prayāpya,%} are more obscure; the former denotes either
‘dwelling everywhere’<sup>15</sup> or ‘seeking food’;<sup>16</sup> the latter is usually
taken as ‘moving at pleasure,’ but it must rather allude to the
power of the king to assign a place of residence to the Brahmin.
<div n="P"/>In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>17</sup> the prerogatives of the Brah-
min are summed up as (1) Arcā, ‘honour’; (2) Dāna, ‘gifts’;
(3) Ajyeyatā, ‘freedom from oppression’; and (4) Avadhyatā,
‘freedom from being killed.’ On the other hand, his duties
are summed up as (5) Brāhmaṇya, ‘purity of descent’;
(6) Pratirūpa-caryā, ‘devotion of the duties of his caste’; and
(7) Loka-pakti, ‘the perfecting of people’ (by teaching).
<div n="P"/>1. {%Respect paid to Brahmins.%} — The texts are full<sup>18</sup> of references
to the civilities to be paid to the Brahmin. He is styled
{%bhagavant,%}<sup>19</sup> and is provided with good food<sup>20</sup> and entertain-
ment wherever he goes. Indeed, his sanctity exempts him
from any close inquiry into his real claim to Brahminhood
according to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.<sup>21</sup>
<div n="P"/>2. {%Gifts to Brahmins.%} — The Dānastuti (‘Praise of gifts’) is a
recognized feature of the Rigveda, and the greed of the poets
for {@Dakṣiṇās,@} or sacrificial fees, is notorious. Vedic texts<sup>22</sup>
themselves recognize that the literature thence resulting ({@Nārā-@}
[Page2-083+ 56]
{@śaṃsī@}) was often false to please the donors. It was, however,
a rule<sup>23</sup> that Brahmins should not accept what had been
refused by others; this indicates a keen sense of the danger of
cheapening their wares. So exclusively theirs was the right to
receive gifts that the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>24</sup> has to explain
how {@Taranta@} and {@Purumīḷha@} became able to accept gifts by
composing a Rigvedic hymn.<sup>25</sup> The exaggerations in the
celebration of the gifts bestowed on the priests has the curious
result of giving us a series of numerals of some interest ({@Daśan@}).
In some passages<sup>26</sup> certain gifts — those of a horse or sheep — are
forbidden, but this rule was not, it is clear, generally observed.
<div n="P"/>3. {%Immunities of Brahmins.%} — The Brahmin claimed to be
exempt from the ordinary exercise of the royal power. When
a king gives all his land and what is on it to the priests, the gift
does not cover the property of the Brahmin according to the
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>27</sup> The king censures all, but not the
Brahmin,<sup>28</sup> nor can he safely oppress any Brahmin other than
an ignorant priest.<sup>29</sup> An arbitrator (or a witness) must decide
(or speak) for a Brahmin against a non-Brahmin in a legal
dispute.<sup>30</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Brahmin's proper food is the {@Soma,@}<sup>31</sup> not {@Surā@}<sup>32</sup> or
{@Parisrut,@}<sup>33</sup> and he is forbidden to eat certain forms of flesh.<sup>34</sup>
On the other hand, he alone is allowed to eat the remains of
the sacrifice,<sup>35</sup> for no one else is sufficiently holy to consume
food which the gods have eaten. Moreover, though he cannot
be a physician,<sup>36</sup> he helps the physician by being beside him
[Page2-084+ 56]
while he exercises his art.<sup>37</sup> His wife<sup>38</sup> and his cow<sup>39</sup> are both
sacred.
<div n="P"/>4. {%Legal Position of Brahmins.%} — The Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>40</sup>
lays down a penalty of a hundred (the unit meant is unknown)
for an insult to a Brahmin, and of a thousand for a blow; but
if his blood is drawn, the penalty is a spiritual one. The only
real murder is the slaying of a Brahmin according to the
Satapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>41</sup> The crime of slaying a Brahmin ranks
above the sin of killing any other man, but below that of killing
an embryo ({%bhrūṇa%}) in the Yajurveda;<sup>42</sup> the crime of slaying an
embryo whose sex is uncertain is on a level with that of slaying
a Brahmin.<sup>43</sup> The murder of a Brahmin can be expiated only
by the horse sacrifice,<sup>44</sup> or by a lesser rite in the late Taittirīya
Āraṇyaka.<sup>45</sup> The ritual slaying of a Brahmin is allowed in the
later ceremonial,<sup>46</sup> and hinted at in the curious legend of
{@Śunaḥśepa;@}<sup>47</sup> and a Purohita might be punished with death for
treachery to his master.<sup>48</sup>
<div n="P"/>5. {%Purity of Birth.%} — The importance of pure descent is seen
in the stress laid on being a descendant of a Ṛṣi ({%ārṣeya%}).<sup>49</sup> But,
on the other hand, there are clear traces of another doctrine,
which requires learning, and not physical descent, as the true
criterion of Ṛṣihood.<sup>50</sup> In agreement with this is the fact
that {@Satyakāma Jābāla@} was received as a pupil, though his
parentage was unknown, his mother being a slave girl who had
been connected with several men,<sup>51</sup> and that in the Śatapatha
[Page2-085+ 59]
Brāhmaṇa<sup>52</sup> the ceremony on acceptance as a pupil required
merely the name of the pupil. So {@Kavaṣa@} is taunted in the
Rigveda Brāhmaṇas<sup>53</sup> as being the son of a female slave ({@Dāsī@}),
and {@Vatsa@} cleared himself of a similar imputation by a fire
ordeal.<sup>54</sup> Moreover, a very simple rite was adequate to remove
doubts as to origin.<sup>55</sup> In these circumstances it is doubtful
whether much value attaches to the {@Pravara@} lists in which the
ancestors of the priest were invoked at the beginning of the
sacrifice by the Hotṛ and the Adhvaryu priests.<sup>56</sup> Still, in
many parts of the ritual the knowledge of two or more genera-
tions was needed,<sup>57</sup> and in one ceremony<sup>58</sup> ten ancestors who
have drunk the Soma are required, but a literal performance of
the rite is excused. Moreover, there are clear traces of ritual
variations in schools, like those of the {@Vasiṣṭhas@} and the
{@Viśvāmitras.@}
<div n="P"/>6. {%The Conduct of the Brahmin.%} — The Brahmin was required
to maintain a fair standard of excellence.<sup>59</sup> He was to be kind
to all<sup>60</sup> and gentle,<sup>61</sup> offering sacrifice and receiving gifts.<sup>62</sup>
Especial stress was laid on purity of speech;<sup>63</sup> thus {@Viśvan-@}
{@tara's@} excuse for excluding the {@Śyāparṇas@} from his retinue was
their impure ({%apūtā%}) speech.<sup>64</sup> Theirs was the craving for
knowledge<sup>65</sup> and the life of begging.<sup>66</sup> False Brahmins are
those who do not fulfil their duties<sup>67</sup> ({%cf.%} {@Brahmabandhu@}) .
[Page2-086+ 58]
But the penances for breach of duty are, in the Sūtras, of a
very light and unimportant character.<sup>68</sup>
<div n="P"/>7. {%Brahminical Studies.%} — The aim of the priest is to obtain
pre-eminence in sacred knowledge ({%brahma-varcasam%}), as is
stated in numerous passages of Vedic literature.<sup>69</sup> Such
distinction is not indeed confined to the Brahmin: the king
has it also, but it is not really in a special manner appropriate
to the Kṣatriya.<sup>70</sup> Many ritual acts are specified as leading to
Brahmavarcasa,<sup>71</sup> but more stress is laid on the study of the
sacred texts: the importance of such study is repeatedly
insisted upon.<sup>72</sup>
<div n="P"/>The technical name for study is Svādhyāya: the Satapatha
Brāhmaṇa is eloquent upon its advantages,<sup>73</sup> and it is asserted
that the joy of the learned Śrotriya, or ‘student,’ is equal to
the highest joy possible.<sup>74</sup> {@Nāka Maudgalya@} held that study
and the teaching of others were the true penance ({%tapas%}).<sup>75</sup> The
object was the ‘threefold knowledge’ ({%trayī vidyā%}), that of the
Ṛc, Yajus, and Sāman,<sup>76</sup> a student of all three Vedas being
called {%tri-śukriya%}<sup>77</sup> or {%tri-śukra,%}<sup>78</sup> ‘thrice pure.’ Other objects
of study are enumerated in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>79</sup> in the
Taittirīya Āraṇyaka,<sup>80</sup> the Chāndogya Upaniṣad,<sup>81</sup> etc. (See
{@Itihāsa, Purāṇa; Gāthā, Nārāśaṃsī; Brahmodya; Anuśās-@}
{@ana, Anuvyākhyāna, Anvākhyāna, Kalpa,@} 2. {@Brāhmaṇa;@}
{@Vidyā, Kṣatravidyā, Devajanavidyā, Nakṣatravidyā, Bhūta-@}
{@vidyā, Sarpavidyā; Atharvāṅgirasaḥ, Daiva, Nidhi, Pitrya,@}
{@Rāśi; Sūtra,@} etc.)
[Page2-087+ 55]
<div n="P"/>Directions as to the exact place and time of study are given
in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka<sup>82</sup> and in the Sūtras. If study is
carried on in the village, it is to be done silently ({%manasā%}); if
outside, aloud ({%vācā%}).
<div n="P"/>Learning is expected even from persons not normally com-
petent as teachers, such as the {@Carakas,@} who are recognized in
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>83</sup> as possible sources of information.
Here, too, may be mentioned the cases of Brahmins learning
from princes, though their absolute value is doubtful, for the
priests would naturally represent their patrons as interested in
their sacred science: it is thus not necessary to see in these
notices any real and independent study on the part of the
Kṣatriyas.<sup>84</sup> {@Yājñavalkya@} learnt from {@Janaka,@}<sup>85</sup> {@Uddālaka@}
{@Āruṇi@} and two other Brahmins from {@Pravāhaṇa Jaivali,@}<sup>86</sup>
{@Dṛptabālāki Gārgya@} from {@Ajātaśatru,@}<sup>87</sup> and five Brahmins
under the lead of Aruṇa from {@Aśvapati Kaikeya.@}<sup>88</sup> A few
notices show the real educators of thought: wandering scholars
went through the country<sup>89</sup> and engaged in disputes and
discussions in which a prize was staked by the disputants.<sup>90</sup>
Moreover, kings like Janaka offered rewards to the most learned
of the Brahmins;<sup>91</sup> Ajātaśatru was jealous of his renown, and
imitated his generosity. Again, learned women are several
times mentioned in the Brāhmaṇas.<sup>92</sup>
<div n="P"/>A special form of disputation was the {@Brahmodya,@} for which
there was a regular place at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’)<sup>93</sup>
and at the Daśarātra (‘ten-day festival’).<sup>94</sup> The reward of
learning was the gaining of the title of Kavi or Vipra, ‘sage.’<sup>95</sup>
[Page2-088+ 56]
<div n="P"/>8. {%The Functions of the Brahmin.%} — The Brahmin was required
not merely to practise individual culture, but also to give
others the advantage of his skill, either as a teacher or as a
sacrificial priest, or as a Purohita.
<div n="P"/>As a teacher the Brahmin has, of course, the special duty of
instructing his own son in both study and sacrificial ritual.<sup>96</sup>
The texts give examples of this, such as Āruṇi and {@Śvetaketu,@}<sup>97</sup>
or mythically Varuṇa and Bhṛgu.<sup>98</sup> This fact also appears
from some of the names in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>99</sup> of the
Sāmaveda and the Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Śāṅkhāyana
Āraṇyaka.<sup>100</sup> On the other hand, these Vaṃśas and the
Vaṃśas of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa show that a father often
preferred to let his son study under a famous teacher. The
relation of pupil and teacher is described under {@Brahmacarya.@}
A teacher might take several pupils,<sup>101</sup> and he was bound to
teach them with all his heart and soul.<sup>102</sup> He was bound to
reveal everything to his pupil, at any rate to one who was
staying with him for a year ({%saṃvatsara-vāsin%}),<sup>103</sup> an expression
which shows, as was natural, that a pupil might easily
change teachers. But, nevertheless, certain cases of learning
kept secret and only revealed to special persons are enumer-
ated.<sup>104</sup> The exact times and modes of teaching are elaborately
laid down in the Sūtras,<sup>105</sup> but not in the earlier texts.
<div n="P"/>As priest the Brahmin operated in all the greater sacrifices;
the simple domestic ({%gṛhya%}) rites could normally be performed
without his help, but not the more important rites ({%śrauta%}).
[Page2-089+ 66]
The number varied: the ritual literature requires sixteen priests
to be employed at the greatest sacrifices (see {@Ṛtvij@}), but other
rites could be accomplished with four,<sup>106</sup> five,<sup>107</sup> six,<sup>108</sup> seven,<sup>109</sup>
or ten<sup>110</sup> priests. Again, the Kauṣītakins<sup>111</sup> had a seventeenth
priest beside the usual sixteen, the Sadasya, so called because
he watched the performance from the Sadas, ‘seat.’ In one
rite, the Sattra (‘sacrificial session’) of the serpents, the
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>112</sup> adds three more to the sixteen, a
second Unnetṛ, an Abhigara, and an Apagara. The later ritual
places the Brahman at the head of all the priests, but this is
probably not the early view (see {@Brahman@}).
<div n="P"/>The sacrifice ensured, if properly performed, primarily the
advantages of the sacrificer ({%yajamāna%}),<sup>113</sup> but the priest shared
in the profit, besides securing the {@Dakṣiṇās.@} Disputes between
sacrificers and the priests were not rare, as in the case of
{@Viśvantara@} and the {@Śyāparṇas,@}<sup>114</sup> or {@Janamejaya@} and the
{@Asitamṛgas;@}<sup>115</sup> and the {@Aiṣāvīras@} are referred to as undesirable
priests.<sup>116</sup> Moreover, {@Viśvāmitra@} once held the post of Puro-
hita to {@Sudās,@} but gave place to {@Vasiṣṭha.@}
[Page2-090+ 53]
<div n="P"/>The position of {@Purohita@} differed considerably from that of
the ordinary priest, for the Purohita not merely might officiate
at the sacrifice, but was the officiator in all the private sacrifices
of his king. Hence he could, and undoubtedly sometimes did,
obtain great influence over his master in matters of secular
importance; and the power of the priesthood in political as
opposed to domestic and religious matters, no doubt rested on
the Purohita.
<div n="P"/>There is no recognition in Vedic literature of the rule later
prevailing by which, after spending part of his life as a Brahma-
cārin, and part as a householder, the Brahmin became an
ascetic<sup>117</sup> (later divided into the two stages of Vānaprastha,
‘forest-dweller,’ and Saṃnyāsin, ‘mystic’). Yājñavalkya's
case<sup>118</sup> shows that study of the Absolute might empty life of all
its content for the sage, and drive him to abandon wife and
family. In Buddhist times the same phenomenon is seen<sup>119</sup>
applying to other than Brahmins. The Buddhist texts are
here confirmed in some degree by the Greek authorities.<sup>120</sup>
The practice bears a certain resemblance to the habit of kings,
in the Epic tradition,<sup>121</sup> of retiring to the forest when active life
is over.
<div n="P"/>From the Greek authorities<sup>122</sup> it also appears — what is
certainly the case in the Buddhist literature<sup>123</sup> — that Brahmins
practised the most diverse occupations. It is difficult to say
how far this was true for the Vedic period. The analogy of the
Druids<sup>124</sup> — in some respects very close — suggests that the
Brahmins may have been mainly confined to their professional
tasks, including all the learned professions such as astronomy<sup>125</sup>
[Page2-091+ 54]
and so forth. This is not contradicted by any Vedic evidence,
for instance, the poet of a hymn of the Rigveda<sup>126</sup> says he is a
poet, his father a physician ({@Bhiṣaj@}), and his mother a grinder
of corn ({@Upala-prakṣiṇī@}). This would seem to show that a
Brahmin could be a doctor, while his wife would perform the
ordinary household duties. So a Purohita could perhaps take
the field to assist the king by prayer, as Viśvāmitra,<sup>127</sup> and
later on Vasiṣṭha<sup>128</sup> do, but this does not show that priests
normally fought. Nor do they seem normally to have been
agriculturists or merchants. On the other hand, they kept
cattle: a Brahmacārin's duty was to watch his master's
cattle.<sup>129</sup> It is therefore needless to suppose that they could
not, and did not, on occasion turn to agricultural or mercan-
tile pursuits, as they certainly did later. But it must be
remembered that in all probability there was more purity of
blood, and less pressure of life, among the Brahmins of the
Vedic age than later in Buddhist times, when the Vedic
sacrificial apparatus was falling into grave disrepute.
<div n="P"/>It is clear that the Brahmins, whatever their defects, repre-
sented the intellectual side of Vedic life, and that the Kṣatriyas,
if they played a part in that life, did so only in a secondary
degree, and to a minor extent. It is natural to suppose that
the Brahmins also composed ballads, the precursors of the
epic; for though none such have survived, a few stanzas of this
character, celebrating the generosity of patrons, have been
preserved by being embedded in priestly compositions. A
legend in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>130</sup> shows clearly that the
Brahmins regarded civilization as being spread by them only:
[Page2-092+ 48]
{@Kosala@} and {@Videha,@} no doubt settled by Āryan tribes, are only
rendered civilized and habitable by the influence of pious
Brahmins. We need not doubt that the non-Brahminical
tribes (see {@Vrātya@}) had attained intellectual as well as material
civilization, but it is reasonable to assume that their civilization
was inferior to that of the Brahmins, for the history of
Hinduism is the conquest by the Brahmins — not by arms, but
by mind — of the tribes Āryan and non-Āryan originally beyond
the pale.
