1. {@Su-parṇa,@}¦ ‘well-winged,’ designates a large bird of prey,
the ‘eagle’ or the ‘vulture,’ in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later.<sup>2</sup> In
the passages in which it appears as an eater of carrion<sup>3</sup> it must
be the vulture. The Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> mentions an eagle
which separates milk from water like the {@Kruñc.@} In the
Rigveda<sup>5</sup> the Suparṇa is said to be the child of the {@Śyena,@} and
is distinguished from the latter in another passage:<sup>6</sup> this led
Zimmer<sup>7</sup> to think that the falcon is probably meant.<sup>8</sup> The
Atharvaveda alludes to its cry,<sup>9</sup> and describes it as living in
the hills.<sup>10</sup>
