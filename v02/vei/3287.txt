{@Śiva@}¦ as the name of a people occurs once in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup>
where they share with the {@Alinas, Pakthas, Bhalānases,@} and
{@Viṣāṇins@} the honour of being defeated by {@Sudās,@} not of being,
as Roth<sup>2</sup> thought, his allies. There can hardly be any doubt
[Page2-382+ 39]
of their identity with the <lang n="greek">Σίβαι</lang><sup>3</sup> or <lang n="greek">Σίβοι</lang><sup>4</sup> of the Greeks, who
dwelt between the Indus and the Akesines ({@Asiknī@}) in Alexander's
time. The village of Śiva-pura, mentioned by the scholiast on
Pāṇini<sup>5</sup> as situated in the northern country, may also preserve
the name. {%Cf.%} {@Śibi.@}
