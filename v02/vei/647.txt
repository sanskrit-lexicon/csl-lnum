{@Kuruṅga@}¦ is mentioned in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as a prince and a
patron. Ludwig<sup>2</sup> suggests that he was a king of the {@Anus,@}
but for this theory there seems no good ground. As the
{@Turvaśas@} are mentioned in the same verse, he may possibly
have been one of their kings. The name suggests a connexion
with the {@Kurus,@} and it may be noted that in the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> the Turvaśas are connected with the {@Pañcālas@}
{@(Krivis).@}
