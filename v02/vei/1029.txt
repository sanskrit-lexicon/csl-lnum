{@Jartila,@}¦ ‘wild sesamum,’ is mentioned in the Taittirīya
Saṃhitā (v. 4, 3, 2) as an unsuitable sacrificial offering. In
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (ix. 1, 1, 3) sesamum seeds are
regarded as combining the qualities of cultivation (viz.,
edibility) with those of wild growth (because they are produced
on unploughed land).
