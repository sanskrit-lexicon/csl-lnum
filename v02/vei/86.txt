{@Apāna.@}¦ — The word appears repeatedly in the Atharvaveda,<sup>1</sup>
and later as one of the vital breaths ({@Prāṇa@}), usually with
Prāṇa, and often with one or more of the other three. Its
original sense<sup>2</sup> appears to have been ‘inspiration.’ Its con-
nection with the lower part of the body ({%nābhi,%} ‘navel’), which
is found already in the Aitareya Upaniṣad,<sup>3</sup> is not unnatural.
