{@Pesitṛ@}¦ is the name of one of the victims at the Puruṣamedha
(‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda.<sup>1</sup> The sense is quite
[Page2-023+ 50]
uncertain. The word is rendered by the St. Petersburg
Dictionary and by Weber<sup>2</sup> as ‘one who cuts in pieces,’ a
‘carver,’ but Sāyaṇa<sup>3</sup> thinks that it means one who causes an
enmity which has been lulled to rest to break out again.
