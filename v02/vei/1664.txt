{@Pati, Patnī.@}¦ — Under these words denoting primarily, as the
evidence collected in the St. Petersburg Dictionary shows,
‘lord’ and ‘lady,’ and so ‘husband’ and ‘wife,’ it is convenient
to consider the marital relations of the Vedic community.
<div n="P"/>{%Child Marriage.%} — Marriage in the early Vedic texts appears
essentially as a union of two persons of full development. This
is shown by the numerous references<sup>1</sup> to unmarried girls who
grow old in the house of their fathers ({%amā-jur%}), and who adorn
themselves in desire of marriage, as well as to the paraphernalia
of spells and potions used in the Atharvavedic tradition<sup>2</sup> to
compel the love of man or woman respectively, while even the
Rigveda<sup>3</sup> itself seems to present us with a spell by which a
[Page1-475+ 60]
lover seeks to send all the household to sleep when he visits his
beloved. Child wives first occur regularly in the Sūtra period,
though it is still uncertain to what extent the rule of marriage
before puberty there obtained.<sup>4</sup> The marriage ritual also quite
clearly presumes that the marriage is a real and not a nominal
one: an essential feature is the taking of the bride to her
husband's home, and the ensuing cohabitation.<sup>5</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%Limitations on Marriage.%} — It is difficult to say with certainty
within what limits marriage was allowed. The dialogue of
Yama and Yamī in the Rigveda<sup>6</sup> seems clearly to point to a
prohibition of the marriage of brother and sister. It can
hardly be said, as Weber<sup>7</sup> thinks, to point to a practice that
was once in use and later became antiquated. In the Gobhila
Gṛhya Sūtra<sup>8</sup> and the Dharma Sūtras<sup>9</sup> are found prohibitions
against marriage in the {@Gotra@} (‘family’) or within six degrees
on the mother's or father's side, but in the Śatapatha Brāh-
maṇa<sup>10</sup> marriage is allowed in the third or fourth generation,
the former being allowed, according to Harisvamin,<sup>11</sup> by the
Kāṇvas, and the second by the Saurāṣṭras, while the Dākṣi-
ṇātyas allowed marriage with the daughter of the mother's
brother or the son of the father's sister, but presumably not
with the daughter of the mother's sister or the son of the
father's brother. The prohibition of marriage within the
Gotra cannot then have existed,<sup>12</sup> though naturally marriages
[Page1-476+ 64]
outside the Gotra were frequent.<sup>13</sup> Similarity of caste was also
not an essential to marriage, as hypergamy was permitted even
by the Dharma Sūtras,<sup>14</sup> so that a Brāhmaṇa could marry
wives of any lower caste, a Kṣatriya wives of the two lowest
castes as well as of his own caste, a Vaiśya a Śūdrā as well as
a Vaiśyā, although the Śūdrā marriages were later disapproved
{%in toto.%} Instances of such intermarriage are common in the
Epic, and are viewed as normal in the Bṛhaddevatā.<sup>15</sup>
<div n="P"/>It was considered proper that the younger brothers and
sisters should not anticipate their elders by marrying before
them. The later Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas<sup>16</sup> present a series
of names expressive of such anticipation, censuring as sinful
those who bear them. These terms are the {%pari-vividāna,%}<sup>17</sup> or
perhaps {%agre-dadhus,%}<sup>18</sup> the man who, though a younger brother,
marries before his elder brother, the latter being then called the
{%parivitta;%}<sup>19</sup> the {%agre-didhiṣu,%}<sup>20</sup> the man who weds a younger
daughter while her elder sister is still unmarried; and the
{@Didhiṣū-pati,@}<sup>21</sup> who is the husband of the latter. The passages
do not explicitly say that the exact order of birth must always
be followed, but the mention of the terms shows that the order
was often broken.
<div n="P"/>{%Widow Remarriage.%} — The remarriage of a widow was
[Page1-477+ 62]
apparently permitted. This seems originally to have taken the
form of the marriage of the widow to the brother or other
nearest kinsman of the dead man in order to produce children.
At any rate, the ceremony is apparently alluded to in a funeral
hymn of the Rigveda;<sup>22</sup> for the alternative explanation, which
sees in the verse a reference to the ritual of the Puruṣamendha
(‘human sacrifice’), although accepted by Hillebrandt<sup>23</sup> and
Delbrück,<sup>24</sup> is not at all probable, while the ordinary view is
supported by the Sūtra evidence.<sup>25</sup> Moreover, another passage
of the Rigveda<sup>26</sup> clearly refers to the marriage of the widow
and the husband's brother ({%devṛ%}), which constitutes what the
Indians later knew as Niyoga.<sup>27</sup> This custom was probably
not followed except in cases where no son was already born.
This custom was hardly remarriage in the strict sense, since
the brother might — so far as appears — be already married
himself. In the Atharvaveda,<sup>28</sup> a verse refers to a charm which
would secure the reunion, in the next world, of a wife and her
second husband. Though, as Delbrück<sup>29</sup> thinks, this very
possibly refers to a case in which the first husband was still
alive,<sup>30</sup> but was impotent or had lost caste ({%patita%}),<sup>31</sup> still it is
certain that the later Dharma Sūtras<sup>32</sup> began to recognize
ordinary remarriage in case of the death of the first husband.
[Page1-478+ 67]
Pischel<sup>33</sup> finds some evidence in the Rigveda<sup>34</sup> to the effect
that a woman could remarry if her husband disappeared and
could not be found or heard of.
<div n="P"/>{%Polygamy.%} — A Vedic Indian could have more than one wife.
This is proved clearly by many passages in the Rigveda;<sup>35</sup>
Manu, according to the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā,<sup>36</sup> had ten wives;
and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>37</sup> explains polygamy by a
characteristic legend. Moreover, the king regularly has four
wives attributed to him, the Mahiṣī,<sup>38</sup> the Parivṛktī,<sup>39</sup> the
Vāvātā,<sup>40</sup> and the Pālāgalī.<sup>41</sup> The Mahiṣī appears to be the
chief wife, being the first one married according to the Śata-
patha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>42</sup> The Parivṛktī, ‘the neglected,’ is explained
by Weber<sup>43</sup> and Pischel<sup>44</sup> as one that has had no son. The
Vāvātā is ‘the favourite,’ while the Pālāgalī is, according to
Weber, the daughter of the last of the court officials. The
names are curious, and not very intelligible, but the evidence
points to the wife first wedded alone being a wife in the fullest
sense. This view is supported by the fact emphasized by
[Page1-479+ 63]
Delbrück,<sup>45</sup> that in the sacrifice the Patnī is usually mentioned
in the singular, apparent exceptions being due to some mytho-
logical reason.<sup>46</sup> Zimmer<sup>47</sup> is of opinion that polygamy is
dying out in the Rigvedic period, monogamy being developed
from polygamy; Weber,<sup>48</sup> however, thinks that polygamy is
secondary, a view that is supported by more recent anthro-
pology.<sup>49</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%Polyandry.%} — On the other hand, polyandry is not Vedic.<sup>50</sup>
There is no passage containing any clear reference to such
a custom. The most that can be said is that in the Rigveda<sup>51</sup>
and the Atharvaveda<sup>52</sup> verses are occasionally found in which
husbands are mentioned in relation to a single wife. It is
difficult to be certain of the correct explanation of each separate
instance of this mode of expression; but even if Weber's<sup>53</sup>
view, that the plural is here used {%majestatis causā,%} is not
accepted, Delbrück's<sup>54</sup> explanation by mythology is probably
right. In other passages<sup>55</sup> the plural is simply generic.
<div n="P"/>{%Marital Relations.%} — Despite polygamy, however, there is
ample evidence that the marriage tie was not, as Weber<sup>56</sup> has
suggested, lightly regarded as far as the fidelity of the wife
was concerned. There is, however, little trace of the husband's
being expected to be faithful as a matter of morality. Several
[Page1-480+ 57]
passages,<sup>57</sup> indeed, forbid, with reference to ritual abstinence,
intercourse with the {%strī%} of another. This may imply that
adultery on the husband's part was otherwise regarded as
venial. But as the word {%strī%} includes all the ‘womenfolk,’
daughters and slaves, as well as wife, the conclusion can hardly
be drawn that intercourse with another man's ‘wife’ was
normally regarded with indifference.<sup>58</sup> The curious ritual of
the Varuṇapraghāsās,<sup>59</sup> in which the wife of the sacrificer is
questioned as to her lovers, is shown by Delbrück<sup>60</sup> to be a
part of a rite meant to expiate unchastity on the part of a wife,
not as a normal question for a sacrificer to put to his own wife.
Again, Yājñavalkya's doctrine in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>61</sup>
which seems to assert that no one cares if a wife is unchaste
({%paraḥ-puṃsā%}) or not, really means that no one cares if the wife
is away from the men who are sacrificing, as the wives of
the gods are apart from them during the particular rite in
question. Monogamy is also evidently approved,<sup>62</sup> so that
some higher idea of morality was in course of formation. On
the other hand, no Vedic text gives us the rule well known to
other Indo-Germanic<sup>63</sup> peoples that the adulterer taken in the
act can be killed with impunity, though the later legal literature
has traces of this rule.<sup>64</sup> There is also abundant evidence that
the standard of ordinary sexual morality was not high.
<div n="P"/>{%Hetairai.%} — In the Rigveda<sup>65</sup> there are many references to
illegitimate love and to the abandonment of the offspring of
[Page1-481+ 59]
such unions,<sup>66</sup> especially in the case of a protégé of Indra,
often mentioned as the {%parāvṛkta%} or {%parāvṛj.%}<sup>67</sup> The ‘son of
a maiden’ ({%kumārī-putra%}) is already spoken of in the Vājasaneyi
Saṃhitā.<sup>68</sup> Such a person appears with a metronymic in the
Upaniṣad period:<sup>69</sup> this custom may be the origin of metro-
nymics such as those which make up a great part of the lists
of teachers (Vaṃśas) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad.<sup>70</sup> The
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>71</sup> refers to illicit unions of Śūdra and Ārya,
both male and female, besides giving in its list of victims at
the Puruṣamedha, or ‘human sacrifice,’ several whose desig-
nations apparently mean ‘courtesan’ ({%atītvarī%})<sup>72</sup> and ‘procuress
of abortion’ ({%atiṣkadvarī%}),<sup>73</sup> while the ‘dyeing woman’ ({%rajayitrī%})
is dedicated to sensuality.<sup>74</sup> Pischel and Geldner also see
many references to Hetairai in other passages of the Rigveda,<sup>75</sup>
especially where mention is made of Uṣas, the goddess of
Dawn, who in their view is the characteristic Hetaira. At any
rate, there is little doubt that the ‘dancer’ ({%nṛtū%}) referred to in
one passage of the Rigveda<sup>76</sup> was a Hetaira. When women
are referred to as going to the {@Samana,@} or ‘place of meeting,’
Hetairai are probably also meant.<sup>77</sup> Grave cases of immorality
are alluded to in the Rigveda.<sup>78</sup> The love of father and
daughter, as shown in the myth of Prajāpati,<sup>79</sup> is evidently
censured, but the actual existence of this form of incest is
recognized in the Atharvaveda.<sup>80</sup> Girls who had lost their
[Page1-482+ 76]
natural protectors — father or brother<sup>81</sup> — were apt to be reduced
to live by immorality.
<div n="P"/>{%Forms of Marriage.%} — The state of society revealed in the
Vedic age seems to point to considerable freedom on the part
of both man and woman in selecting a wife or a husband.
At any rate, it is not clear that either the father or the mother
controlled the marriage of son or daughter of mature age,<sup>82</sup>
though no doubt the parents or parent often arranged a suit-
able match.<sup>83</sup> The marriage was frequently arranged through
an intermediary, the ‘wooer’ ({%vara%}),<sup>84</sup> presumably after those
concerned had in effect come to an agreement. The sale of
a daughter was not unknown,<sup>85</sup> but a certain amount of dis-
credit would seem to have attached to it,<sup>86</sup> and sons-in-law in
such cases were sometimes stingy. On the other hand, dowries
were not infrequently given, especially no doubt when damsels
Suffered from bodily defects.<sup>87</sup> Occasionally marriages by
[Page1-483+ 56]
capture may have taken place, but only as knightly feats, as
when {@Vimada@} carried off {@Purumitra's@} daughter against her
father's wish, but very possibly with her own consent.<sup>88</sup> The
later law-books and the Epic describe in much detail various
forms of marriage, but they all seem reducible to three types:
({%a%}) that which is based on mutual consent, the {%prājāpatya%}
(‘connected with Prajāpati’); ({%b%}) that in which a price is paid
for the bride, the {%āsura%} (‘Asura-like’), {%ārṣa%} (‘connected with
the Ṛṣis’), {%brāhma%} (‘relating to Brahman’), or {%daiva%} (‘divine’);
({%c%}) those which consist in stealing the bride, the {%kṣātra%}
(‘warrior-like’) or the {%rākṣasa%} (‘demon-like’) mode, of all of
which traces are found in Vedic literature.<sup>89</sup> For instance,
the gift of a maiden for services rendered or other object is
exemplified in the story of {@Cyavana@} in the Jaiminīya Brāh-
maṇa,<sup>90</sup> and in that of {@Śyāvāśva@} in the Bṛhaddevatā.<sup>91</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%Wedding Ceremony.%} — In normal marriages the bridal was
celebrated by an elaborate ceremony which bears in essentials
and details the strongest resemblance to the form observed by
other Indo-Germanic as well as non-Indo-Germanic peoples,<sup>92</sup>
and which was destined to secure the stability and fruitfulness
of the union. The ceremony commenced at the bride's house,<sup>93</sup>
to which the bridegroom with his friends and relations repaired,
and in which he met the friends and relations of the bride.<sup>94</sup>
A cow or cows were slain for the entertainment of the guests.<sup>95</sup>
The bridegroom having caused the bride to mount a stone,
formally grasped her hand, and led her round the household
[Page1-484+ 64]
fire.<sup>96</sup> This act constituted the marriage, the husband hence
being called ‘he who takes by the hand’ ({%hasta-grābha%}).<sup>97</sup> The
festivities being over,<sup>98</sup> the bridegroom took the bride to his
home on a car in a marriage procession,<sup>99</sup> all to the accom-
paniment of suitable stanzas. Then followed cohabitation.<sup>100</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%Wife's Property and Status.%} — We have very little information
as to the legal relations of wife and husband after marriage.
It may be assumed that the husband appropriated the wife's
dowry, if any, as well as her earnings, if any: even in the
Epic<sup>101</sup> the rise of the recognition of women's property as
their own ({%strī-dhana%}) is only slow. That the husband was
absolute master of a wife as of a slave is not probable, though
he doubtless exercised the same power of correction as was
expressly allowed in the eighteenth century by English law.
The poetical ideal<sup>102</sup> of the family was decidedly high, and we
have no reason to doubt that it was often actually fulfilled.
Moreover, the wife on her marriage was at once given an
honoured position in the house; she is emphatically mistress
in her husband's home, exercising authority over her father-
in-law, her husband's brothers, and her unmarried sisters.<sup>103</sup>
No doubt the case contemplated is one in which the eldest son
[Page1-485+ 59]
of a family has become its head owing to the decrepitude<sup>104</sup> of
the parents, his wife then taking the place of the mistress
of the joint family while the brothers and sisters are still
unmarried. It is not inconsistent with the great stress else-
where<sup>105</sup> laid on the respect due to a father-in-law, who then
is probably regarded as still in full possession of his faculties,
and controls the house while his son continues to live with
him. The respect would no doubt equally apply if the son
had set up a separate family of his own.<sup>106</sup>
<div n="P"/>Moreover, the wife was a regular participator in the offerings
of the husband. In this connexion the term {@Patnī@} regularly
applies to her in the Brāhmaṇas,<sup>107</sup> where {@Jāyā@} designates her
in her conjugal capacity, not in that of sharer in the sacrifice.
In this respect her position gradually deteriorated: thus the
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>108</sup> describes a certain ceremony in which
the wife ({%jāyā%}) alone offered the oblation in former times, while
later a priest might do so instead. The same Brāhmaṇa
shows other traces of a lowering in the position of women,
probably due to the growing sense of the importance of cere-
monial priority.<sup>109</sup> So in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>110</sup> women
generally are classed with dice and drink as three chief evils,
and woman is declared to be ‘untruth,’<sup>111</sup> and connected with
Nirṛti, ‘calamity.’<sup>112</sup> A woman too, according to the Taittirīya
Saṃhitā,<sup>113</sup> is inferior even to a bad man, and a sarcastic
reference is made in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>114</sup> to her power of
[Page1-486+ 58]
getting things from her husband by cajolery at night. On the
other hand must be set the encomia on woman: a woman is
half her husband,<sup>115</sup> and completes him;<sup>116</sup> and in the Rigveda<sup>117</sup>
attacks on women mingle with the general assumption of their
good qualities. None the less, the Brāhmaṇas clearly indicate
a gradual decline in their position, which is evident from the
rule that requires the wife to eat after her husband.<sup>118</sup> Scolds
were also known: the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>119</sup> praises the wife
‘who does not answer back’ ({%aprativādinī%}). Women bore no
part in political life: men go to the assembly, not women, the
Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>120</sup> expressly says. On the other hand,
with the advance of education, women shared in the intel-
lectual interests of the day, as is exemplified by Yājñavalkya's<sup>121</sup>
two wives, of whom one was interested in his philosophical
discussions, the other not. Other women are also referred to
in the Upaniṣads as teachers, but whether they were married
is not certain.<sup>122</sup>
<div n="P"/>But the main object of a woman's marriage was the pro-
duction of children, this being repeatedly asserted in the
Rigveda and later.<sup>123</sup> The desire for offspring, as was natural
in a society which mainly counted relationship through the
father, took the form of a wish for a son to perform the
necessary funeral rites for the father, and to continue his line.
It was no doubt possible to adopt a son, but in the Rigveda<sup>124</sup>
this custom is plainly viewed as unsatisfactory. The practice
[Page1-487+ 67]
is recognized,<sup>125</sup> as we have seen above of Niyoga, in the
appointment of a brother to beget children with the wife of
a dead man, or perhaps of a man who is childless. ‘Sonless-
ness’ ({%avīratā%}) is placed on the same level as lack of property
({%amati%}), and Agni is besought to protect from it.<sup>126</sup> The birth
of a daughter was certainly not specially welcome: the Athar-
vaveda<sup>127</sup> in one hymn distinctly invokes the birth of a son,
and deprecates that of a daughter, while the Aitareya Brāh-
maṇa<sup>128</sup> contains an old verse which says that a daughter is
a misery ({%kṛpaṇam%}), while a son is a light in the highest heaven
({%jyotir ha putraḥ parame vyoman%}). But there is no proof that
the Vedic Indians practised the exposure of female children.
This conclusion, deduced from certain passages in the later
Saṃhitās<sup>129</sup> by Zimmer<sup>130</sup> and Delbrück,<sup>131</sup> has been disproved
by Böhtlingk.
<div n="P"/>{%Child Life.%} — No doubt the care of a child was left to
the mother, but we learn little from the earlier litera-
ture<sup>132</sup> of the life of the young. The length of the period
of pregnancy is frequently placed at ten (doubtless lunar)
months.<sup>133</sup> On birth the child was first fed with milk or ghee,
and then given the breast.<sup>134</sup> On the eighth day after birth
[Page1-488+ 78]
the infant was washed.<sup>135</sup> The cutting of the teeth was also
a solemn occasion,<sup>136</sup> and is the subject of a hymn in the
Atharvaveda. Reference is also made to children's learning
to speak, which the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>137</sup> ascribes to the end
of the first year of life. The Aitareya Āraṇyaka<sup>138</sup> asserts that
the words {@Tata@} and {@Tāta,@} onomatopoetic words like ‘dada,’<sup>139</sup>
are the first words of a child's speech, giving therein perhaps
an unfair prominence to the father. The Atharvaveda<sup>140</sup>
further contains at least one hymn for the ceremony of the
first shaving of the young man's beard. The giving of a name
was also an occasion of importance, a second one being often
added.<sup>141</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%Satī.%} — On the death of her husband, in some cases the
widow burned herself or was burned by his relations.<sup>142</sup> This
is clearly implied in the reference to this ancient custom in
the Atharvaveda.<sup>143</sup> On the other hand, the Rigveda does not
contemplate the custom anywhere, but on the contrary con-
siders the widow as married apparently to the brother of the
dead man.<sup>144</sup> The custom of Suttee would therefore appear
during the Vedic age to have been in abeyance, at least as
a general rule. At all times the practice seems to have been
mainly usual among families of the warrior class, to judge
from the other Indo-Germanic parallels.<sup>145</sup> In other classes
[Page1-489+ 31]
the survival of wives was more necessary, and the remarriage of
widows, whether prohibited or allowed in the texts, is proof
that there were widows who could be remarried.<sup>146</sup>
<F>1) {%Cf.%} Rv. i. 117, 7; ii. 17, 7; x. 39,
3; 40, 5. {@Ghoṣā@} is the chief example
of this condition. The Atharvaveda
(i. 14) also refers to such a case (see
Bloomfield, {%Hymns of the Atharvaveda,%}

cially at seasons of festival, are referred

jealousy and love philtres for the pur-
pose of recalling wandering affections

Indra and Agni as more generous than
a {%vijāmātṛ,%} ‘son-in-law,’ or a {%syāla,%}

the former word must be unfavourable,
and the sense, as indicated by Pischel,
is no doubt, that a son-in-law who was
not in other respects altogether suitable
might have to buy his bride at a heavy
cost. The {%vijāmātṛ%} is, in fact, the
{%aśrīro jāmātā,%} the ‘ignoble son-in-law,’

universality of the custom must not be
exaggerated, as Zimmer, 331, is inclined
to do. To burn all the wives of a king
would, in primitive ages, have been a
wasteful action; even the chief wife
would often have had to be spared on
one ground or another. The Rigveda
already reveals a state of society in
which the actual burning of the wife
was avoided by a semblance of it in
the funeral ritual of ({%cf.%} Macdonell,
{%Sanskrit Literature,%} 126). The reward
of a good wife was to go to the world
of her husband ({%pati-loka%}) after death
({%cf.%} Av. xiv. 1, 64; xviii. 3, 1; Rv.
x. 85, 43). A Vedic citation in the

says that a Brahmin woman who drinks

go to the world of her husband after
death.</F>
