{@Nāhuṣa,@}¦ like {@Nahus,@} means, according to the St. Petersburg
Dictionary, in some passages of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> ‘neighbouring’
as an adjective, and once<sup>2</sup> as a substantive ‘neighbour.’ If,
on the other hand, Nahus is taken as a proper name, then
Nāhuṣa no doubt denotes ‘belonging to the Nahus people,’
and, as a substantive, ‘King of the Nahus.’
