Rājasūya by {@Vāsiṣṭha Satyahavya,@} and thereupon conquered
the earth. When Vāsiṣṭha reminded him of his indebtedness,

he intended to conquer the {@Uttara Kurus,@} and that Vāsiṣṭha
would then become King of the Earth, Atyarāti himself being
his general ({%senā-pati%}). Vāsiṣṭha replied that as no mortal man
could conquer the Uttara Kurus he was cheated of his reward.

hands of {@Amitratapana Śuṣmiṇa Śaibya.@}<sup>1</sup>
