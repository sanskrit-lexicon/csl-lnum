2. {@Dṛti Aindrota@}¦ (‘descendant of {@Indrota@}’) is mentioned in
the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇā<sup>1</sup> as a contemporary of {@Abhipratārin@}
{@Kākṣaseni@} and as a pupil of {@Indrota Daivāpa@} in a Vaṃśa (list
of teachers) in the Jaīminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa.<sup>2</sup> Possibly
the same Dṛti is meant in the compound Dṛti-Vātavantau,
which is found in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.<sup>3</sup> The former is
here said to have continued, after the Mahāvrata was over, the
sacrificial session in which both had been engaged, with the
result that his descendants prospered more than the Vātavatas.
