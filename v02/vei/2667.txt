{@Rājanya@}¦ is the regular term in Vedic literature<sup>1</sup> for a man of
the royal family, probably including also those who were not
actually members of that family, but were nobles, though it
may have been originally restricted to members of the royal
family. This, however, does not appear clearly from any
passage; the term may originally have applied to all the nobles
irrespective of kingly power. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup>
the Rājanya is different from the Rājaputra, who is literally a
son of the king. The functions and place of the Rājanya are
described under {@Kṣatriya,@} which expression later normally
takes the place of Rājanya as a designation for the ruling class.
His high place is shown by the fact that in the Taittirīya
Saṃhitā<sup>3</sup> he is ranked with the learned Brahmin and the

{@Grāmaṇī@} (who was a {@Vaiśya@}) as having reached the height of
prosperity ({%gata-śrī%}).

Puruṣa-sūkta, x. 90, 12; but often in
the Av.: v. 17, 9; 18, 2; vi. 38, 4;
x. 10, 18; xii. 4, 32 {%et seq.;%} xv. 8, 1;
xix. 32, 8; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 4,
13, 1; 5, 4, 4; 10, 1; v. 1, 10, 3, etc.
Even in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
where, on the whole, the later use of
Kṣatriya prevails, the Rājanya is often
mentioned. See Eggeling's index, {%Sacred%}

families not related to the royal family
were families of minor princes whose
rule was merged in that of the king
on the formation of a powerful tribe,
as was the case in Germany.</F>
