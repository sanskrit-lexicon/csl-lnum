{@Hṛd-yota@}¦<sup>1</sup> (for {@Hṛd-dyota@}) and {@Hṛd-roga,@}<sup>2</sup> ‘heart disease,’
are mentioned in the Atharvaveda and the Rigveda respec-
tively. Zimmer<sup>3</sup> identifies the disease in the Atharvaveda with
{@Hṛdayāmaya,@} ‘consumption caused by love.’ In the Rigveda
this is not at all likely: later in the medical Saṃhitās the word
probably denotes {%angina pectoris.%}<sup>4</sup>
