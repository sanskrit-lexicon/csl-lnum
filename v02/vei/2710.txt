{@Ruṣatī@}¦ in one passage of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> denotes, according to
Ludwig,<sup>2</sup> a maiden who was married to {@Śyāva.@} On the other
hand, Roth<sup>3</sup> treats the word as {%ruśatī,%} ‘white,’ and {%ruśatīm%}
seems clearly to be the reading of the text. It is doubtful what
the meaning is, and whether Śyāva is a proper name at all.<sup>4</sup>
