{@Citra-ratha@}¦ (‘having a brilliant car’) is the name of two
persons.
<div n="P"/>({%a%}) It designates an Āryan prince, who, with Arṇa, was
defeated by Indra for the Turvaśa-Yadus on the {@Sarayu@} (per-
haps the modern Sarju in Oudh), according to the Rigveda (iv.
30, 18). The locality would accord with the close connexion
of Turvaśa and {@Krivi@} or {@Pañcāla.@}
[Page1-262+ 46]
<div n="P"/>({%b%}) Citraratha is also the name of a king for whom the
{@Kāpeyas@} performed a special kind of sacrifice ({%dvirātra%}), with
the result, according to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>1</sup> that in the
Caitrarathi family only one member was a Kṣatra-pati, the rest
dependents. Apparently this must mean that the Caitrarathis
were distinguished from other families of princes by the fact
that the chief of the clan received a markedly higher position
than in most cases, in which probably the heads of the family
were rather an oligarchy than a monarch and his dependents.
