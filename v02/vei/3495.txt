{@Sam-iti@}¦ denotes an ‘assembly’ of the Vedic tribe. It is
already mentioned in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> and often later,<sup>2</sup> sometimes
in connexion with {@Sabhā.@}<sup>3</sup> Ludwig<sup>4</sup> considers that the Samiti
included all the people, primarily the {%viśaḥ,%} ‘subjects,’ but also
the {@Maghavans@} and Brahmins if they desired, though the
Sabhā was their special assembly. This view is not probable,
nor is that of Zimmer,<sup>5</sup> that the Sabhā was the village assembly.
Hillebrandt appears to be right in holding that Samiti and
Sabhā are much the same, the one being the assembly, the
other primarily the place of assembly.<sup>6</sup>
[Page2-431+ 63]
<div n="P"/>The king went to the assembly<sup>7</sup> just as he went to the
Sabhā. That he was elected there, as Zimmer<sup>8</sup> thinks, is as
uncertain as whether he was elected at all (see {@Rājan@}). But
there are clear signs that concord between king and assembly
were essential for his prosperity.<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is reasonable to assume that the business of the assembly
was general deliberation on policy of all kinds, legislation so
far as the Vedic Indian cared to legislate, and judicial work ({%cf.%}
{@Sabhāsad@}). But of all these occupations there is, perhaps as a
result of the nature of the texts, little or no evidence directly
available.
<div n="P"/>The gods had a Samiti, hence called {%daivī,%} ‘divine,’<sup>10</sup> just as
they had a Sabhā.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>The assembly disappears as an effective part of government
in the Buddhist texts,<sup>12</sup> the Epic,<sup>13</sup> and the law-books.<sup>14</sup>

the decay of the old assembly through
the aristocratic war council and the
secret priestly conclave. It is, of course,
very probable that at no time was the
Samiti a place where any or much
attention was paid to the views of the
common man. Princes and great men
spoke; the rest approved or disap-
proved, as in Homeric times and in
Germany ({%cf.%} Lang, {%Anthropology and%}
