{@Vraja@}¦ denotes in the first instance, in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> the place
to which the cattle resort (from {%vraj,%} ‘go’), the ‘feeding ground’
to which the milk-giving animals go out<sup>2</sup> in the morning from
the village ({@Grāma@}), while the others stay in it all day and
night.<sup>3</sup> Secondarily it denotes the ‘herd’<sup>4</sup> itself. This is
Geldner's view,<sup>5</sup> which seems clearly better than that of Roth<sup>6</sup>
who regards Vraja as primarily the ‘enclosure’ (from {%vṛj%}), and
only thence the ‘herd’; for the Vraja does not normally mean
an ‘enclosure’ at all: the Vedic cattle were not stall-fed as a
general rule. In some passages, however, ‘pen,’<sup>7</sup> in others
‘stall,’<sup>8</sup> is certainly meant. The word is often used in the
myth of the robbing of the kine.<sup>9</sup> It occasionally denotes a
‘cistern.’<sup>10</sup>

97, 10; 101, 8. {%Cf.%} Medhātithi on

<F>7) Av. iii. 11, 5; iv. 38, 7; Śāṅkhāyana
Āraṇyaka, ii. 16. Metaohorically, in
the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 4, 22,
Mādhyaṃdina, it is a pen with a bolt
({%sārgala%}) and with a palisade ({%sa-pari-%}
{%śraya%}). The sense of ‘pen’ is also
possible in Rv. x. 97, 10; 101, 8, and
is not radically opposed to it, for Vraja
denotes the place where the cattle are
fed, and can therefore be applied to
the stall where they are during the
night. {%Cf.%} {@Goṣṭha.@}</F>
<F>8) Rv. x. 4, 2, where the ‘warm
Vraja’ to which the cows resort is
alluded to, and iv. 51, 2, where the
Dawns open wide the doors of the
Vraja of darkness; Taittirīya. Brāh-
maṇa, iii. 8, 12, 2, where the Vraja is
said to be made of Aśvattha wood.
The sense of ‘stall’ is probable in
