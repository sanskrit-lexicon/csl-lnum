{@Aja.@}¦ — The Ajas are named in one verse of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as
having been defeated by the {@Tṛtsus@} under {@Sudās.@} They are
there mentioned with the {@Yakṣus@} and {@Śigrus,@} and Zimmer<sup>2</sup>
conjectures that they formed part of a confederacy under
Bheda against Sudās. The name has been regarded as a sign
of totemism,<sup>3</sup> but this is very uncertain, and it is impossible to
say if they were or were not Āryans.
