{@Ṛtu,@}¦ ‘season,’ is a term repeatedly mentioned from the
Rigveda<sup>1</sup> onwards, Three seasons of the year are often
alluded to,<sup>2</sup> but the names are not usually specified. In one
passage of the Rigveda<sup>3</sup> spring ({%vasanta%}), summer ({%grīṣma%}), and
autumn ({%śarad%}) are given. The Rigveda knows also the rainy
season ({%prā-vṛṣ%}) and the winter ({%himā, hemanta%}). A more
usual<sup>4</sup> division (not found in the Rigveda) is into five seasons,
[Page1-111+ 57]
{%vasanta, grīṣma, varṣā, śarad, hemama-siśira,%} but occasionally
the five are otherwise divided, {%varṣā-śarad%} being made one
season.<sup>5</sup> Sometimes six<sup>6</sup> seasons are reckoned, {%hemanta%} and
{%śiśira%} being divided, so that the six seasons can be made
parallel to the twelve months of the year. A still more
artificial arrangement<sup>7</sup> makes the seasons seven, possibly by
reckoning the intercalary month as a season, as Weber and
Zimmer<sup>8</sup> hold, or more probably because of the predilection
for the number seven, as Roth<sup>9</sup> suggests. Occasionally the
word {%ṛtu%} is applied to the months.<sup>10</sup> The last season,
according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>11</sup> is {%hemanta.%}
<div n="P"/>The growth of the division of the seasons from three to five
is rightly explained by Zimmer<sup>12</sup> as indicating the advance of
the Vedic Indians towards the east. It is not Rigvedic, but
dominates the later Saṃhitās. Traces of an earlier division of
the year into winter and summer do not appear clearly in the
Rigveda, where the appropriate words {%himā%} and {%samā%} are
merely general appellations of the year, and where {%śarad%}<sup>13</sup> is
commoner than either as a designation of the year, because it
denotes the harvest, a time of overwhelming importance to a
young agricultural people. The division of the year in one
passage of the Atharvaveda<sup>14</sup> into two periods of six months
is merely formal, and in no way an indication of old
tradition.
