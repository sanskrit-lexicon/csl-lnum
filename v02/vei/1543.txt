{@Nābhā-nediṣṭha@}¦ (‘nearest in descent’) {@Mānava@} (‘descendant
of Manu’) is famous in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas<sup>1</sup>
for the way in which he was treated when his father {@Manu@}
divided his property among his sons, or they divided it:
Nābhānediṣṭha was left out, but was solaced by obtaining,
through his father's advice, cows from the Aṅgirases, a feat
which is regarded in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>2</sup> as on a
level with the exploits of other seers who celebrated their
patrons in hymns, and as giving rise to the hymn, Rigveda x. 62.
Nābhānediṣṭha's hymn is repeatedly mentioned in the Brāh-
maṇas,<sup>3</sup> but beyond its authorship nothing is recorded of him.
In the Saṃhitā<sup>4</sup> itself he seems to be spoken of as a poet in
one passage, which is, however, of quite uncertain meaning.
<div n="P"/>Nābhānediṣṭha is etymologically connected in all probability
with Nabānazdiṣta in the Avesta, which refers to the Fravaṣi
of the paoiryō-ṭkaēsha and the Fravaṣi of the Nabānazdiṣta.
Lassen<sup>5</sup> saw in the legend a reminiscence of an Indo-Iranian
split; but Roth<sup>6</sup> showed conclusively that this was impossible,
and that Nābhānediṣṭha meant simply ‘nearest in birth,’ and
[Page1-443+ 48]
Weber<sup>7</sup> admits that the connexion of the words is not one of
borrowing on either side, but that in the Avesta it has kept its
original sense of ‘nearest relation,’ while in the Rigveda it has
become a proper name.
