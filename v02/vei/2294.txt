2. {@Bheda@}¦ is mentioned in the Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> as having come
to a bad end because he refused a cow ({%vaśā%}) to Indra when
asked for it. That he is different from the preceding Bheda, as
Roth<sup>2</sup> assumes, is not certain. Indeed, it may very well be
that his defeat led to his being chosen as the representative of
the evil end of the wicked man. Moreover, the irreligious
character of Bheda may be ascribed to his being a leader of
non-Āryan folk, if the {@Ajas@} and {@Śigrus,@} with whom in the
Rigveda he is connected or associated were, as is possible,
though by no means certain, un-Āryan tribes of totemists.<sup>3</sup>
