{@Magha@}¦ in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> denotes ‘bounty,’ and Maghavan<sup>2</sup> is
the regular Vedic name for the ‘generous giver’ of bounties to
priests. It is doubtful whether the Maghavans were more than
this, or had any special rank as a class in Vedic society. See

iv. 17, 8; v. 30, 12; 32, 12, etc.;

Magha-tti, ‘giving of gifts,’ Rv. iv. 37,
8; v. 79, 5; viii. 24, 10, etc.; Magha-
deya, ‘giving of gifts,’ vii. 67, 9;
x. 156, 2; Maghavat-tva, ‘liberality,’
vi. 27, 3. The word Maghavan is the
epithet {%par excellence%} of Indra in the
Rv. (iii. 30, 3; iv. 16, 1; 31, 7; 42, 5,
etc.), and survives in post-Vedic litera-
ture as a name of Indra; otherwise,
even in the later Saṃhitās, it is very
rare, occurring practically as a divine
epithet only (of Indra, Taittirīya Saṃ-
hitā, iv. 4, 8, 1; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upani-
ṣad, i. 3, 13; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad,
ii. 11).</F>
