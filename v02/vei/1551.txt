{@Nārāśaṃsī@}¦ (scil. Ṛc), ‘(verse) celebrating men,’ is mentioned
as early as the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> and is distinguished from {@Gāthā@} in
a number of passages in the later literature.<sup>2</sup> The Kāṭhaka
Saṃhitā,<sup>3</sup> while distinguishing the two, asserts that both are
false ({%anṛtam%}). It is hardly probable that the two were abso-
lutely distinct, for the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> has the phrase
‘a Gāthā celebrating men’ ({%nārāśaṃsī%}). What such verses
were may be seen from the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra,<sup>5</sup> which
enumerates the {%Nārāśaṃsāni%} at the Puruṣamedha, or ‘human
[Page1-446+ 63]
sacrifice.’ They may legitimately be reckoned as a source of
the epic.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>The term Nārāśaṃsī is restricted in some passages<sup>7</sup> to a
particular group of three verses of the Atharvaveda,<sup>8</sup> but
Oldenberg<sup>9</sup> must be right in holding that the restricted sense
is not to be read into the Rigveda.<sup>10</sup> Not even in the Taittirīya
Saṃhitā<sup>11</sup> is the technical sense certain, and the Bṛhaddevatā<sup>12</sup>
gives the word a general application.

their character as mere eulogies of
donors, and that, no doubt, was one
of their sides; but the other elements
may have been more prominent in
reality than the priestly tradition
shows.</F>
