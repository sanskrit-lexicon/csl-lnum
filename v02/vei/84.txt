{@Apa-skambha.@}¦ — The word occurs only in one passage of the
Atharvaveda, where the tip of it is mentioned as poisoned.
Roth<sup>1</sup> suggests that the fastening of the arrow-point to the
shaft is meant. Whitney<sup>2</sup> inclines to this version, but suggests
corruption of text. Zimmer<sup>3</sup> follows Roth. Ludwig<sup>4</sup> renders
the word by ‘barb.’ Bloomfield<sup>5</sup> thinks it means ‘tearing
(arrow),’ a sense deduced from the etymology.
