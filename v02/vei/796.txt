{@Kṣatriya.@}¦ — As the origin of caste, the relation of the castes,
intermarriage, and cognate matters may most conveniently be
discussed under {@Varṇa,@} this article will be confined to deter-
mining, as far as possible, the real character of the class called
Kṣatriyas, or collectively {@Kṣatra.@}
<div n="P"/>The evidence of the Jātakas<sup>1</sup> points to the word Khattiya
[Page1-203+ 47]
denoting the members of the old Āryan nobility who had led
the tribes to conquest, {@as well@} as those families of the aborigines
who had managed to maintain their princely status in spite
of the conquest. In the epic<sup>2</sup> also the term Kṣatriya seems to
include these persons, but it has probably a wider signification
than Khattiya, and would cover all the royal military vassals
and feudal chiefs, expressing, in fact, pretty much the same
as the {%barones%} of early English history. Neither in the
Jātakas<sup>3</sup> nor in the epic<sup>4</sup> is the term co-extensive with all
warriors; the army contains many besides the Kṣatriyas, who
are the leaders or officers, rather than the rank and file.
<div n="P"/>In the later Saṃhitās<sup>5</sup> and the Brāhmaṇas<sup>6</sup> the Kṣatriya
stands as a definite member of the social body, distinct from
the priest, the subject people, and the slaves, {@Brāhmaṇa,@}
{@Vaiśya,@} and {@Śūdra.@} It is significant that Rājanya is a variant
to Kṣatriya, and an earlier one. Hence it is reasonable to
suppose that the Kṣatriya and Rājanya are both of similar
origin, being princely or connected with royalty. Moreover,
the early use of Kṣatriya in the Rigveda<sup>7</sup> is exclusively con-
nected with royal authority or divine authority.
<div n="P"/>It is impossible to say exactly what persons would be in-
cluded in the term Kṣatriya. That it covered the royal house
and the various branches of the royal family may be regarded
as certain. It, no doubt, also included the nobles and their
families: this would explain the occasional opposition of
Rājanya and Kṣatriya, as in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>8</sup> where
a Rājanya asks a Kṣatriya for a place for sacrifice ({%deva-yajana%}).
Thus, when strictly applied, Kṣatriya would have a wider
denotation than Rājanya. As a rule, however, the two
expressions are identical, and both are used as evidence in
what follows. That Kṣatriya ever included the mere fighting
[Page1-204+ 72]
man has not been proved: in the Rigveda<sup>9</sup> and later<sup>10</sup> others
than Kṣatriyas regularly fought; but possibly if the nobles had
retinues as the kings had, Kṣatriya would embrace those
retainers who had military functions. The term did not apply
to all members of the royal entourage; for example, the
{@Grāmaṇī@} was usually a Vaiśya.
<div n="P"/>The connexion of the Kṣatriyas with the Brahmins was very
close. The prosperity of the two is repeatedly asserted<sup>11</sup> to
be indissolubly associated, especially in the relation of king
({@Rājan@}) and domestic priest ({@Purohita@}). Sometimes there was
feud between Kṣatriya and Brahmin.<sup>12</sup> His management of the
sacrifice then gave the Brahmin power to ruin the Kṣatriya by
embroiling him with the people<sup>13</sup> or with other Kṣatriyas.<sup>14</sup>
<div n="P"/>Towards the common people, on the other hand, the Kṣa-
triya stood in a relation of well-nigh unquestioned superiority.<sup>15</sup>
There are, however, references to occasional feuds between
[Page1-205+ 60]
the people and the nobles,<sup>16</sup> in which no doubt the inferior
numbers of the latter were compensated by their superior arms
and prowess. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>17</sup> the Vaiśya is
described as tributary to another ({%anyasya bali-kṛt%}), to be
devoured by another ({%anyasyādya%}), and to be oppressed at will
({%yathākāma-jyeya%}). Probably these epithets apply most strictly
to the relation of the king and his people, but the passage
shows that the people were greatly at the mercy of the nobles.
No doubt the king granted to them the right, which may have
been hereditary, to be supported by the common people,
whose feudal superiors they thus became. In return for these
privileges the Kṣatriyas had probably duties of protection to
perform, as well as some judicial functions, to judge from an
obscure passage of the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā.<sup>18</sup>
<div n="P"/>The main duty of the Kṣatriya in the small states<sup>19</sup> of the
Vedic period was readiness for war. The bow is thus his
special attribute,<sup>20</sup> just as the goad is that of the agriculturist;
for the bow is the main weapon of the Veda. Whether the
Kṣatriyas paid much attention to mental occupations is
uncertain. In the latest stratum of the Brāhmaṇa literature
there are references to learned princes like {@Janaka@} of {@Videha,@}
who is said to have become a Brahmin ({%brahmā%}), apparently in
the sense that he had the full knowledge which a Brahmin
possessed.<sup>21</sup> Other learned Kṣatriyas of this period were
[Page1-206+ 62]
{@Pravāhaṇa Jaivali,@}<sup>22</sup> {@Aśvapati Kaikeya,@}<sup>23</sup> and Ajātaśatru.<sup>24</sup>
Garbe,<sup>25</sup> Grierson,<sup>26</sup> and others believe they are justified in
holding the view that the Ksatriyas developed a special
philosophy of their own as opposed to Brahminism, which
appears later as Bhakti, or Faith. On the other hand, there
is clear evidence<sup>27</sup> that the opinion of Ksatriyas on such topics
were held in little respect, and it must be remembered that to
attribute wisdom to a king was a delicate and effective piece
of flattery. There are earlier references to royal sages ({%rājan-%}
{%yarṣi%}),<sup>28</sup> but it is very doubtful if much stress can be laid on
them, and none can be laid on the later tradition of Sāyaṇa.<sup>29</sup>
Again, the Nirukta<sup>30</sup> gives a tradition relating how {@Devāpi,@}
a king's son, became the Purohita of his younger brother
{@Śaṃtanu;@} but it is very doubtful if the story can really be
traced with Sieg<sup>31</sup> in the Rigveda<sup>32</sup> itself. In any case, the
stories refer only to a few selected Kṣatriyas of high rank,
while there is no evidence that the average Kṣatriya was
concerned with intellectual pursuits. Nor is there any
reference to Kṣatriyas engaging in agriculture or in trade
or commerce. It may be assumed that the duties of
administration and war were adequate to absorb his atten-
tion. On the other hand, we do hear of a Rājanya
[Page1-207+ 54]
as a lute player and singer at the Aśvamedha or horse
sacrifice.<sup>33</sup>
<div n="P"/>Of the training and education of a Kṣatriya we have no
record; presumably, as in fact if not in theory later on, he was
mainly instructed in the art of war, the science of the bow, and
the rudimentary administrative functions which would devolve
on him. At this early state of the development of the nobility
which appears to be represented in the Rigveda, it was probably
not unusual or impossible for a Vaiśya to become a Kṣatriya;
at least, this assumption best explains the phrase<sup>34</sup> ‘claiming
falsely a Kṣatriya's rank’ ({%kṣatriyaṃ mithuyā dhārayantam%}).
<div n="P"/>The king and the Kṣatriyas must have stood in a particularly
close relation. The former being the Kṣatriya {%par excellence,%}
it is to him rather than to the ordinary Kṣatriya that we must
refer passages like that in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>35</sup> where it
is said that the Kṣatriya, with the consent of the clansmen,
gives a settlement to a man: clearly a parallel to the rule found
among many peoples that the chief, but only with the consent of
the people, can make a grant of unoccupied land. In the same
Brāhmaṇa<sup>36</sup> it is said that a Kṣatriya consecrates a Kṣatriya, a
clear reference, as the commentator explains, to the practice of
the old king consecrating the prince ({%kumāra%}) who is to succeed
him; and again,<sup>37</sup> the Kṣatriya and the Purohita are regarded
as alone complete in contrast with other people, the parallel
with the Purohita here suggesting that the Kṣatriya {%par excellence%}
is meant. On the other hand, the king is sometimes con-
trasted with the Rājanya.<sup>38</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Sūtra literature contains elaborate rules<sup>39</sup> for the educa-
[Page1-208+ 49]
tion and occupations of Kṣatriyas, but their contents cannot
always be traced in the Brāhmaṇa literature, and their value is
questionable.

the Rājanya to all other castes is
asserted in Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5,

Brahmin to the Kṣatriya is sometimes
asserted — {%e.g.,%} in the Atharvaveda

iv. 3, 8; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxi. 21;
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 1, 9, 1;
3, 7, 8. So the Rājasūya sacrifice of
the king is inferior to the highest
sacrifice (the Vājapeya) of the priest
({%ibid.,%} v. 1, 1, 12), and though the
Brahmin goes after the king, he is yet
stronger than he (v. 4, 2, 7, and v. 4,

prosperity of the Kṣatriya (called, as
