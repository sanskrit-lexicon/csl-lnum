{@Anas.@}¦ — This is the term<sup>1</sup> used to designate the draft wagon,
as opposed to the chariot ({%ratha%}) for war or sport, with which
it is sometimes expressly contrasted,<sup>2</sup> though Indra is once said
to be ‘seated in a wagon’ ({%anar-viś%})<sup>3</sup> instead of on a chariot.
Though Uṣas, Goddess of Dawn, sometimes rides on a chariot
({%ratha%}), the wagon is her characteristic vehicle.<sup>4</sup> Of its con-
struction we know little. The bridal wagon on which Sūryā,
the daughter of the Sun, was borne in the marriage hymn in the
Rigveda had a covering ({@Chadis@}).<sup>5</sup> The axle-box ({@Kha@}) is also
[Page1-022+ 56]
mentioned.<sup>6</sup> In the Atharvaveda<sup>7</sup> Vipatha appears to denote a
rough vehicle used for bad tracks. The wagon was usually
drawn by oxen ({@Anaḍvāh@}), as in wedding processions.<sup>8</sup> The
wagon of Dawn is described as drawn by ruddy cows or bulls.<sup>9</sup>
