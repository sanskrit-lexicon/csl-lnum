{@Daiva-vāta,@}¦ ‘descendant of {@Devavāta,@}’ is the patronymic of
{@Sṛñjaya,@} probably the Sṛñjaya king, in the Rigveda. He is
mentioned<sup>1</sup> as a devotee of the fire cult, and as victorious over
the {@Turvaśa@} king and the {@Vṛcīvants.@}<sup>2</sup> According to Zimmer,<sup>3</sup>
his name was {@Abhyāvartin Cāyamāna Pārthava@} (‘descendant
of Pṛthu’), but Hillebrandt<sup>4</sup> recognizes this as doubtful, though
he none the less places the Sṛñjayas to the west of the Indus
with {@Divodāsa.@} What is more important is to note that the
name suggests connexion with the Bharata {@Devavāta,@} and as
{@Kurus@} and Sṛñjayas were closely connected<sup>5</sup> this is not
immaterial.
