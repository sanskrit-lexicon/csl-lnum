{@Ahi.@}¦ — This word occurs frequently from the Rigveda<sup>1</sup>
onwards to denote ‘snake.’ Reference is several times<sup>2</sup> made
to its casting its slough. Mention is also made of the serpent's
peculiar movement,<sup>3</sup> which earns for it the designation<sup>4</sup> of
‘the toothed rope’ ({%datvatī rajjuḥ%}). The poisonous character
[Page1-051+ 39]
of its bite is spoken of,<sup>5</sup> as well as the torpidity of the reptile
in winter, when it creeps into the earth.<sup>6</sup> The cast skin is
used as an amulet against highwaymen.<sup>7</sup> Mention is made of
a mythical horse, Paidva, which the Aśvins gave to Pedu as
a protection against snakes,<sup>8</sup> and which is invoked as a
destroyer of serpents.<sup>9</sup> The ichneumon ({%nakula%}) is regarded
as their deadly enemy, and as immune against their poison
through the use of a healing plant,<sup>10</sup> while men kill them with
sticks<sup>11</sup> or strike off their heads.<sup>12</sup>
