{@Stha-pati@}¦ is the name of a royal official mentioned in the
Atharvaveda,<sup>1</sup> and often later.<sup>2</sup> {@Revottaras Cākra@} was the
Sthapati of the exiled {@Duṣṭarītu Pauṃsāyana,@} a king of the
{@Sṛñjayas,@} and succeeded in restoring him to his royal dignity.<sup>3</sup>
The exact sense of the term is not certain: ‘governor’<sup>4</sup> is
possible, but perhaps ‘chief judge’<sup>5</sup> is more likely; as in the
case of the early English judges, his functions may have been
both executive and judicial. He is inferior in position to the
king's brother.<sup>6</sup>

perhaps ‘governor of {@Niṣādas.@}’ But
it may also mean ({%cf.%} Weber, {%Indische%}
{%Studien,%} 1, 207, n.) a Niṣāda as a
Sthapati; thus, little can be deduced
from this passage in particular. Eggel-

renders it ‘governor.’ {%Cf.%} also St.
