{@Atharvāṅgirasaḥ.@}¦ — This is the collective name of the Athar-
vaveda in several passages<sup>1</sup> of the later Brāhmaṇas. It occurs
once in the Atharvaveda itself,<sup>2</sup> while the term Atharvaveda
is not found before the Sūtra period.<sup>3</sup> The compound seems,
according to Bloomfield,<sup>4</sup> to denote the two elements which
make up the Atharvaveda. The former part refers to the aus-
picious practices of the Veda ({%bheṣajāni%});<sup>5</sup> the latter to its hostile
witchcraft, the {%yātu%}<sup>6</sup> or {%abhi-cāra.%}<sup>7</sup> This theory is supported by
the names of the two mythic personages {@Ghora Āṅgirasa@} and
{@Bhiṣaj Ātharvaṇa,@} as well as by the connection of Atharvāṇaḥ
and {@Ātharvaṇāni@} with healing ({%bheṣaja%}) in the Pañcaviṃśa
Brāhmaṇa.<sup>8</sup> Moreover, the term {%bhesajā%} (‘remedies’) designates
in the Atharvaveda<sup>9</sup> that Veda itself, while in the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa<sup>10</sup> {%yātu%} (‘sorcery’) conveys the same meaning. The
evidence, however, being by no means convincing, it remains
probable that there existed no clear differentiation between the
two sages as responsible for the Atharvaveda as a whole.
