{@Sāṃvaraṇi@}¦ is found in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> in one passage, where it
naturally seems to be a patronymic (‘descendant of Saṃ-
varaṇa’) of Manu. According to Bloomfield,<sup>2</sup> it is a corrup-
tion for {@Sāvarṇi,@} a reference to Manu's birth from the {%savarṇā,%}
‘similar’ female who was substituted for Saraṇyū according to
the legend (see {@Manu@}). This is possible, but not certain.
Scheftelowitz<sup>3</sup> thinks that the reading of the Kaśmir manu-
script of the Rigveda, which has {%sāṃvaraṇam,%} ‘found on the
sacrificial ground,’ as an epithet of Soma, is to be preferred.
But this seems quite improbable.<sup>4</sup> We must either recognize
a real man called Manu Sāṃvaraṇi; or take Manu as one name,
Sāṃvaraṇi as another; or admit that Manu Sāṃvaraṇi is
simply Manu with a patronymic derived from an unknown
legend.
