{@Kaṇva@}¦ is the name of an ancient Ṛṣi repeatedly referred to
in the Rigveda and later.<sup>1</sup> His sons and descendants,<sup>2</sup> the
Kaṇvas, are also often mentioned, especially in the eighth
book of the Rigveda, the authorship of that book, as well as of
part of the first, being attributed to this family. A descendant
of Kaṇva is also denoted by the name in the singular, either
alone<sup>3</sup> or accompanied by a patronymic, as Kaṇva Nārṣada<sup>4</sup>
and Kaṇva Śrāyasa,<sup>5</sup> besides in the plural the Kaṇvas Sauśra-
vasas.<sup>6</sup> The Kaṇva family appears to have been connected with
the Atri family,<sup>7</sup> but not to have been of great importance.<sup>8</sup> In
one passage of the Atharvaveda<sup>9</sup> they seem to be definitely
regarded with hostility.
