{@Jyā-hroḍa@}¦ occurs in the description of the arms of the
{@Vrātya@} in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>1</sup> and is also mentioned
in the Sūtras.<sup>2</sup> The sense is somewhat obscure, for one Sūtra
describes it as a ‘bow not meant for use’ ({%ayogyaṃ dhanus%}),<sup>3</sup>
while the other speaks of it as a ‘bow without an arrow’
({%dhanuṣka aniṣu%}).<sup>4</sup> Some sort of a bow, therefore, seems to be
meant.
