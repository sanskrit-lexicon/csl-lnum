{@Salva@}¦ is the name of a people mentioned in a passage of the
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>1</sup> which records a boast by {@Śyāparṇa@}
{@Sāyakāyana@} that if a certain rite of his had been completed,
his race would have been the nobles, Brahmins, and peasants
of the Salvas, and even as it was his race would surpass
the Salvas. This people appears also to be alluded to as
{%Sālvīḥ (prajāḥ)%} in the Mantra Pāṭha,<sup>2</sup> where they are said to
have declared that their king was {@Yaugandhari@} when they
stayed their chariots<sup>3</sup> on the banks of the {@Yamunā.@} There is
later evidence<sup>4</sup> indicating that the Sālvas or Śālvas were
closely connected with the {@Kuru-Pañcālas,@} and that apparently
some of them, at least, were victorious near the banks of
the Yamunā. There is no good evidence to place them in the
north-west in Vedic times.<sup>5</sup>

<F>3) Winternitz, {%Mantra-pāṭha,%} xlv-xlvii,
sees in the verse an allusion to the
Sālva women turning round the wheel
(? spinning-wheel). But a reference
to a warlike raid seems more plau-
aible.</F>
