{@Palli-gupta Lauhitya@}¦ (‘descendant of Lohita’) is mentioned
in a Vaṃśa (‘list of teachers’) in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad
Brāhmaṇa (iii. 42, 1) as a pupil of {@Śyāmajayanta Lauhitya.@}
[Page1-507+ 37]
The name is obviously a late one, for Palli is not found in the
early literature, and the name of the Lauhitya family is other-
wise known in post-Vedic works only.
