{@Madhyama-śī@}¦ is found in one passage of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> where
Roth<sup>2</sup> assigns to the word the meaning of {%intercessor,%} which
Zimmer<sup>3</sup> accepts, in the sense of ‘mediator’ or ‘arbiter,’ as a

intended to express ‘adversary’ or ‘preventer’ of the disease

‘neutral’ between two enemies, is intended.
