{@Didhiṣū-pati@}¦ occurs in the Kāṭhaka<sup>1</sup> and Kapiṣṭhala Saṃ-
hitās,<sup>2</sup> as well as in the Āpastamba,<sup>3</sup> Gautama,<sup>4</sup> and Vasiṣṭha
[Page1-360+ 55]
Dharma Sūtras,<sup>5</sup> in lists of people who have committed sin
({%enas%}). The traditional rendering<sup>6</sup> is ‘husband of a woman
married a second time’; Manu<sup>7</sup> seems to apply the term to the
brother-in-law who is ‘married’ to his sister-in-law after his
brother's death for the purpose of begetting a child, if he
displays conjugal affection to her ({%anurajyate kāmataḥ%}).<sup>8</sup> This
sense would be possible, since {@Didhiṣu@} denotes a ‘wooer,’ and
a widow could be regarded as a ‘wooer’ when able to control
her own choice of a spouse. But another tradition<sup>9</sup> holds that
Didhiṣū means the elder sister whose younger sister has
married before her. This view is supported by a passage in the
Vasiṣṭha Dharma Sūtra,<sup>10</sup> and by the use of the word {%agre-%}
{%didhiṣū-pati,%}<sup>11</sup> which must mean the ‘husband of a younger
sister married before the elder.’ In this case also Didhiṣū
would mean ‘wooer,’ the elder sister being so called because,
if her parents do not arrange a marriage for her, she is,
according to Viṣṇu,<sup>12</sup> to make her own choice of a husband
({%kuryāt svayaṃvaram%}). See also {@Edidhiṣuḥpati@} and {@Daidhi-@}
