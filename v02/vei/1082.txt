{@Jñāti@}¦ (masc.), a word which originally seems to have meant
‘acquaintance,’<sup>1</sup> denotes in the Rigveda<sup>2</sup> and later<sup>3</sup> a ‘relation,’
apparently one who was connected by blood on the father's
side, though the passages do not necessarily require the
limitation. But this sense follows naturally enough from the
patriarchal basis of Vedic society.<sup>4</sup>
<F>1) Being in all probability derived
from {%jñā,%} ‘know,’ not from {%jan,%} ‘beget,’
as would at first sight seem more likely
on account of the sense. {%Cf.%} the
St. Petersburg Dictionary, {%s.v.%}</F>
<F>2) vii. 55, 5, seems to refer to the
members of the joint family sleeping
in the paternal house; x. 66, 14; 85,
28 (the kinsmen of the bride are
meant); 117, 9 (perhaps ‘brother and
sister’ are meant by {%jñātī%} here, but
‘kinsfolk’ will do; {%of.%} Muir, {%Sanskrit%}
{%Texts,%} 5, 432).</F>
<F>3) Av. xii. 5, 44 (where Whitney in
his Translation renders the word by
‘acquaintances,’ which seems too vague
and feeble); Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 6,
5, 2; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 4, 3
({%jñātibhyāṃ vā sakhibhyāṃ, vā,%} ‘where
‘relations’ are contrasted with ‘friends’
or ‘companions’); ii. 2, 2, 20; 5, 2,
20; xi. 3, 3, 7, etc.</F>
<F>4) For the transition from the etymo-
logical meaning, {%cf.%} <lang n="greek">γνωτός, γνωτή</lang>,
which in Homer designate ‘brother’
and ‘sister’; St. Petersburg Dic-
tionary, {%s.v.%}</F>
