{@Śmaśāna@}¦ is the name of the ‘burial mound’ in which the
bones of the dead man were laid to rest ({%cf.%} {@Anagnidagdha@}).
It is mentioned in the Atharvaveda,<sup>1</sup> and often later.<sup>2</sup> The
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> prescribes a four-cornered mound facing
the south-east, on ground inclined to the north, out of sight of
the village, in a peaceful spot amid beautiful surroundings, or
on barren ground. For an Agni-cit (‘builder of a fire-latar’)
a funeral mound like a fire-altar is prescribed. The Easterners
({%Prācyāḥ%}) made their mounds round.
