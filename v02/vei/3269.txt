<L>3269<pc>2-378<k1>Sigru<k2>Sigru
{@Śigru@}¦ is the name of a tribe occurring in the passage of the
Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> in which they are mentioned with the {@Ajas@} and the
{@Yakṣus@} as having been defeated by the {@Tṛtsus@} and King {@Sudās.@}
It is impossible to say whether they were or were not under
the leadership of {@Bheda,@} as Ludwig<sup>2</sup> plausibly suggests. If
Sigru is connected with the later {%śigru,%} ‘horse-radish’ ({%Moringa%}
{%pterygosperma%}), which is quite probable, it is possible that the
tribe was totemistic and non-Āryan, but this is a mere matter
of conjecture.<sup>3</sup> The {@Matsyas@} (‘Fishes’) were probably Āryan.
