{@Kutsa Aurava@}¦ (‘son of Uru’) is mentioned in the Pañca-
viṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> as having murdered his domestic priest
({%purohita%}), {@Upagu Sauśravasa,@} because the father of the latter
insisted on paying homage to Indra. This fact may be com-
pared with the hostility to Indra of {@Kutsa@} according to certain
passages of the Rigveda.<sup>2</sup>
