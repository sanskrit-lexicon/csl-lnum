{@Ātharvaṇa,@}¦ a patronymic formed from the name of the
mythic Atharvan, is found normally in the plural neuter as a
designation of the hymns of the Atharvans. This use appears
in the late nineteenth book of the Atharvaveda,<sup>1</sup> and in the
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.<sup>2</sup> In the singular the expression
Ātharvaṇa (Veda), though not occurring till the Chāndogya
Upaniṣad,<sup>3</sup> is earlier than the term ‘Atharvaveda,’ which is
first found in the Sūtras.<sup>4</sup> In the Nidāna Sūtra<sup>5</sup> Ātharvaṇikas,
or ‘followers of the Atharvaveda,’ appear.
