1. {@Purāṇa,@}¦ denoting a tale ‘of olden times,’ is often found<sup>1</sup>
in the combination Itihāsa-Purāṇa, which is probably a
Dvandva compound meaning ‘{@Itihāsa@} and Purāṇa.’ It some-
times<sup>2</sup> occurs as a separate word, but beside Itihāsa, no doubt
with the same sense as in the Dvandva. Sāyaṇa<sup>3</sup> defines a
Purāṇa as a tale which deals with the primitive condition of
the universe and the creation of the world, but there is no
ground for supposing that this view is correct, or for clearly
distinguishing Itihāsa and Purāṇa. See {@Itihāsa.@}
