{@Mātur-bhrātra@}¦ is a curiously formed compound, occurring
once in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>1</sup> as a designation of the
‘maternal uncle,’ who in the Sūtra period bears the name of
{@Mātula.@} Thus little is heard of the maternal uncle in the
Vedic period: it is not till the Epic<sup>2</sup> that traces appear of his
prominence as compared with the paternal uncle ({%pitṛvya%}).
This fact is significant for the ‘patriarchal’ character of the
early Indian family organization.<sup>3</sup>
