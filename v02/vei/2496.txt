{@Muni@}¦ occurs in one hymn of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> where it seems to
denote an ascetic of magic powers with divine afflatus ({%deveṣita%}),
the precursor of the strange ascetics of later India. This
agrees with the fact that {@Aitaśa,@} the Muni, is in the Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> regarded by his son as deranged, a view not
unjustified if the nonsense which passes as the Aitaśapralāpa.<sup>3</sup>
‘Chatter of Aitaśa,’ was really his. The Rigveda<sup>4</sup> calls Indra
the ‘friend of Munis,’ and the Atharvaveda<sup>5</sup> refers to a ‘divine
Muni’ ({%deva muni%}), by whom a similar ascetic may be meant.
<div n="P"/>In the Upaniṣads<sup>6</sup> the Muni is of a more restrained type:
he is one who learns the nature of the Brahman, the Absolute,
by study, or sacrifice, or penance, or fasting, or faith ({%śraddhā%}).
It must not of course be thought that there is any absolute
distinction between the older Muni and the later: in both
cases the man is in a peculiar ecstatic condition, but the ideal
of the Upaniṣads is less material than the earlier picture of the
Muni, who is more of a ‘medicine man’ than a sage. Nor
would it be wise to conclude from the comparative rareness
[Page2-168+ 39]
of the mention of the Muni in the Vedic texts that he was
an infrequent figure in Vedic times: he was probably not
approved by the priests who followed the ritual, and whose
views were essentially different from the ideals of a Muni,
which were superior to earthly considerations, such as the
desire for children and {@Dakṣiṇās.@}<sup>7</sup>
