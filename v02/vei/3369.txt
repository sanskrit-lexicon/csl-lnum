{@Śyena@}¦ is the name in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> of a strong bird of prey,
most probably the ‘eagle’; later<sup>2</sup> (as in post-Vedic Sanskrit)
it seems to mean the ‘falcon’ or ‘hawk.’ It is the swiftest of
birds,<sup>3</sup> and a source of terror to smaller birds.<sup>4</sup> It is the
strongest of birds,<sup>5</sup> and even attacks herds.<sup>6</sup> It watches over
men ({%nṛ-cakṣas%}),<sup>7</sup> a reference, no doubt, to its lofty flight in air.
It brings the Soma from heaven.<sup>8</sup>
