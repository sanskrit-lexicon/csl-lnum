{@Sarayu@}¦ is mentioned thrice in the Rigveda as the name of
river. {@Citraratha@} and Arṇa are said to have been defeated
apparently by the {@Turvaśas@} and {@Yadus@} who crossed the
[Page2-434+ 62]
Sarayu.<sup>1</sup> Sarayu appears in one passage with {@Sarasvatī@} and
{@Sindhu,@}<sup>2</sup> and in another with {@Rasā, Anitabhā,@} and {@Kubha.@}<sup>3</sup>
Later, in the post-Vedic period, Sarayū, rarely Sarayu, is the
name of a river in Oudh, the modern Sarjū.<sup>4</sup> Zimmer<sup>5</sup> regards
this as the river meant in all the Vedic passages, seeing in the
last,<sup>3</sup> which may be used as an argument for locating the
Sarayu in the Panjab, a reference to the north-east monsoon as
well as to the usual monsoon from the west. Hopkins<sup>6</sup> thinks
that the Sarayu is to be found in the west, and Ludwig<sup>7</sup>
identifies it with the Kurum ({@Krumu@}). Vivien de St. Martin
considered it to be probably identical with the united course of
the {@Śutudrī@} (Sutlej) and {@Vipāś@} (Beas).
<F>1) iv. 30, 18. This passage gives no
help, because the possibility is open
either to suppose that the Turvaśa,
Yadu are not mentioned as defeating
the Āryans Citraratha and Arṇa; or,
if they are, to suppose that they may
have come east against the two.</F>

<F>4) This is a tributary joining the
Gogrā, the great river of Oudh, on
the left of its upper course. The name
Sarjū is also applied to the Gogrā itself
below {@Bahrāmghāt.@} A branch of the
Lower Gogrā, given off on the right,
flowing in an old bed of the Gogrā,
and falling into the Ganges after passing
Balliā, is called the Chhotī (Lesser)
Sarjū. {%Cf. Imperial Gazetteer of India,%}
