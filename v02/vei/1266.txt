{@Daśan,@}¦ ‘ten,’ forms the basis of the numerical system of the
Vedic Indians, as it does of the Āryan people generally. But
it is characteristic of India<sup>1</sup> that there should be found at a
very early period long series of names for very high numerals,
whereas the Āryan knowledge did not go beyond 1,000. In
the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>2</sup> the list is 1; 10; 100; 1,000; 10,000
({%ayuta%}); 100,000 ({%niyuta%}); 1,000,000 ({%prayuta%}); 10,000,000 ({%arbuda%});
100,000,000 ({%nyarbuda%}); 1,000,000,000 ({%samudra%}); 10,000,000,000
({%madhya%}); 100,000,000,000 ({%anta%}); 1,000,000,000,000 ({%parārdha%}).
In the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>3</sup> the list is the same, but {%niyuta%} and
{%prayuta%} exchange places, and after {%nyarbuda%} a new figure
({%badva%}) intervenes, thus increasing {%samudra%} to 10,000,000,000,
and so on. The Taittirīya Saṃhitā has in two places<sup>4</sup> exactly
the same list as the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā. The Maitrāyaṇī
Saṃhitā<sup>5</sup> has the list {%ayuta, prayuta,%} then {%ayuta%} again, {%arbuda,%}
{%nyarbuda, samudra, madhya, anta, parārdha.%} The Pañcaviṃśa
Brāhmaṇa<sup>6</sup> has the Vājasaneyi list up to {%nyarbuda%} inclusive,
then follow {%nikharvaka, badva, akṣita,%} and apparently {%go%} =
1,000,000,000,000. The Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa<sup>7</sup> list
[Page1-343+ 58]
replaces {%nikharvaka%} by {%nikharva, badva%} by {%padma,%} and ends
with {%akṣitir vyomāntaḥ.%} The Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>8</sup> con-
tinues the series after {%nyarbuda%} with {%nikharvāda, samudra,%}
{%salila, antya, ananta%} (= 10 billions).
<div n="P"/>But beyond {%ayuta%}<sup>9</sup> none of these numbers has any vitality.
{%Badva,%} indeed, occurs in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>10</sup> but it
cannot there have any precise numerical sense;<sup>11</sup> and later on
the names of these high numerals are very much confused.
<div n="P"/>An arithmetical progression of some interest is found in the
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>12</sup> where occurs a list of sacrificial gifts
in which each successive figure doubles the amount of the
preceding one. It begins with {%dvādaśa-mānaṃ hiraṇyam,%} ‘gold
to the value of 12’ (the unit being uncertain, but probably the
{@Kṛṣṇala@}),<sup>13</sup> followed by ‘to the value of 24, 48, 96, 192, 384,
768, 1,536, 3072,’ then {%dve aṣṭāviṃśati-śata-māne,%} which must
mean 2×128×24 (the last unit being not a single {%māna,%} but
a number of 24 {%mānas%}) = 6,144, then 12,288, 24,576, 49,152,
98,304, 196,608, 393, 216. With these large numbers may be
compared the minute theoretical subdivision of time found
in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>14</sup> where a day is divided into
15 {%muhūrtas%} — 1 {%muhūrta%} = 15 {%kṣipras,%} 1 {%kṣipra%} = 15 {%etarhis,%}
1 {%etarhi%} = 15 {%idānis,%} 1 {%idāni%} = 15 {%prāṇas.%} The Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta
Sūtra<sup>15</sup> has a decimal division of the day into 15 {%muhūrtas%} — 
1 {%muhūrta%} = 10 {%nimeṣas,%} 1 {%nimeṣa%} = 10 {%dhvaṃsis.%}
<div n="P"/>Few fractions are mentioned in Vedic literature. {%Ardha,%}
{%pāda, śapha,%} and {%kalā%} denote (1/2), (1/4), (1/8), (1/16) respectively, but only
[Page1-344+ 61]
the first two are common. {%Tṛtīya%} denotes the third part.<sup>16</sup>
In the Rigveda<sup>17</sup> Indra and Viṣṇu are said to have divided
1,000 by 3, though how they did so is uncertain. {%Tri-pād%}
denotes ‘three-fourths.’<sup>18</sup>
<div n="P"/>There is no clear evidence that the Indians of the Vedic
period had any knowledge of numerical figures, though it is
perfectly possible.<sup>19</sup>
