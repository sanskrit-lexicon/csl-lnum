{@Kravaṇa,@}¦ a word occurring only once in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> is
understood by Ludwig<sup>2</sup> as the name of the Hotṛ priest or the
sacrificer. Roth considered it an adjective without at first<sup>3</sup>
assigning a sense, but afterwards<sup>4</sup> as meaning ‘timid.’ Sāyaṇa
interprets it as ‘worshipping.’ Oldenberg<sup>5</sup> considers the meaning
uncertain, suggesting as possible ‘the slayer of the victim.’
