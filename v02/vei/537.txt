{@Kalaśa@}¦ is, from the Rigveda onwards,<sup>1</sup> a common word for
‘pot’ or ‘jar,’ probably either formed of a gourd or made of
clay (unburnt or baked), as we know that both kinds of pot
were in use.<sup>2</sup> The wooden Soma tub ({%droṇa-kalaśa%}) is frequently
referred to in the ritual. See also {@Kośa.@}
