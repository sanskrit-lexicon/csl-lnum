{@Ekāṣṭakā.@}¦ — That Aṣṭakā is the eighth day after the full
moon appears clearly from the Atharvaveda.<sup>1</sup> Ekāṣṭakā, or
‘sole Aṣṭakā,’ must denote not merely any Aṣṭakā, but some
particular one. Sāyaṇa, in his commentary on the Atharva-
veda,<sup>2</sup> in which a whole hymn celebrates the Ekāṣṭakā, fixes
the date meant by the term as the eighth day in the dark half
of the month of Māgha (January — February). The Ekāṣṭakā,
is declared in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>3</sup> to be the time for the
consecration ({%dīkṣā%}) of those who are going to perform a year
long sacrifice. See also {@Māsa.@}
