{@Śreṣṭhin@}¦ occurs in several passages of the Brāhmaṇas,<sup>1</sup>
where the St. Petersburg Dictionary assigns to the word the
sense of ‘a man of consequence.’ It is, however, possible that
[Page2-404+ 48]
the word may already have the sense of the ‘headman of a guild,’
the modern Seth.<sup>2</sup> There is a similar doubt in the use of
{%śraiṣṭhya,%}<sup>3</sup> which is perhaps not merely ‘the foremost place,’ as
usually assumed, but definitely ‘the presidency of a guild.’
<div n="P"/>Guilds are referred to in the Dharma Sūtras,<sup>4</sup> and they play a
considerable part in the Buddhist texts<sup>5</sup> and the Epic.<sup>6</sup> But
the Vedic evidence is inadequate to afford ground for positive
assertion or denial of their existence or organization in Vedic
times.
