{@Vyadhvara,@}¦ ‘perforating,’ designates a worm in one passage
of the Atharvaveda,<sup>1</sup> where there seems to be no good reason
to alter the reading to Vyadvara, though Whitney<sup>2</sup> thinks that
it may rather be connected with {%vi-adhvan%}<sup>3</sup> than with the root
{%vyadh,%} ‘pierce.’<sup>4</sup> The term occurs with {@Maśaka,@} ‘fly,’ in the
Hiraṇyakeśi Gṛhya Sūtra,<sup>5</sup> and perhaps also in another passage
of the Atharvaveda,<sup>6</sup> where, however, both Whitney<sup>7</sup> and
Shaṅkar Paṇḍit read {@Vyadvara.@}
