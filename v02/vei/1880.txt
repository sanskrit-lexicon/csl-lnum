{@Purū-ravas@}¦ is the name of a hero in a hymn of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup>
containing a curious dialogue between him and a nymph,
Urvaśī, an Apsaras. He is also mentioned in the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa,<sup>2</sup> where several verses of the Rigvedic dialogue find
a setting in a continuous story. In the later literature he is
recognized as a king.<sup>3</sup> His name is perhaps intended in one
other passage of the Rigveda.<sup>4</sup> It is impossible to say whether
he is a mythical figure pure and simple, or really an ancient
king. His epithet, Aiḷa,<sup>5</sup> ‘descendant of Iḍā’ (a sacrificial
goddess), is certainly in favour of the former alternative.
