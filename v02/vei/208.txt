{@Ā-khyāna.@}¦ — In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> we hear of the
Śaunaḥśepa Ākhyāna, ‘the story of {@Śunaḥśepa,@}’ which is told
by the Hotṛ priest at the Rājasūya (‘royal inauguration’). The
series of stories<sup>2</sup> used at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’)
during the year while the sacrificial horse is allowed to wander
at its will is called the ‘cyclic’ ({%pari-plavam%}). The Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> mentions also Ākhyāna-vids (‘men versed in
tales’), who tell the Sauparṇa legend, elsewhere<sup>4</sup> known as a
{@Vyākhyāna.@} Yāska, in the Nirukta,<sup>5</sup> frequently uses the term,
sometimes in a pregnant sense as denoting the doctrine of the
Aitihāsikas or traditional interpreters of the Rigveda.<sup>6</sup>
