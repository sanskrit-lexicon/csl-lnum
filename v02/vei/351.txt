{@Uddālaka Āruṇi.@}¦ — Uddālaka, son of Aruṇa, is one of the
most prominent teachers of the Vedic period. He was a Brāh-
maṇa of the Kurupañcālas, according to the Śatapatha Brāh-
maṇa.<sup>1</sup> This statement is confirmed by the fact that he was
teacher of {@Proti Kausurubindi@} of Kauśāmbī,<sup>2</sup> and that his son
[Page1-088+ 60]
{@Svetaketu@} is found disputing among the Pañcālas.<sup>3</sup> He was a
pupil of Aruṇa, his father,<sup>4</sup> as well as of Patañcala Kāpya,<sup>5</sup> of
Madra, while he was the teacher of the famous Yājñavalkya<sup>6</sup>
Vājasaneya and of Kauṣītaki,<sup>7</sup> although the former is represented
elsewhere<sup>8</sup> as having silenced him. He overcame in argument
Prācīnayogya Śauceya,<sup>9</sup> and apparently also Bhadrasena Ājāta-
śatrava,<sup>10</sup> though the text here seems to read the name as
Āraṇi. He was a Gautama,<sup>11</sup> and is often alluded to as such.
As an authority on questions of ritual and philosophy, he is
repeatedly referred to by his patronymic name Āruṇi in the
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>12</sup> the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,<sup>13</sup> the
Chāndogya Upaniṣad,<sup>14</sup> and occasionally in the Aitareya,<sup>15</sup> the
Kauṣītaki,<sup>16</sup> and the Ṣaḍviṃśa<sup>17</sup> Brāhmaṇas, as well as the
Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad.<sup>18</sup> In the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā he is not
mentioned, according to Geldner,<sup>19</sup> but only his father Aruṇa;
his name does not occur, according to Weber,<sup>20</sup> in the Pañca-
viṃśa Brāhmaṇa, but in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>21</sup> he is, as
Āruṇi, known as a contemporary of {@Divodāsa Bhaimaseni,@} and
in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa<sup>22</sup> he is mentioned as
serving {@Vāsiṣṭha Caikitāneya.@} In the Taittirīya tradition he
seldom appears. There is an allusion in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>23</sup>
to Kusurubinda Auddālaki, and according to the Taittirīya
Brāhmaṇa,<sup>24</sup> Naciketas was a son of Vājaśravasa Gautama, who
[Page1-089+ 47]
is made out to be Uddālaka by Sāyaṇa.<sup>25</sup> But the episode of
Naciketas, being somewhat unreal, cannot be regarded as of
historical value in proving relationship. Aruṇa is known to the
Taittirīya Saṃhitā. A real son of Uddālaka was the famous
{@Śvetaketu,@} who is expressly reported by Āpastamba<sup>26</sup> to have
been in his time an Avara or later authority, a statement of
importance for the date of Āruṇi.

is a chronological difficulty in taking
Āruṇi as meant, since Ājātaśatrava
must presumably have been a descen-
dant of Ajātaśatru, a contemporary of
Janaka (see Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, iv. 1),
who again was a patron of Yājñavalkya,
a pupil of Āruṇi. But this difficulty is
not fatal.</F>
