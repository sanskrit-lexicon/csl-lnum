{@Āmbaṣṭhya@}¦ is mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (viii. 21)
as a king, whose priest for the Rājasūya, or royal inauguration,
was {@Nārada.@} Presumably the name is local, meaning ‘King of
[Page1-060+ 43]
the Ambaṣṭhas,’ as interpreted in the St. Petersburg Dictionary.
Later the term Ambaṣṭha denotes ‘a man of mingled Brāhmaṇa
and Vaiśya parentage by father and mother’ respectively.
