{@Dṛṣadvatī,@}¦ ‘stony,’ is the name of a river which flows into
the {@Sarasvatī@} after running for a time parallel to it. It is
mentioned in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> along with the Sarasvatī and the
{@Āpayā,@} as the scene of action of the Bharata princes. In the
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> and later<sup>3</sup> the Dṛṣadvatī and the
Sarasvatī are the scene of special sacrifices. In Manu<sup>4</sup> these
two rivers form the western boundary of the Middle Country.
