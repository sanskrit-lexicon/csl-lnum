{@Saṃ-grahītṛ@}¦ is found in the later Saṃhitās<sup>1</sup> and the Brāh-
maṇas.<sup>2</sup> He is an official who figures among the {@Ratnins@} of
the king. The sense of ‘charioteer’ seems adequate for every
passage, but Sāyaṇa<sup>3</sup> in some passages inclines to think that
the meaning is ‘treasurer’ of the king.
