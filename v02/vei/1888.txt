{@Puro-hita@}¦ (‘placed in front,’ ‘appointed’) is the name of a
priest in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later.<sup>2</sup> The office of Purohita is
called Purohiti<sup>3</sup> and {@Purodhā.@} It is clear that the primary
function of the Purohita was that of ‘domestic priest’ of a
king, or perhaps a great noble; his quite exceptional position
is shown by the fact that only one Purohita seems ever to be
mentioned in Vedic literature.<sup>4</sup> Examples of Purohitas in the
Rigveda are {@Viśvāmitra@}<sup>5</sup> or {@Vasiṣṭha@}<sup>6</sup> in the service of the
{@Bharata@} king; {@Sudās,@} of the {@Tṛtsu@} family; the Purohita of
{@Kuruśravaṇa;@}<sup>7</sup> and {@Devāpi,@} the Purohita of {@Śantanu.@}<sup>8</sup> The
Purohita was in all religious matters the {%alter ego%} of the king.
In the ritual<sup>9</sup> it is laid down that a king must have a Purohita,
else the gods will not accept his offerings. He ensures the
king's safety and victory in battle by his prayers;<sup>10</sup> he procures
[Page2-006+ 56]
the fall of rain for the crops;<sup>11</sup> he is the flaming fire that
guards the kingdom.<sup>12</sup> Divodāsa in trouble is rescued by
Bharadvāja;<sup>13</sup> and King {@Tryaruṇa Traidhātva Aikṣvāka@}
reproaches his Purohita, {@Vṛśa Jāna,@} when his car runs over
a Brahmin boy and kills him.<sup>14</sup> The close relation of king and
Purohita is illustrated by the case of {@Kutsa Aurava,@} who slew
his Purohita, {@Upagu Sauśravasa,@} for disloyalty in serving
Indra, to whom Kutsa was hostile.<sup>15</sup> Other disputes between
kings and priests who officiated for them are those of {@Janam-@}
{@ejaya@} and the {@Kaśyapas,@} and of {@Viśvantara@} and the {@Śyā-@}
{@parṇas;@}<sup>16</sup> and between {@Asamāti@} and the {@Gaupāyanas.@}<sup>17</sup> In
some cases one Purohita served more than one king; for
example, {@Devabhāga Śrautarṣa@} was the Purohita of the
{@Kurus@} and the {@Sṛṅjayas@} at the same time,<sup>18</sup> and {@Jala Jātū-@}
{@karṇya@} was the Purohita of the kings of {@Kāśi, Videha,@} and
{@Kosala.@}<sup>19</sup>
<div n="P"/>There is no certain proof that the office of Purohita was
hereditary in a family, though it probably was so.<sup>20</sup> At any
rate, it seems clear from the relations of the Purohita with
King {@Kuruśravaṇa,@} and with his son {@Upamaśravas,@}<sup>21</sup> that a
king would keep on the Purohita of his father.
<div n="P"/>Zimmer<sup>22</sup> thinks that the king might act as his own Purohita,
as shown by the case of King Viśvantara, who sacrificed with-
out the help of the Śyāparṇas,<sup>23</sup> and that a Purohita need not
be a priest, as shown by the case of Devāpi and Śantanu.<sup>24</sup>
But neither opinion seems to be justified. It is not said that
[Page2-007+ 63]
Viśvantara sacrificed without priests, while Devāpi is not
regarded as a king until the Nirukta,<sup>25</sup> and there is no
reason to suppose that Yāska's view expressed in that work
is correct.
<div n="P"/>According to Geldner,<sup>26</sup> the Purohita from the beginning
acted as the Brahman priest in the sacrificial ritual, being
there the general superintendent of the sacrifice. In favour of
this view, he cites the fact that Vasiṣṭha is mentioned both as
Purohita<sup>27</sup> and as Brahman:<sup>28</sup> at the sacrifice of {@Śunaḥśepa@} he
served as Brahman,<sup>29</sup> but he was the Purohita of Sudās;<sup>30</sup>
Bṛhaspati is called the Purohita<sup>31</sup> and the Brahman<sup>32</sup> of the
gods; and the Vasiṣṭhas who are Purohitas are also the Brah-
mans at the sacrifice.<sup>33</sup> It is thus clear that the Brahman was
often the Purohita; and it was natural that this should be the
case when once the Brahman's place became, as it did in the
later ritual, the most important position at the sacrifice.<sup>34</sup> But
the Brahman can hardly be said to have held this place in the
earlier ritual; Oldenberg<sup>35</sup> seems to be right in holding that
the Purohita was originally the Hotṛ priest, the singer {%par%}
{%excellence,%} when he took any part at all in the ritual of the great
sacrifices with the {@Ṛtvijs.@} So Devāpi seems clearly to have
[Page2-008+ 54]
been a Hotṛ;<sup>36</sup> Agni is at once Purohita<sup>37</sup> and Hotṛ;<sup>38</sup> and the
‘two divine Hotṛs’ referred to in the Āprī litanies are also
called the ‘two Purohitas.’<sup>39</sup> Later, no doubt, when the
priestly activity ceased to centre in the song, the Purohita, with
his skill in magic, became the Brahman, who also required
magic to undo the errors of the sacrifice.<sup>40</sup>
<div n="P"/>There is little doubt that in the original growth of the priest-
hood the Purohita played a considerable part. In historical
times he represented the real power of the kingship, and may
safely be deemed to have exercised great influence in all public
affairs, such as the administration of justice and the king's
conduct of business. But it is not at all probable that the
Purohita represents, as Roth<sup>41</sup> and Zimmer<sup>42</sup> thought, the
source which gave rise to caste. The priestly class is already
in existence in the Rigveda (see {@Varṇa@}).

<F>4) Geldner, {%Vedische Studien,%} 2, 144,
thinks that several Purohitas were
possible, quoting Sāyaṇa, on Rv. x. 57, 1,
who gives the tale of the Gaupāyanas
and King Asamāti from the Śāṭyāya-
naka, and comparing the case of
Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra as Purohitas,
probably contemporaneously, of Sudās.
But that the two were contemporaneous
is most unlikely, especially if we adopt
the very probable view of Hopkins
({%Journal of the American Oriental Society,%}
15, 260 {%et seq.%}) that Viśvāmitra was
with the ten kings (Rv. vii. 18) when
they unsuccessfully attacked Sudās.
The other narrative has, as Oldenberg,
{%Religion des Veda,%} 375, n. 3, observes,
a markedly fictitious character; while
every other passage that mentions a
Purohita speaks of him in the singular,
and as there was only one Brahman
priest at the sacrifice, so the Purohita
acted as Brahman.</F>
