<L>978<pc>1-262<k1>cIpudru<k2>cIpudru
{@Cīpudru@}¦ designates some substance mentioned in a hymn of
the Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup> as of use in healing. The commentator
Sāyaṇa reads Cīpadru, and explains the word as a kind of tree.
This interpretation is supported by the fact that the Kauśika
Sūtra<sup>2</sup> refers to the employment of splinters of Palāśa wood in
the ritual application of this hymn.<sup>3</sup> Whitney<sup>4</sup> suggests that
the form of the word should be Cīpuḍu.
