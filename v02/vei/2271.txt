{@Bhikṣu,@}¦ ‘beggar,’ is a term not found in Vedic literature.
The begging of the {@Brahmacārin@} is quite a different thing from
the duties of the Bhikṣu in the later system of the Āśramas
(religious stages of life), when the Brahmin in the last stage of
his life, after leaving his home and family, lives on alms alone.
See 1. {@Brāhmaṇa.@}
