{@Kumba@}¦ is mentioned with {@Opaśa@} and {@Kurīra@} as an ornament
of women's hair in the Atharvaveda.<sup>1</sup> Geldner<sup>2</sup> thinks that,
like those two words, it originally meant ‘horn,’ but this is
very doubtful. Indian tradition<sup>3</sup> simply regards the term as
denoting a female adornment connected with the dressing of
the hair.
