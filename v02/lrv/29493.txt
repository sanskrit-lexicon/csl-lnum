{#mahA-kAvya#}¦ {%n.%} a great or classical poem; (according to the tradition of the Paṇḍits, these are five, viz., {#raGuvaMSa#}, {#kumArasaMBava#}, {#kirAtArjunIya#}, {#SiSupAlavaDa#} and {#nEzaDacarita#}; sometimes {#meGadUta#} is added to these; but several other poems have an equal title to this name and the enumeration of the Paṇḍits has not much importance).
