{#jAmitra#}¦ {%n.%} The seventh zodiacal sign from the natal one. In astrology, the sign is indicatory of the welfare, or otherwise of one’s wife; hence some derive the word from {#jAyA#}, but it is found to be of Greek origin (Gr. <i>diametron</i>). See <ls>K.S.</ls>vii.1 and <ls>Mall.</ls> on it.
