{#sAMKya#}¦ {%(II) m.%} 1. Name of one of the six systems of Hindu philosophy, ascribed to the sage Kapila and so called as enumerating twenty-five <i>Tatvas</i> or true principles; its object is to effect the final Liberation of the twenty-fifth <i>Tatva</i>, viz., <i>purusha</i> (the soul) from the fetters of the phenomenal creation by conveying a correct knowledge of the twenty-four other <i>Tatvas</i>; the <i>Sānkhya</i> system agrees with Vedāntism in being synthetical, so differing from the analytical <i>Nyāya</i>; its great point of divergence from the <i>Vedānta</i> is its maintaining two principles, which the <i>Vedānta</i> denies; 2. a follower of the <i>Sānkhya</i> system of philosophy.
