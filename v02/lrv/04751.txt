{#AKyAyikA#}¦ {%f.%} A species of prose composition. (Several writers on rhetoric divide prose composition Into {#kaTA#} and {#AKyAyikA#} and try to distingaish them from each other; the {#harzacarita#} of Bāṇa is instanced as an {#AKyAyikA#} and the Kādambarī of the same author as a sample of {#kaTA#}. The <ls>S.D.</ls> thus defines {#AKyAyikA#}- {#kavervaMSAdikIrtanam . asyAmanyakavInAM ca vfttaM gadyaM kvacit kvacit . kaTAMSAnAM vyavacCeda ASvAsa iti baDyate . AryAvaktrApavaktrARAM CaMdasA yena kenacit . anyApadeSenASvAsamuKe BAvyarTasUcanam#}. Danḍin says there is no distinction at all between {#kaTA#} and {#AKyAyikA#}. “{#tatkaTAKyAyiketyekA jAtiH saMjYAdvayAMkitA#}” <ls>K.D.</ls>i.28.) See the quotation under {#AKyAnaka#}.
