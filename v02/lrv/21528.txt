{#parisaMKyA#}¦ {%f.%} 1. Enumeration, computation; 2. sum, total; 3. exclusion of every thing but that which is expressly mentioned, as opposed to {#niyama#} (q.v.) in which where several alternatives are possible the choice is limited to the one expressly mentioned; while {#viDi#} lays down a rule or restriction for the first time; (the familiar instance of {#parisaMKyA#} is {#paMca paMcanaKA BakzyAH#} in <i>Mīmānsa</i> phil.); 4. such an implied exclusion or an expressed one treated as a figure of speech in rhetoric; (in order to be considered a figure of speech, this exclusion must have some charm, i.e. must generally be based on a {#Sleza#}, e.g. {#yasya ca paralokAdBayamaMtaHpurikAlakezu BaMgo nUpurezu muKaratA vivAhezu karagrahaRamanavaratamaKAgniDUmenASrupAtasturaMgezu kaSABiGAto makaraDvaje cApaDvaniraBUt#} <ls>Kad.</ls>)
