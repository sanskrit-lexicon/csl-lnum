{#uttaMsa#}¦ {%m.n.%} 1. An ear-ring, <ls>Bh.V.</ls>ii.55; 2. a crest, an ornament worn on the crown of the head. (Note. When preceded by the word {#karRa#}, {#uttaMsa#} loses part of its original meaning and expresses merely ‘an ornament’ according to some. According to Mammata, the word {#karRa#} expresses in such cases {#karRa sTitatva#}, this, however, being merely a device to explain away the usage of standard authors, {#karRAvataMsAdipade karRAdiDvaninirmitiH . saMniDAnAdiboDArTaM sTitezvetatsamarTanam#} <ls>K.Pr.</ls>vii.).
