{#lawaBa#}¦ {%a. (f. {#BA#})%} This word is found no where in the existing dictionaries, but is used thrice or four times by Bilhaṇa in his <i>Vikramānkadevacharita</i> and once by Bhartṛihari. We are inclined to believe that it is the original Sanskṛit word from which the Prākṛit {#laqaha#} is derived. Of course, it is possible that the Sanskṛit {#lawaBa#} may have been consciously derived from the Prākṛit by the ordinary rules. It means ‘pretty, handsome, attractive,’ {#tasyAH pAdanaKaSreRiH SoBate lawaBaBruvaH#} <ls>Vikr.Ch.</ls>viii.6, {#atikrAMtaH kAlo lawaBalalanABogasulaBaH#} <ls>Bhartr.</ls>iii.32.
