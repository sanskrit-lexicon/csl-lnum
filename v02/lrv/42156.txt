{#sTAlI-pulAka˚nyAya#}¦ {%m.%} the maxim of the cooking-pot and the boiled rice. In a cooking-pot, all the grains are equally moistened by the heated water and so when one knows that one grain is well-cooked, he can draw the same inference as regards all others. From this fact, the maxim is applied to cases where the condition of the whole is inferred from that of a part.
