{#apuzwa#}¦ {%a. (f. {#zwA#})%} 1. Not fat, lean; 2. not loud, not violent; 3. irrelevant, unassisting, as a word (considered in rhetoric as a fault of meaning or sense ({#arTadoza#}); in the instance ‘{#vilokya vitate vyomin viDuM muYca ruzaM priye#},’ ‘{#vitate#}’ is irrelevant because the expansion of the sky has nothing to do with the cessation of anger).
