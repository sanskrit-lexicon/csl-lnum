{#a#}¦ {%(II) ind.%} A prefix implying- (1) negation arising from similarity, (e.g. {#abrAhmaRaH#} one who is not a Brāhmaṇa though like him); (2) privation, (e.g. {#aGawaH#} absence of {#Gawa#}); (3) difference, (e.g. {#apawaH#} other than a {#pawa#}); (4) dimunition, (e.g. {#anudarA#} having a very slender waist); (5) badness, (e.g. {#anAcAraH#} bad conduct); (6) contrariety, (e.g. {#asita#} the contrary of white, i.e. black).These meanings are put together in the following stanza- {#tatsAdfSya maBAvaSca tadanyatvaM tadalpatA . aprASastyaM viroDaSca naYarTAH zaw prakIrtitAH ..#}<P>If the noun to which {#a#} is to be prefixed begins with a vowel, the {#a#} assumes the form {#an#}, (e.g. {#anAcAra#}); but if the vowel following the {#a#} happens to be a {#f#}, this rule is sometimes neglected, (e.g. {#anfRin#} or {#afRin#}).
