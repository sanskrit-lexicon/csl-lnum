{#anya-strI#}¦ {%f.%} a woman not one’s own. In rhetoric, she is one of the three categories of the principal female characters in a poetical composition, the other two being {#svIyA#} and {#sADAraRastrI#}. {#anyastrI#} is either ‘another’s wife,’ or ‘a damsel.’ As ‘another’s wife,’ she is fond of festivals and the like opportunities, is a disgrace to her family, bare of modesty. The ‘damsel’ is one not yet married, bashful and arrived at the age of puberty.
