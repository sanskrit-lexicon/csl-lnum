{#as#}¦ {%(I) vt. or vi. 1U (pp. {#asita#})%} 1. To take, to seize; 2. to go; 3. to shine, {#lAvanya utpAdya ivAsa yatnaH#} <ls>K.S.</ls>i.35, {#nizpraBaSca ripurAsa BUBftAm#} <ls>R.</ls>xi.81. (There is difference of opinion as regards the meaning of {#Asa#} in these verses. <ls>Mall.</ls> seems to follow {#SAkawAyana#} in holding that {#Asa#} is an indeclinable, having the sense of {#baBUva#}. Vallabha, another commentator of Kālidāsa, thinks that it is an ungrammatical form wrongly used by poets. Vāmana derives it from this root (i.e. {#as#} I.) and paraphrases it by {#didIpe#}).
