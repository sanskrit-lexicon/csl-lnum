{#aSoka-vanikAnyAya#}¦ {%m.%} the maxim of the grove of <i>aśoka</i> trees. The maxim takes its origin from Rāvaṇa’s keeping Sītā in an <i>aśoka</i> grove and denotes that, where there are several connections possible, any one of them is as good as another and the preference of one of them cannot be accounted for, as Rāvaṇa’s preference of an {#aSokavanikA#} as a resort for Sītā could not be accounted for.
