? {@nirūha-mārga@}¦, probably a corruption; I cannot offer an interpretation, any more than <ls>Senart</ls>: (yatrāpi) nirūhamārgaṃ pratipadyati <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.223.18〕 (contrasted with {%whenever he dwells near a town or village%}; not however a {%wild%} or {%desert place%}, since the following shows that people were present).
