{@muṣṭi-bandha, -saṃbandha@}¦, <lex>m.</lex>, a particular technique of {%grasping%} (the bow) {%with the fist%} (see <ab>s.v.</ab> {@muṣṭi@}); several times muṣṭi-b° is mentioned in a list of arts to be mastered by a prince: <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔4978〕; <ls>LV</ls> 〔156.12〕; <ls>Divy</ls> 〔100.12〕 and 〔442.7〕, along with {@pada-bandha@} or {@pāda°@}, and (in all but <ls>Divy</ls> 〔100.12〕) also {@śikhā-bandha@}; in both <ls>Divy</ls> passages these words are directly followed by {@dūravedha@}, which occurs not far away in <ls>Mvy</ls> (〔4991〕). That [Page436-a] a manner of wielding the bow is meant is suggested by the context in all, and proved by <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.82.17〕 muṣṭisaṃbandho ca, yatra nāma vārāṇasyāṃ sthitena kāṇḍaṃ kṣiptaṃ. <lang>Tib.</lang> on <ls>Mvy</ls> and <ls>LV</ls> <tib>ḥdzin staṅs</tib>, {%grasping posture%}.
