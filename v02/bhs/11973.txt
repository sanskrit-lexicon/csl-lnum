{@mātrī@}¦, <lex>adj.</lex> <lex>f.</lex> (to <lex>m.</lex> *mātra, from <lang>Skt.</lang> mātṛ plus a?), {%of the mother, maternal%}: (svaka-svakā yeva) mātrīyo bhaginīyo parasparasya vivāhitā <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.351.4〕, (the princes) {%gave to each other in marriage each their own sisters by the same mother%} (thus avoiding the marriage of any with his co-uterine sister). So the <lang>Tib.</lang> version cited by <ls>Senart</ls> 〔p. 625〕; <ls>Senart</ls> misunderstands the <lang>Skt.</lang> text; he reads mātṛyo with <ab>v.l.</ab> (and with both <ab>mss.</ab> line 8 below), but this can only be a corruption. The <lang>Pali</lang> <lex>adj.</lex> mātiya which he cites is not known to <ls>PTSD</ls>; <ls>Childers</ls> cites it with no textual reference; even if a genuine <lang>Pali</lang> word, it can hardly be concerned here.
