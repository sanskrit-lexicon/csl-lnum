{@udyāma@}¦, <lex>m.</lex> (<ab>cf.</ab> <lang>Vedic</lang> <ab>id.</ab>, the <ab>mg.</ab> of which in some places, <ls>ŚB</ls> 〔8.5.1.13〕, is not clear), in sūtrodyāmaḥ <ls>Divy</ls> 〔643.1〕 = 〔644.9〕, perhaps {%extension, drawing out%} (of thread), see <ab>s.v.</ab> {@tatkṣaṇa@}; but the precise meaning of the phrase escapes me. It may mean {%effort, exertion%} (<lang>Skt.</lang> udyama), as in <ls>Aśokan u(y)yāma, Rock Ed.</ls> (Kalsi) 〔13.18〕. In this sense probably read nir-udyāmā, as suggested by <ls>Kashgar rec.</ls>, <ls>SP</ls> 〔100.9〕 (prose).
