{@kuta-lipi@}¦ (or, with <ab>v.l.</ab>, {@kutana-lipi@}), some kind of script: <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.135.6〕. <ls>Senart</ls> thinks of reading kuṭa, referring to Kuṭaka as <ab>n.</ab> of a people, but this is recorded only once from the <ls>BhāgP.</ls>, and seems implausible here. The word seems to correspond to {@kirāta-lipi@} of <ls>LV</ls> 〔125.21〕.
