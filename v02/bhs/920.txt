<L>920<pc>031,1<k1>anupraRiDeti<k2>anu-praRiDeti
{@anu-praṇidheti@}¦ (not in <lang>Pali</lang>), = {@praṇidheti@}, {%makes a vow%} (to persist towards enlightenment); °dheti <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.119.15〕; °dhemi (<ab>mss.</ab> anuparidehi) 〔323.1〕; °dhesi, <lex>aor.</lex>, 〔335.11〕; °hitaṃ, <lex>ppp.</lex>, 〔i.63.3〕. See {@anupraṇidhi@}, which is commoner than the verb. If there is any difference between this and praṇi° without anu, it does not appear clearly; anu does not necessarily imply {%after%} (a gift or meritorious act), <ab>tho</ab> this often precedes; in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.323.1〕 however none is mentioned.
