? {@drāva@}¦, <lex>nt.</lex> (<ab>vv.ll.</ab> drāṣa, naṣa), some part of the body, in a passage (<ab>vss</ab>, <ab>tho</ab> printed as prose) identifying various bodily parts with features of the outside world: (sāgaraś cāpy amedhyaṃ vai) drāvaṃ Brahmā Prajāpatiḥ <ls>Divy</ls> 〔628.29〕. I have no idea what is intended; but sarvaṃ, conjectured in note, seems implausible.
