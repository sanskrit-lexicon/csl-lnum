{@sālambha@}¦, <lex>m.</lex> (may be specialized use of {@sārambha@} = <lang>Pali</lang> <ab>id.</ab>, which so far as I know is not recorded of physical fighting; in some <ls>LV</ls> <ab>mss.</ab> <ab>v.l.</ab> sār° occurs sometimes for this), <ab>app.</ab> {%(contest of) wrestling%}: °bhaḥ <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔4998〕 = <lang>Tib.</lang> <tib>gyad kyi ḥdzin staṅs</tib>, <ab>lit.</ab> {%an athleteʼs style%} (or {%posture%}) {%of grasping%}, <ls>Das</ls> = saṃgrāho mallasya, saṃlambha (! not recorded elsewhere; <ab>prob.</ab> <ls>Das</ls>ʼs ‘correction’ for sāl°), {%‘the mode of seizing in wrestling’%}: (in lists of arts) asi-dhanu(ṣ)kalāpa-yuddha-sālambha- <ls>LV</ls> 〔4.21〕; 〔143.6〕; 〔144.8〕; in all these <lang>Tib.</lang> as on <ls>Mvy</ls> above, and so also for °bha-(dhanurvede) <ls>LV</ls> 〔156.9〕; that {%wrestling%} is meant seems confirmed by <ls>LV</ls> 〔152.10 ff.〕, in which the Bodhisattva defeats the Śākya youths in what can only be {%wrestling%} (<ab>cf.</ab> <ab>esp.</ab> 〔152.18—20〕); our word occurs there several times, Śākyakumārāḥ sālambhāya sthitāḥ 〔152.11〕, {%stood ready for wrestling%}; similarly abhigatau °bhāya 12; °bhāyāgacchata 22; here, [Page594-a] however, <lang>Tib.</lang> renders always by <tib>brgal ba</tib> (once preceded by <tib>stobs</tib>, {%force%}), a general word for {%fight%}.
