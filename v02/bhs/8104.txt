{@navakarmika@}¦ (= <lang>Pali</lang> °kammika, said to mean {%repairer of buildings%}, but see below): <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔8735〕 °kaḥ = <lang>Tib.</lang> <tib>lag gi bla</tib>, which <ls>Das</ls> defines as {%one who does general menial service to the congregation of lamas in a monastery%}; <ls>MSV</ls> 〔i.235.6, 9〕; 〔ii.145.13〕; he was as a rule himself a monk, but inferior in position and function, as shown by <ls>Jm</ls> 〔113.22〕 (<ab>vs</ab>) āvāsikaḥ so 'stu mahāvihāre kacaṅgalāyāṃ navakarmikaś ca (as a punishment). That the navakammika in <lang>Pali</lang>, too, was low in station among monks is shown by the story of Sudhamma, <ls>Vin.</ls> 〔ii.15.30 ff.〕 (āvāsiko … navakammiko dhuvabhattiko), and navakamme in <ls>Jāt.</ls> 〔iv.378.29〕 seems to mean {%manual labor%} (certainly not {%repairing%}, since a new structure was being built). I have found no <lang>Pali</lang> <ab>comm.</ab>ʼs interpretation, but the <lang>Pali</lang> word seems to need reexamination. Perhaps <ab>lit.</ab> {%(one who performs) new-initiateʼs work%} (see {@nava@}).
