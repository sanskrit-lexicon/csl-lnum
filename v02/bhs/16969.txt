{@Sunirmita@}¦, ({@1@}) <lex>m.</lex> (= <lang>Pali</lang> Sunimmita, <ab>cf.</ab> <ls>DN</ls> 〔i.219.4〕), <ab>n.</ab> of the chief of the {@nirmāṇarati@} (also called {@nirmita@}) gods: <ls>LV</ls> 〔44.10〕; 〔59.6〕; 〔302.6〕; 〔362.18〕; 〔363.19〕; 〔441.18〕; <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.208.13〕; 〔263.16〕; 〔ii.11.1〕; 〔iii.315.7〕; <ls>Divy</ls> 〔140.15〕; <ls>Mmk</ls> 〔45.8〕; 〔69.6〕; <ls>Bbh</ls> 〔345.22〕 (in <ls>Mvy</ls> {@Sunirmāṇarati@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>); most occurrences which seem to suggest use in <ab>pl.</ab>, as of the class of nirmita (= nirmāṇarati) gods, are only apparent, see <ab>s.v.</ab> {@Suyāma@} for a number of cases in <ls>Gv</ls>, <ls>Dbh.g.</ls>, and <ls>RP</ls>. However, I have noted two cases where the <ab>pl.</ab> seems unquestionable (unless we resort to emendation), and can only mean the class of which (the <ab>sg.</ab>) Sunirmita is chief: sunirmitāṃ devaputrāṃ paśyati ca svalaṃkṛtāṃ <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.360.4〕 (<ab>vs</ab>); and, in a list of classes of gods, … sunirmitā paranirmitā śuddhāvāsā tuṣitā yāmā … <ls>Mmk</ls> 〔19.12〕 (prose). (But in <ls>LV</ls> 〔241.2〕, for Sunirmiteṣu, read with best <ab>ms.</ab> Sunirmito sa, supported by <lang>Tib.</lang>) Perhaps the fact that nirmita is used of the class, but less regularly than nirmāṇarati, led to occasional confusion with the name of its chieftain: ({@2@}) <lex>nt.</lex>, <ab>n.</ab> of a buddhakṣetra: <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.123.6〕 (<ab>vs</ab>); located in the east.
