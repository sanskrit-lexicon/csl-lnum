This identifies him with <lang>Pali</lang> Kuṇḍa-dhāna (see <ls>DPPN</ls> <ab>s.v.</ab>), a name also applied in <ls>DPPN</ls> to 1 Puṇṇa; Kuṇ° seems to be his regular name, but it is said to have been originally Dhāna, and the prefixation of Kuṇḍa-is explained in a way which would not fit the <lang>BHS</lang> epithet.
