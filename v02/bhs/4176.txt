{@okkarika@}¦, <lex>m.</lex> (= {@aukarika@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>; <ab>acc.</ab> to <ls>Feer, Transl. of Av</ls>, = <lang>Tib.</lang> <tib>yul tsoṅ</tib> [read <tib>tshoṅ</tib>] <tib>pa</tib>, see below), some kind of tradesman; <ls>Feer</ls>, ‘country merchant’; but <tib>yul</tib>, which indeed often means janapada (<ab>opp.</ab> to {%town%}), in <ab>comp.</ab> with <tib>tshoṅ pa</tib>, {%merchant%}, could possibly mean {%dealer in agricultural products%}, something like {%truck-farmer%}; possibly <ab>cf.</ab> ogara, oggara, cited by <ls>Sheth</ls> from Prākṛta-piṅgala as meaning {%a king of grain%} or {%rice%}. Certainly not a keeper of a shop in the country, for the story shows that it means a member of an urban tradesmanʼs guild, parallel with perfumers: <ls>Av</ls> 〔i.198.7〕 pitā te okkarika āsīd; 〔10〕 [Page158-1b] tenaukkarikāpaṇo vyavasthāpitaḥ; 〔12〕 tenaukkarika-tvaṃ tyaktvā. The story is the same as that in which <ls>Divy</ls> uses {@aukarika@}. I see no reason to associate with either of these words the <ab>n. pr.</ab> {@Utkarika@} or {@Otk°@}, <ab>qq.v.</ab>
