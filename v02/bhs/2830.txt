[? {@āmukta@}¦, <lex>ppp.</lex>, <lex>f.</lex> {@°tā@}, <ab>acc.</ab> to <ls>Divy</ls> 〔Index〕 {%jewel%}, in <ls>Divy</ls> 〔2.28〕 (ratnapratyuptikayā) karṇikayā āmuktayālaṃkṛtaḥ; 〔3.7〕 koṭimūlyayā ratnapratyuptikayā āmuktayā jātaḥ; and see {@āmuktaka, °ikā@}. I doubt this <ab>mg.</ab>; in 〔2.28〕 it seems a normal <lex>ppp.</lex> = <lang>Skt.</lang> āmukta, °ā: {%adorned with a jewel-set earring fastened on him%} (<ab>cf.</ab> also <ls>Divy</ls> 〔614.17〕 āmuktamālyābharaṇā, {%with garlands and ornaments fastened on%}); this is a regular <ab>mg.</ab> of āmuñcati. In 〔3.7〕, to be sure, no noun is expressed; the same karṇikā of 〔2.28〕 is however clearly meant; possibly here ratna-pratyuptikayā may be understood as a <lex>subst.</lex>, with specifying ka (〔§ 22.39〕): {%with a jewel-studded thing fastened on%}.]
