<L>5701<pc>211,1<k1>gahana<k2>gahana
{@gahana@}¦ (<lex>nt.</lex>, or <lex>adj.</lex>), is sometimes, apparently, involved in word-plays with {@grahaṇa@}, <ab>q.v.</ab> (on the basis of <lang>MIndic</lang> pronunciation of the latter). In <ls>Śikṣ</ls> 〔286.1〕 (aśaṭhatā śaṭheṣu,) amāyāvitā gahanacariteṣu (this is the clear intention of the <ab>ms.</ab>, see <ab>ed.</ab> note, and must be read), kṛtajñatā akṛtajñeṣu, <ab>etc.</ab>, the <lang>Tib.</lang> is said to render {%guilelessness among the guileful%}, which is supported by the parallel phrases surrounding this. The <ls>transl. of Bendall and Rouse</ls> renders gahana-carita {%overreaching%}; it seems more likely to mean {%of obscure, hidden%} (or perhaps {%tangled%}) {%conduct%}, and so {%tricky%}. See next (apparently a quite unrelated confusion).
