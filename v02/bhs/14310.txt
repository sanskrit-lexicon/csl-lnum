? {@visāriṇī@}¦, in <ls>Divy</ls> 〔562.23〕 (prose) sa tābhyāṃ yāvat trir apy ukto visāriṇī kṛṣṇā nivāryamāṇā (so text, <ab>em.</ab>, <ab>mss.</ab> °ṇau, intending °ṇo, which read) nāvatiṣṭhate, {%he%} (the king), {%<ab>tho</ab> spoken to%} (in admonition) {%by those two%} (ministers) {%as many as three times, being held back … did not remain%} (in good conduct; he kept backsliding into evil ways). The words visāriṇī kṛṣṇā perhaps corruptly represent an <lex>abl.</lex> phrase, {%from his evil course%} (<ab>cf.</ab> {@kṛṣṇa@} 1). As they stand, they could apparently only be a strange parenthetical clause; {%the corruption%} (? visāriṇī, or viśār° ?) {%was black (dark, evil)%}. The Index to <ab>ed.</ab> renders kṛṣṇā by {%tongue of fire%}, which seems unacceptable; presumably it takes visā° as {%spreading%}; but even with the <ab>em.</ab> to nivāryamāṇā this hardly gives an intelligible result.
