{@lokākhyāna-kathā@}¦, <ls>Divy</ls> 〔304.27〕, and {@lokākhyāyikā@}, 26, 29, {%story-telling about the world%}. Here a workman tells entertaining stories to his fellow workmen. Certainly not {%philosophical discussion about%} (the creation, <ab>etc.</ab>, of) {%the world%}, which is the scholastic interpretation of <lang>Pali</lang> lokakkhāyikā (<ab>e.g.</ab> <ls>DN comm.</ls> 〔i.90.32〕; <ls>MN comm.</ls> 〔iii.223.15〕), adopted in <ls>PTSD</ls>. I am not sure that this is not late commentarial pedantry; in the canonical and other early <lang>Pali</lang> texts, so far as I can see, the <lang>Pali</lang> word might have the <ab>mg.</ab> which it clearly has in <ls>Divy</ls>.
