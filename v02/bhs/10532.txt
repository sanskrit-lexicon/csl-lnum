? {@praviśāmayati@}¦, perhaps {%stills, causes to subside%}: smṛtim upasthāpayati (<ab>q.v.</ab> 2) praviśāmayati <ls>Divy</ls> 〔542.22〕; seems to be opposite (or, perhaps, equivalent?) of upasthāp°, but I do not understand the passage; Index leaves praviś° untranslated; context seems to throw no light on it. <ab>Cf.</ab> {@pratiśāmayati@}, which however does not seem to fit in this place.
