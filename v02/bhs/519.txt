{@adhvānīya@}¦ (better adhvaniya; <lang>Pali</lang> addhaniya), {%fit for a journey%}: some such form seems clearly intended by <ab>mss.</ab> at <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.93.19〕; they read (nātyātiśītaṃ nātyātiuṣṇaṃ) ṛtusukhaṃ adhvānīyaṃ (<ab>v.l.</ab> adhyā°) taṃ bhagavantaṃ (read bhavantaṃ, or bhadanta, <ab>m.c.</ab>; object of paśyantu, next line, or <lex>voc.</lex>). They are clearly corrupt, but <ls>Senart</ls>ʼs emendations are proved wrong by the <lang>Pali</lang> parallel <ls>Therag.</ls> 〔529〕; divide ṛtu (ṛtuṃ? ṛtū?) sukhaṃ, {%the season is pleasant and fit for travel%}.
