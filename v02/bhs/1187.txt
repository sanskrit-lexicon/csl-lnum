{@andhakārāpita-tva@}¦, <lex>nt.</lex> (<ab>abstr.</ab> from <lex>caus.</lex> <lex>pple.</lex> to <lex>denom.</lex> verb from andhakāra, {%darkness%}), {%state of being darkened%}; so (or, possibly, andhakārāyita-tva, from non-<lex>caus.</lex> <lex>denom.</lex> <lex>pple.</lex>) I would read at <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.41.5〕; 〔229.20〕; 〔240.9〕; 〔ii.162.9〕; 〔iii.334.7〕; 〔341.12〕. The <ab>mss.</ab> are corrupt in the entire passage (see {@lokāntarikā@}) and particularly at this point; <ls>Senart</ls> reads °kārārpitā, but there is no support for the -r- in the <ab>mss.</ab> The <ls>Mv</ls> seems to have read andhakārā andhakārāpitatvā (? °yitatvā), tamisrā {@tamisrāyitatvā@} (<ab>q.v.</ab>), {%darknesses, darkenednesses, glooms, begloomednesses%}. Only <ls>Mv</ls> has the second member of each pair (the derivatives of <lex>denom.</lex> <lex>pples.</lex>); the other parallel passages point to something like andhakārā {@andhakāratamisrāḥ@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>
