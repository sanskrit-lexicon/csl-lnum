[? {@jāhu@}¦, in <ls>RP</ls> 〔58.18〕 (<ab>vs</ab>), printed: dūre jāhu bhujagavad etān (<ab>sc.</ab> evil companions). Since it is scarcely possible that the <lang>Vedic</lang> verb aj-, {%drive%} (away), is concerned ('jā = aja, hu = khalu, {%drive them away like serpents!%}), I believe that some form of hā, {%abandon%} (less likely of han, {%smite%}) must be involved; the ā might well be <ab>m.c.</ab> (meter requires two long syllables), but I cannot explain the final u (ū ?). Perhaps read jāhā = jaha, 2 <ab>sg.</ab> <lex>impv.</lex>, {%abandon!%} (?)]
