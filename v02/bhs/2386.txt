? {@asaṃkhyaya@}¦, <lex>adj.</lex>, {%innumerable%}, occurs repeatedly (instead of regular asaṃkhyeya) in <ab>mss.</ab> of <ls>LV</ls>, and is sometimes adopted by <ls>Lefm.</ls> in the text: 〔86.15〕 (<ab>vv.ll.</ab> asaṃkhya, asaṃkhyeya); 〔112.4〕 (with most <ab>mss.</ab>, <ab>v.l.</ab> °khyeya). <ls>Weller</ls> 〔23〕 would read asaṃkhyeya always, perhaps rightly; but the frequent occurrence of °khyaya in the <ab>mss.</ab> is strange. Like <ls>Weller</ls> I am unable to understand the long ā in asaṃkhyayā-kalpakoṭi- 〔86.15〕; probably read °ya- as in 〔112.4〕. <lex>Instr.</lex> of a-saṃkhyā unlikely.
