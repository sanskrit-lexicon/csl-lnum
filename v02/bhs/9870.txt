{@pracārika@}¦, <lex>m.</lex> or <lex>nt.</lex>, {@°kā@}, <lex>f.</lex>, in pāda-pra°, {%journey on foot%}: <ls>Mmk</ls> 〔694.3—4〕, ūṣmāyamāne pādapracārikaṃ pañcayojanaśatāni gacchati, sarve cāsya pādapracārikā vaśyā bhavanti, {%if it steams%}, (it augurs that) {%he is going a journey of 500 yojanas on foot, and all foot-journeys come under his control%}; but the <ab>mg.</ab> in the next two is obscure to me: ūṣmāyamāne (as above!) pādapracārikāṃ (so!) pañcavarṣasahasrāyur bhavati <ls>Mmk</ls> 〔713.17〕, and: pādapracārike (! <lex>loc.</lex> <ab>sg.</ab>?) saptavarṣsahasrāṇi jīvati 〔718.8—9〕; in both of these it seems that omens of very long life are inferred, in the first depending on {%steaming%} of the offering; [Page357-b] the word pādapra° is obscure in application; perhaps read °rikāyāṃ for °rikāṃ in 〔713.17〕, and render both words {%in case of%} (his making) {%a foot-journey?%}
