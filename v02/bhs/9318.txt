? {@palīkṛta@}¦, in <ls>Av</ls> 〔ii.136.10〕 (<ab>vs</ab>) ādīptaṃ kānanaṃ sarvaṃ parvatā pi °kṛtā, <ab>perh.</ab> {%even the mountains are made into straws%} (pala, <lang>Skt.</lang> <ab>Lex.</ab>, {%straw%}). <ls>Speyer</ls>, {%a-glowing%}, with little if any support, and evidently thinking the word must have a <ab>mg.</ab> similar to ādīptaṃ; but this is quite unnecessary; two entirely separate situations are referred to, related only in that they are things hard to conceive as accomplished. <ls>Speyer</ls> cites <lang>Tib.</lang> as <tib>ser bo</tib>, which he identifies with <tib>ser po</tib>, {%yellow%}; this, even if justified, does not give the meaning he assumes.
