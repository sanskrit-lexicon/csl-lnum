{@gahanatā@}¦ (<ab>app.</ab> = <lang>Pali</lang> gahaṇa, below; <ab>cf.</ab> <ab>prec.</ab>), designates some sort of heresy: <ls>Śikṣ</ls> 〔172.3〕 (prose) idam agraṃ mithyādṛṣṭīnāṃ, yad uta gahanatā-dṛṣṭiḥ. <ab>Ed.</ab> note refers to <ls>Dhp. comm.</ls> 〔iii.494.1〕 (on <ls>Dhp.</ls> 〔318〕 micchādiṭṭhisamādānā) gahaṇa-saṃkhātāya micchādiṭṭhiyā samādinnattā, {%from being taken by the heresy called gahaṇa%}; the domal ṇ suggests connexion with <lang>Skt.</lang> and <lang>BHS</lang> {@grahaṇa@}, which <ls>Bendall</ls> says is also shown by the <lang>Tib.</lang> rendering, which he quotes as <tib>gziṅs pa</tib> (connecting it with <tib>ḥdzin pa</tib>). The <ls>Dhp.</ls> context suggests that it consists in taking what is sinful for no sin, and <lat>vice versa</lat>; <ab>perh.</ab> then <ab>lit.</ab> {%holding%} (perverse views on morals)? Unfortunately I find no other evidence for the heresy referred to, in either <lang>Pali</lang> or <lang>BHS</lang>. <ls>Bendall and Rouse</ls>: {%the chiefest of all false doctrine, that is, the heresy of clinging to the world%} (would this be called a {%false doctrine%}, dṛṣṭi?).
