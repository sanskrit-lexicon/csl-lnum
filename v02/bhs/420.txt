{@adhitiṣṭhati@}¦, also {@adhiṣṭhahati, °ṣṭhihati@} (and noun {@adhiṣṭhāna@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>; <lang>Pali</lang> adhitiṭṭhati, adhiṭṭhāna, in general in same meanings; previous translations of <lang>BHS</lang> vary widely and are hardly worth systematic quotation; very common is {%bless%}, which I think should be deleted, see below): ({@1@}) {%masters, controls%}, in normal <lang>Skt.</lang> (<ls>BR</ls> sthā with adhi 3, 4) and also <lang>BHS</lang> (<ab>exx.</ab> <ls>LaVallée Poussin, AbhidhK.</ls> 〔vii.119 note 2, b〕); in <lang>BHS</lang> particularly {%takes possession%} or {%control of%}, <ls>MSV</ls> 〔i.248.20〕 (sāptāhikaṃ), and <ab>ff.</ab>; <ls>Bhīk</ls> 〔15a.1〕 (the newly initiated nun says to her instructress) samanvāhara upādhyāyike, aham … idaṃ cīvaraṃ saṃghāṭīm adhitiṣṭhāmi, {%I take%} (formal) {%possession of my nunʼs garments%} (similarly with other implements, below: <ls>Ridding</ls> 〔p. 124〕 calls this rite {%benediction%} of the garments, <ab>etc.</ab>; but the nun is the only speaker; she would not ‘bless’ her own belongings!); in <lang>BHS</lang> ({@2@}) the power or control is usually {%supernatural%} or {%magical%}: adhitiṣṭhantu buddhā bhagavanto idaṃ paṭasūtram <ls>Mmk</ls> 〔56.12〕, {%let the Lord Buddhas exercize their supernatural power over%} (assume control of) {%this thread%} (<ls>Lalou, Iconographie</ls> 〔p. 20〕, {%<fr>occupent</fr>%}); in the sequel, favorable sounds show the performer that, adhiṣṭhitaṃ me buddhair … tat paṭasūtraṃ (17); he reflects, buddhānāṃ … adhiṣṭhānam etat (24), {%this is the controlling power of the <ab>B.</ab>%}; <ls>Laṅk</ls> 〔100.6 ff.〕 [Page013-a], Bodhisattvas may be adhiṣṭhānadvayādhiṣṭhitāḥ, {%controlled by two supernatural powers%} (of Buddhas, <ab>cf.</ab> 11 buddhādhiṣṭhānādhiṣṭhitāḥ); these are (9) samādhisamāpattyadhiṣṭhāna; {%the control that gives attainment of samādhis%} (<ab>cf.</ab> 12 samādhiṃ samāpadyante; to this verb {@samāpatti@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>, is merely a noun of action; wrongly <ls>Suzuki</ls>), and sarvakāyamukhapāṇyabhiṣekādhiṣṭhāna, {%the control that comes from sprinkling by%} (the Buddhaʼs) {%hands of the whole body and face%} (<ab>cf.</ab> 〔101.10—11〕);

this {%control%} often involves ({@3@}) {%magic transformation%}, and even the {%creation of magic appearances%}; not easily separated from the preceding; transitional is sarvabuddhādhiṣṭhito 'yaṃ … dharmaparyāyaḥ <ls>SP</ls> 〔288.13〕, {%it is under the supernatural control of all the Buddhas%} (hence marvelous effects for one who preaches it, as related above), with this <ab>cf.</ab> tasmāt tarhi … adhitiṣṭhāmīmaṃ dharmaparyāyaṃ asmiñ jambudvīpe <ls>SP</ls> 〔421.2〕, {%therefore I%} (<ab>lit.</ab> {%exercize supernatural power over this <ab n="Dharmaparyāya">Dh.</ab>%}, which however here seems to mean) {%make this <ab n="Dharmaparyāya">Dh.</ab> appear in this <ab n="Jambudvīpa">J.</ab>%} (with magical effects, some mentioned above, some in the next sentence); from such passages as this and <ls>SP</ls> 〔384.3〕, below, <ls>LaVallée Poussin, AbhidhK.</ls>, 〔Index〕, and <ab>esp.</ab> 〔vii.119, note 2〕, derives the supposed meaning {%<fr>faire durer</fr>%}, but in 〔iii.31〕, note 2, quoting the vyākhyā, he translates adhitiṣṭhati {%<fr>bénit</fr>%}, whereas it means {%takes under control, assumes control of%}; the meaning {%bless%}, assumed by <ls>Burnouf</ls> and many others, rests on <lang>Tib.</lang> <tib>byin kyi rlabs</tib>, which to be sure often means {%bless%}, but <ab>acc.</ab> to <ls>Jäschke</ls> also {%create, change into%}; this kind of change by magical mastery or control need not be a {%blessing%}, <ab>cf.</ab> (tā jarājarjarā) adhyatiṣṭhat <ls>LV</ls> 〔378.17〕, {%he changed them%} (the daughters of Māra, by magic control) {%so as to be decrepit with age%}, and later, buddhasya yo hy adhiṣṭhānaṃ śaknuyāt kartum anyathā 〔379.3〕, (I see no one) {%who could alter a magic transformation of the Buddha%};
