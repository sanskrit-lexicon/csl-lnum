({@vaṃśarāga@}¦, {%bamboo-colored%}, <lex>adj.</lex> applied to a kind of vaiḍūrya-gem in <ls>Kauṭ. Arth., Shama-S.¹</ls> 〔76.19〕; so also <ls>Jm</ls> 〔92.2〕 vaṃśarāga-vaiḍūrya-prabhā-vyatikara-harita-salilam; in line 4 (<ab>vs</ab>) the same is described as marakataharita-prabhair jalair …, which misled <ls>Speyer</ls> into taking va° as a synonym of marakata, {%emerald%}; but it is clear from <ls>Kauṭ.</ls> that it is another green gem.)
