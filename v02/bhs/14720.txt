<L>14720<pc>519,1<k1>vyAskandaka<k2>vyAskandaka-
{@vyāskandaka-@}¦, a kind of {@samāpatti@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>: <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔1497〕 (<ls>Mironov</ls> {@vya°@}). <lang>Tib.</lang> renders by <tib>snrel zhi</tib>, which usually = {@vyatyasta@} (<ab>q.v.</ab> 2), and <ls>Mvy</ls> <ab>ed.</ab> suggests reading so; <ab>cf.</ab> {@vyutkrāntaka@}. It would seem to be, like the latter, a manner of skipping from one trance-state to a non-adjoining one. But <lang>Chin.</lang> has the equivalent of nāsaṃjñāyatana, which as <ls>Ting</ls> says seems ‘an abbreviation’ (the last part) of {@naivasaṃjñānāsaṃjñāyatana@}.
