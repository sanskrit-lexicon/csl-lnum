{@vilekhya@}¦, <lex>m.</lex>, <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔5235〕 °yaḥ, defined in <lang>Tib.</lang> and <lang>Chin.</lang> as {%regret%} or {%impressing on the mind, paying careful heed%}; same definition for {@ālekhya@} (or {@°kha@}), {@vipratisāra@}, and {@kaukṛtya@}, 〔5234, 5236, 5237〕. Obviously related to {@vilekha@}, which is recorded as <ab>v.l.</ab> in both <ab>edd.</ab> of <ls>Mvy</ls> and should perhaps be read for this.
