{@abhijñā@}¦ (= <lang>Pali</lang> abhiññā), {%higher or supernatural knowledge; intuition%} (<ls>CPD</ls>). There are 5 or 6, in both <lang>Pali</lang> and <lang>BHS</lang>, agreeing in essence <ab>tho</ab> the order and precise forms of the names vary. In <ls>Dharmas</ls> 〔20〕, five: divyacakṣus, divyaśrotra, paracittajñāna, pūrvanivāsānusmṛti, ṛddhi; in <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔201—209〕 six, same order, with variant forms, (parasya) {@cetaḥ-@} (citta-)-{@paryāya-@} (<ab>q.v.</ab>)-jñāna, for the third; the sixth is āśravakṣayajñāna, as in <lang>Pali</lang> and elsewhere when 6 are named; the fifth is ṛddhividhijñāna in <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔208〕; <ls>SP</ls> 〔134.11〕 lists 5, practically as in <ls>Dharmas</ls> except that the fifth is ṛddhivimokṣakriyā, an unusual phrase, for which no <ab>v.l.</ab> is given in <ls>KN</ls> or <ls>WT</ls>; <ls>Burnouf</ls> (<ls>Lotus</ls> 〔App. XIV, p. 821〕) cites his <ab>ms.</ab> as reading ṛddhisākṣātkriyā, which is much more plausible. Twenty abhijñā-karmāṇi are set forth in detail <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔210—230〕. In <ls>Laṅk</ls> 〔292.13—16〕 the abhijñā, collectively, are classified as to their origin in four ways (in <ab>l.</ab> 16 read with <ls>Suzuki Transl.</ls> 〔242 n. 1〕 te 'bhijñā na vipākajāḥ). References to {%five%} abhijñā: <ls>SP</ls> 〔12.4〕; 〔141.9〕; 〔254.14〕; <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.284.3〕; 〔ii.33.11〕; in 〔ii.96.1〕 attributed to brahmanical, non-Buddhist {%ṛṣis%}; <ls>Divy</ls> 〔321.3〕; <ls>Śikṣ</ls> 〔243.13〕 (read pañco, see 〔p. 412, note〕) <ab>etc.</ab>; {%six%}, <ls>SP</ls> 〔90.7〕; 〔129.10〕; 〔150.2〕; 〔155.2〕; 〔255.4〕; 〔272.6〕; <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.55.5 ff.〕; <ls>Divy</ls> 〔399.27〕, <ab>etc.</ab>; note <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.165.12〕 where ‘by abhijñā’ (abhijñāye) the Buddha attains knowledge of the Doctrine taught of old by other Buddhas; this certainly does not mean {%memory%}, <ab>cf.</ab> <ab>s.v.</ab> {@abhijānāti@}, which is commonly but wrongly rendered {%remembers%} in similar contexts; mahābhijñā- <ls>SP</ls> 〔66.8〕.
