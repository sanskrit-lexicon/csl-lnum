{@ṣaḍvārgika@}¦, <lex>m.</lex> <ab>pl.</ab> (= <ab>prec.</ab> two and <lang>Pali</lang> chabbaggiya), {%members of the group of six (monks)%}, see <ls>Childers</ls> and <ls>PTSD</ls>: <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔9255〕 = <lang>Tib.</lang> <tib>drug sde</tib>. Their names are given 〔9471—6〕: Nanda, Upananda, Punarvasu, Chanda, Aśvaka, Udāyin; the <lang>Pali</lang> list agrees only in part. Nanda and Upananda also belong to this group in <ls>Divy</ls>; see <ab>s.v.</ab> {@Nandopananda@}. In <lang>Pali</lang> they seem to be represented as followers of the Buddha, though very imperfect ones, often transgressing rules of propriety. In <lang>BHS</lang>, at least in <ls>Divy</ls>, they seem to be heretics from the Buddhist standpoint.
