{@kuśalapuṇya@}¦, {%meritorious deed of virtue%}, in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.81.1—2〕 contrasted with kuśalamūla, but whether the former marks a higher, more developed stage of religious advancement than the latter (as <ls>Senart</ls> seems to believe), is not clear to me: (ye punar …) bodhisattvā avaivartikatāyai pariṇāmenti, kin tu khalu teṣām upacita-kuśalapuṇyānāṃ prathamā praṇidhir utpadyati, āho svid upacita-kuśalamūlānām iti. The reply, in <ab>vss</ab>, first says that worship of Buddhas <ab>etc.</ab> does not suffice. Then (〔81.16〕) te yadā vipula-puṇya-saṃcayā, bhonti bhāvita-śarīramānasāḥ; te … bodhaye upajanenti mānasaṃ; yaṃ mayā kuśalamūlam arjitaṃ, tena me bhavatu sarvadarśitā; … (〔82.3〕) yaś ca me kuśalamūla-saṃcayo, so mahā bhavatu sarvaprāṇibhiḥ … Is puṇya of 〔81.16〕 something else than kuśala-puṇya of 〔81.1—2〕? Both it and kuśala-mūla seem, as far as I can tell, to have the same effect in the verses; no clear answer to the question in the prose has been discovered by me.
