{@anyatra@}¦, <lex>adv.</lex>, ({@1@}) {%on the contrary%} (this <ab>mg.</ab> seems exclusively peculiar to <lang>BHS</lang>); always after negative expressions: <ls>SP</ls> 〔73.10〕 anyatra tena tenaiva dhāvanti, (they pay no attention and do not understand;) {%on the contrary, they run this way and that%}; 〔102.9〕 na kasyacid ācakṣed anyatraika evātmanādhyātmaṃ saṃtapyed, {%he would not speak of it to anyone; on the contrary, he would all alone be grieving himself by himself%}; 〔284.9〕; 〔378.4〕; <ls>LV</ls> 〔71.6〕 (Māyā felt no heaviness of body, gurukāyatāṃ;) anyatra laghutām eva, {%on the contrary, nothing but lightness%}; 〔259.16〕; 〔260.8〕; 〔268.15〕; <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.66.8〕 and 15 (there is no soul nor anything resembling a soul;) atha evaṃ anyatra karma caiva karmavipākaṃ ca hetuś (first time, hetuṃ) caiva hetusamutpannā ca dharmā(ḥ), {%but rather, on the contrary, only action%} <ab>etc.</ab> (see under {@atha@}); <ls>Laṅk</ls> 〔9.7〕 (see <ab>s.v.</ab> {@vikalpa@}; wrongly <ls>Suzuki</ls>); 〔39.7〕 anyatra kāraṇataḥ, {%on the contrary, from a cause%} (wrongly <ls>Suzuki</ls>); 〔119.6〕 (place daṇḍa between evam and anyatra); 〔152.1〕; <ls>RP</ls> 〔42.4〕; <ls>Samādh</ls> 〔22.39〕 [Page041-b] (wrongly <ls>Régamey</ls>); <ls>Śikṣ</ls> 〔147.3〕 (and several times in <ls>Śikṣ</ls> followed by {@yāvad eva@}, {%just simply%}, <ab>q.v.</ab>); the negative may be repeated just before anyatra, but only as resuming the <ab>neg.</ab> of the preceding clause, not negating the clause containing anyatra: <ls>Bbh</ls> 〔121.(19—)21〕 (a Bodhisattva does not give a petitioner the trouble of asking repeatedly before he gives him a gift;) nānyatra yācitamātra eva, {%no; on the contrary%}, (he gives) {%the very moment he is asked%}; ({@2@}) {%except%}; in <lang>Skt.</lang> and <lang>Pali</lang> hardly used except as preposition (with <lex>abl.</lex> in <lang>Skt.</lang>, <lang>Pali</lang> aññatra also with <lex>instr.</lex> and <lex>gen.</lex>); in <lang>Skt.</lang> very rarely as adverb, the noun being construed with other words in the sentence (see <ls>BR</ls> 〔1.266〕 and <ls>pw</ls> 〔3.251〕). In <lang>BHS</lang> I have noted a single case, not wholly certain, of anyatra as preposition with <lex>instr.</lex> (as in <lang>Pali</lang>, instead of <lex>abl.</lex> as in <lang>Skt.</lang>): <ls>RP</ls> 〔40.4〕 rātriṃdivaṃ bhavantībhir nānyā kathā kāryā, anyatra nṛttagītavāditena, {%you are to say nothing else, except dance, song, and instrumental music%} (?). But the adverbial use in this <ab>mg.</ab>, so rare in <lang>Skt.</lang> and not recorded for <lang>Pali</lang>, is well established in <lang>BHS</lang>; in the following cases the form and construction of other words in the clause is totally unaffected by anyatra; often it may be translated as if it were a conjunction, {%except that …%} It almost always follows a negative expression (or interrogative, rhetorically equivalent to <ab>neg.</ab>); and this is sometimes resumed by an additional na before anyatra (as in the last case under 1, above): <ls>Divy</ls> 〔6.28〕 sārthaṃ na paśyati nānyatra gardabhayānam eva, {%he didnʼt see the caravan, not except only a donkey-cart%}; and with anyatra as quasi-conjunction, <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.90.14—15〕 nāsti anyo upāyo nānyatra etaṃ samudraṃ utsicāmi, {%there is no other means, not%} (any) {%except%} (that) {%I bale out%} (exhaust) {%this sea%}. In the next the na before anyatra goes with the main verb (or rather <lex>ppp.</lex>): <ls>SP</ls> 〔318.4〕 nānyatra sattvānāṃ paripācanārtham avatāraṇārtham ete dharmaparyāyā bhāṣitāḥ, {%these dharmaparyāya are not spoken except%} (<ab>i.e.</ab> are spoken only) {%to mature creatures and make them arrive at comprehension%}.
