[{@yāt@}¦, <ls>Lefm.</ls> in <ls>LV</ls> 〔62.12〕 (prose), evidently supposed to mean {%since%} (<lang>Vedic</lang> yāt, assumed by <ls>Pischel</ls> 〔427〕 as base for <lang>Pkt.</lang> jā, which others derive from <lang>Skt.</lang> yāvat). But no <ab>ms.</ab> reads yāt; some yā, others omit the word (<ab>prob.</ab> with <ab>orig.</ab> text) or have other variants. Such a <ab>Pktism</ab>, and a dubious one at that, can hardly be assumed in the prose of <ls>LV</ls>.]
