{@Maitrīya@}¦, in <ls>Kv</ls> 〔2.2〕 the last of a rather short list of Bodhisattvas; we should expect the name of {@Maitreya@} (1) here, and probably the text has a mere error or misprint for it. More curious however is <ls>Divy</ls> 〔326.9—11〕 eṣa eva devate sa (separate from the next) pṛṣṭhībhūto Maitrīyo yo vyāghryā ātmānaṃ parityajya catvāriṃśatkalpasaṃprasthito Maitreyo bodhisattva ekena śiraḥparityāgenāvapṛṣṭhīkṛtaḥ; here, if the text is correct, Maitrīya would seem to be the name of Maitreya in an earlier birth; but the passage is otherwise puzzling. On the basis of these two passages should we recognize Maitrīya as a real variant (like {@Maitraka@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>) for {@Maitreya@} (1)?
