Does {%this adhiṣṭhāna%} mean {%this exhibition of supernatural power%}, <ab>viz</ab>, the making of the stūpa to appear? Or is it {%this fixed determination, resolution%} (2, above)? Near synonyms are {@āveśa@}, (<lang>Skt.</lang>) anubhāva, {@adhimukti@}; <ab>cf.</ab> also <ls>Laṅk</ls> 〔292.13〕 and 15, where one of the sources of abhijñā is ‘from adhiṣṭhāna’ (adhiṣṭhānān, so read in 13 for text °nāṃ, <lex>abl.</lex>, before n-), which means {%from the controlling power of the Buddhas%} and is paraphrased in 15 by buddhaprasādataḥ, {%from the grace of the Buddhas%}. <ls>Suzuki, Transl. of Laṅk</ls> <lat><ab>passim</ab></lat>, renders {%sustaining power%}; I think rather {%controlling power%}. Even Bodhisattvas are at times dependent on Buddhas and need their control; ({@4@}) in architecture, <lang>Skt.</lang> (see <ls>Acharya, Dict. Hindu Arch.</ls> <ab>s.v.</ab>), {%basement, foundation%} of building or {%base%} of a pillar. Here in <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔5591〕 = <lang>Tib.</lang> <tib>lan kan gyi rten ma</tib>, {%prop%} (<ab>i.e.</ab> base) {%of a railing%}; so <lang>Chin.</lang> Whatever it means here is certainly meant also in <ls>Divy</ls> 〔221.9, 10〕 adhiṣṭhānam, and <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.195.1 ff.〕; 〔iii.227.8 ff.〕, adhiṣṭhānakam, where the context is the same as in <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔5591〕; see {@sūcī, sūcikā@}; ({@5@}) see {@pādādhiṣṭhāna@}; ({@6@}) <lex>m.</lex>, <ab>n.</ab> of a (mythical) samādhi: <ls>Gv</ls> 〔451.26〕. In this curious passage, 〔451.25—452.6〕, the word adhiṣṭhāna is further used predicatively in a series of equational sentences, varying in gender like an adjective [Page016-b] with different subjects. Bhadrottamā says to Sudhana: ahaṃ kulaputrā 'nālayamaṇḍalaṃ nāma dharmaparyāyaṃ jānāmi deśayāmy, adhiṣṭhānaś ca me samādhiḥ pratilabdho; na tatra samādhau kasyacid dharmasyā 'dhiṣṭhānam; adhiṣṭhānaṃ tatra sarvajñatācakṣuḥ pravartate, 'dhiṣṭhānaṃ sarvajñatāśrotram, adhiṣṭhānaṃ sarvajñatāghrāṇam, adhiṣṭhānā sarvajñatājihvā, 'dhiṣṭhānaḥ sarvajñatākāyo, 'dhiṣṭhānaṃ tatra sarvajñatāmanaḥ pravartate, 'dhiṣṭhānā sarvajñatormir, adhiṣṭhānā sarvajñatāvidyud, adhiṣṭhānāḥ sarvajñatāvegāḥ pravartante jagadrocanāmaṇḍalāḥ; etam ahaṃ kulaputrā 'nālayamaṇḍalaṃ dharmaparyāyaṃ jānāmi. (Punctuation introduced by me.) There is no further light from the context. I am not sure what meaning the author attributed to the word adhiṣṭhāna: presumably something like either {%basis%} or {%controlling power%}.
