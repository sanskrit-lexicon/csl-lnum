{@aprati-varṇanīya@}¦, in <ls>LV</ls> 〔411.10〕, {%incomparably worthy of praise%}, in a list of complimentary epithets of sounds (śabda), after nirvarṇanīya, {%praiseworthy%}. I believe that aprati- must be recognized as used in <lang>Skt.</lang> as prior element in <ab>cpds.</ab> in this sense, as <ab>e.g.</ab> in aprati-cakra (<ls>pw</ls>) and aprati-karman (commonly analyzed as a-pratikarman; but there is no record of any *pratikarman in the sense of {%a corresponding action%}, and the immediate constituents seem to me clearly aprati and karman). <lang>Tib.</lang> <tib>zla med pa</tib>, {%matchless%}, for aprati.
