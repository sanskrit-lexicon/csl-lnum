{@dhuta-dharma@}¦, <lex>m.</lex> <ab>pl.</ab> (= {@dhuta, °guṇa, dhūtaguṇa@}: <ab>cf.</ab> <lang>Pali</lang> dhammaṃ dhutaṃ <ls>Sn</ls> 〔385〕, but the sequel shows that this is not used in the technical sense of <lang>Pali</lang> dhutaṅga; it is very vague and general; <ls>Childers</ls> cites a dhūta-dhamma but his references fail to show it), {%the qualities of the purified man%}: °māḥ <ls>RP</ls> 〔33.1〕 (<ab>vs</ab>); the disciple Kāśyapa is regularly called dhutadharma-dhara, {%maintainer of the …%}, <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.85.11 ff.〕; 〔105.12, 13〕, or the like, as °rma-dhārin <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.66.16〕; °rma-samaṅgin (see {@samaṅgin@}) 〔i.71.16〕; in 〔i.69.13〕 (<ab>vs</ab>) <ls>Senart</ls> reads evam ukte dhutadharmaviśuddho (Kāśyapo …), <ab>mss.</ab> °rma-su-viśuddhaṃ; the syllable su is hypermetric, but the <lex>acc.</lex> °dhaṃ (<ab>tho</ab> certainly referring to <ab n="Kāśyapa">K.</ab>) could perhaps stand as goal of ukte, {%it having been thus spoken to the one-that-was-purified-in-the-dhutadharma, <ab n="Kāśyapa">K.</ab>%} (replied); Kāśyapa has similar epithets involving dhutaguṇa (dhū°), a fact which establishes their equivalence of <ab>mg.</ab> with dhutadharma; and see also {@dhutadhara@}.
