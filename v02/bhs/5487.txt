[? {@khalli(n)@}¦, obscure and corrupt: <ls>SP</ls> 〔351.5〕 (<ab>vs</ab>) so dṛṣṭva teṣāṃ ca jarām upasthitāṃ, valī ca khallī (so <ls>KN</ls> <ab>em.</ab>, <ab>mss.</ab> khalī, <ab>unmetr.</ab>; <ls>WT</ls> khaṇḍaṃ with their <ab>ms.</ab> <ms>Ḱ</ms>) ca śiraś ca pāṇḍaram, {%seeing … their wrinkles … and gray head(s)%}. <lang>Tib.</lang> seems to have no equivalent of the crucial word: <tib>mgo la skra dkar gñer ma kun byuṅ ste</tib>, {%(them) having become all with white hair on the head and wrinkles%}. A noun seems to be required for this word; if khaṇḍaṃ is the true reading, perhaps it could mean something like {%decrepitude%}.]
