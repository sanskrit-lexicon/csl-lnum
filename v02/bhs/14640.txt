{@vyapatrāpya@}¦, <lex>nt.</lex> (as <ab>prec.</ab>; <ab>cf.</ab> {@apatrāpya@}), {%shame, modesty, bashfulness%}: lajjā-°pya-saṃlīna-cetās <ls>Divy</ls> 〔255.16〕, hrī-°pya-gṛhītā 23 (here the bashfulness of love); {%shame%} of an evil deed, (śikṣāvyatikrame) °pyam utpadyate <ls>Bbh</ls> 〔137.20〕; in this sense in <ab>cpd.</ab> hrī-°pya, °pyaṃ prāviṣkaroti <ls>Bbh</ls> 〔6.1〕; similarly 〔137.25 f.〕; 〔159.14〕; 〔180.2〕; 〔250.8〕 (katamad bodhisattvānāṃ hrī-vyapatrāpyaṃ); a distinction between hrī and vyapa° is made in <ls>Bbh</ls> 〔250.10—12〕, where both are glossed lajjā, but hrī is said to mean the feeling that a blameworthy act is unworthy of oneself, vyapatrāpya is the feeling caused thereby <ab>thru</ab> fear or respect of others. Is this anything more than a commentatorʼs ad-hoc attempt at subtlety ? In <ls>AbhidhK. LaV-P.</ls> 〔ii.172〕 hrī is defined in a way suggesting rather vyapatrāpya of <ls>Bbh</ls>.
