{@jitam@}¦, apparently <lex>interj.</lex> or particle, chiefly in phrase: api hi jitaṃ <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.126.9〕; 〔iii.181.14〕; 〔206.10, 12〕; 〔209.12〕; this seems to be an expression of {%astonishment%}, something like {%Whoʼd have thought it? That beats all!%} Once, in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.286.1〕, jitaṃ (<ab>v.l.</ab> jidaṃ) occurs by itself; the daughters of Māra, reporting to Māra, say: (any other man than the Bodhisattva, seeing us,) so jitaṃ mūrchitvā prapatiṣyad vā … cittakṣayaṃ vā prāpuṇe (but the <ab n="Bodhisattva">B.</ab> was unmoved); here too {%astonishment%} might be the connotation of the particle; {%he, good heavens! would have fallen down fainting …, or lost his wits%}. No etymology is apparent for the word.
