? {@dardurā@}¦ (most <ab>mss.</ab> dardarā), <ab>sc.</ab> lipi, a kind of script: <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.135.7〕. <ls>Senartʼs note</ls> mentions this as one of the forms in the list which ‘<fr>ne laissent guère dʼincertitude</fr>’; to me it is by no means clear. Did <ls>Senart</ls> mean to associate it with the <lang>Skt.</lang> name of the mountain range, often associated with Malaya? As a mountain name. Dardara (rare and doubtful in <lang>Skt.</lang>, but in <lang>Pali</lang> Daddara) would merit consideration, as supported by most <ab>mss.</ab> But one would not expect a mountain-name here.
