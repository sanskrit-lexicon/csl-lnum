{@Gopā@}¦ (also {@Gopī@} and {@Gopikā@}, <ab>qq.v.</ab>; in <lang>Pali</lang> a Sākiya girl named Gopī or Gopikā is known, but not identified with the Bodhisattvaʼs wife), <ab>n.</ab> of a Śākya girl, who in <ls>LV</ls> and <ls>Suv</ls> becomes the wife of the Bodhisattva (in most other texts he marries {@Yaśodharā@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>): <ls>LV</ls> 〔142.8 ff.〕 (daughter of {@Daṇḍapāṇi@}); 〔157.4 ff.〕; 〔194.7 ff.〕; 〔230.3 ff.〕; 〔237.19〕; <ls>Suv</ls> 〔200.8〕; in <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔1071〕 Gopī or Gopā, named next to Yaśodharā, but there is no reason to assume their identification (<ls>Mironov</ls> reads Gopā without <ab>v.l.</ab>); in <ls>Gv</ls> 〔385.6 ff.〕 Gopā occurs as a Śākya-kanyā, who in 〔420.19〕 is the daughter of {@Daṇḍapāṇi@} (like the Gopā of <ls>LV</ls>), but there is here no suggestion that she married the Bodhisattva, <ab>tho</ab> she mentions him 〔419.20〕 (as well as {@Vairocana@}, 〔396.23〕).
