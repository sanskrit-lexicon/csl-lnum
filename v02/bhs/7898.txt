? {@dhātu-rāṣṭra@}¦, in °ṭropaśobhitāḥ <ls>Sukh</ls> 〔39.3〕, epithet of the rivers of Sukhāvatī; <ls>Müller, SBE 49.2</ls>, 〔p. 39〕, {%adorned with fields, full of metals%}. One <ab>mg.</ab> of <lang>Skt.</lang> dhātu is {%metal%} or {%mineral%}; if that is the <ab>mg.</ab> here, the <ab>cpd.</ab> might be rendered {%adorned with kingdoms characterized by minerals%}. I am very doubtful of this interpretation, but have no guess which seems to me plausible as to what {@dhātu@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>, means here.
