{@elapatra@}¦, <lex>m.</lex>, ({@1@}) one of four ‘great treasures’ (mahānidhi; <ab>cf.</ab> a similar group of four treasures in <lang>Pali</lang>, <ls>DN comm.</ls> 〔i.284.8〕, saṅkha, ela, uppala, puṇḍarīka), each presided over by a nāga king of (presumably) the same name (so definitely stated for Elapatra): <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.383.18—384.1〕 catvāro mahānidhayo saṃkho vārāṇasyāṃ mithilāyāṃ (19) padumo kaliṃgeṣu piṃgalo takṣaśilāyāṃ elapatro; vārāṇasyāṃ saṃkhasya māsiko (20) samājo vartati; tahiṃ nidhānādhipatayo nāgarājāno nimantritakā āgatā; (〔384.1〕) tatra ca elapatreṇa nāgarājñā praśnā sthāpitā (see below for <lang>Pali</lang> equivalent); ({@2@}) Elapatra, in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.384.1〕, above, <ab>n.</ab> of a nāga king presiding over the ‘treasure’ of the same name; presumably the same as the nāga (or nāga king) named (without reference to the ‘treasure’) <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔3271〕 (<ed>Kyoto ed.</ed> Elāpattra, by error; <ls>Mironov</ls> Ela° with no <ab>v.l.</ab>); <ls>Suv</ls> 〔162.9〕; <ls>Mmk</ls> 〔452.20〕; <ls>Kv</ls> 〔2.9〕; <ls>Māy</ls> 〔222.3〕; 〔247.2〕; certainly the same as the Elapatra (<ab>mss.</ab>; <ab>ed.</ab> wrongly <ab>em.</ab> Elā°) of <ls>Divy</ls> 〔61.4〕, <ab>tho</ab> here he is not called a nāga but one of the four ‘kings’ presiding over the four treasures (<ab>cf.</ab> <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.383.18 ff.〕 above), (<ls>Divy</ls> 〔61.1〕) atha catvāro mahārājāś caturmahānidhisthāḥ, (3—4, <ab>vs</ab>) Piṅgalaś ca Kaliṅgeṣu Mithilāyāṃ ca Pāṇḍukaḥ, Elapatraś ca Gāndhāre Śaṅkho Vārāṇasīpure. Besides the <lang>Pali</lang> parallel, <ls>DN comm.</ls> above, <ab>cf.</ab> the 9 treasures of Kubera which include Śaṅkha and Padma (with presiding personages of the same names), and among the Jains the 9 treasures of a cakravartin, which in their <lang>AMg.</lang> forms include piṃgala, paṇḍua (= pāṇḍuka), and saṃkha; the <lang>Skt.</lang> forms of these are recorded at least lexically. Note also in <lang>Pali</lang> the nāga king Erakapatta, of <ls>Dhp. comm.</ls> 〔iii.231 ff.〕, who however does not seem to be brought into relation to the ‘treasure’ called in <lang>Pali</lang> ela (above); but the <ab>vss</ab> attributed to him, and the replies to them, in <ls>Dhp. comm.</ls> are reproduced in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.384〕, see above.
