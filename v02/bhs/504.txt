{@adhyāhāriṇī-lipi@}¦, a kind of script: <ls>LV</ls> 〔126.9〕; so read for <ls>Lefm.</ls> madhyā° (after -lipiṃ), allegedly with all <ab>mss.</ab>; <ed>Calc.</ed> adhyā-, supported by <lang>Tib.</lang> <tib>bla</tib> ({%superior%}) <tib>thabs su bsnan pa</tib> ({%? augmentation to a higher means?%}), which suggests a form containing adhi; but I do not understand the meaning of either the <lang>Tib.</lang> or the <lang>BHS</lang> form, unless the latter means {%suppletive script%} (a term which might conceivably have been applied <ab>e.g.</ab> to writing of consonants alone, without vowels).
