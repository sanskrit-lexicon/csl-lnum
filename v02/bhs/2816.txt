{@ābhoga@}¦, <lex>m.</lex> (derived by <ls>Leumann, Das nordarische Lehrgedicht des Buddhismus, AKM</ls> 〔20.1, p. 68〕, from bhuj {%bend%}, as {%<ger>Anbiegung</ger>%} = {%<ger>Anlehnung</ger>%}; an-ā°, {%<ger>ohne Anlehnung <ab>d.h.</ab> ohne Rückhalt oder Stützpunkt</ger>%}. Some <lang>Pali</lang> interpreters also derive from this root, see <ls>PTSD</ls>. Whatever the etymology, the primary <ab>mg.</ab> in <lang>BHS</lang> is clearly {%effort%}; so some <lang>Skt.</lang> <ab>lexx.</ab>, = yatna. This also fits at least many <lang>Pali</lang> occurrences of ābhoga, but in <lang>Pali</lang> the word needs more study; <ab>dict.</ab> definitions are all unsatisfactory; it is often bracketed or equated with manasikāra, <ab>esp.</ab> with cetaso or cittassa, <ls>DN comm.</ls> 〔i.122.6—7〕, perhaps as (mental) {%effort%}, <ab>e.g.</ab> <ls>Miln.</ls> 〔97.10〕), {%effort, earnest application%} (directed towards, <lex>loc.</lex>): <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔2092〕 = <lang>Tib.</lang> <tib>sgrim pa, ḥjug pa, bzo (gzo) ba</tib>, {%endeavor; setting about; work%}; śīle ābhogaṃ kṛtvāna, {%having made effort for%} (in regard to) {%morality%} <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.358.7〕; 〔360.9〕; ekāntaśukleṣv eva karmasv ābhogaḥ karaṇīyaḥ, {%one must strive for …%} <ls>Divy</ls> 〔23.30—24.1〕; 〔55.12〕; 〔193.15〕; 〔289.23〕; sarvābhogavigato 'nābhogadharmatāprāptaḥ kāyavākcittautsukyāpagataḥ <ls>Dbh</ls> 〔64.15—16〕, {%rid of all%} (interested) {%effort, arrived at a state of effortless%} ({%impassive%}, see {@anābhoga@}) {%condition, free of bodily, vocal, mental desires%} (said of the Bodhisattva); in <ls>Dharmas</ls> 〔118〕, list of six ‘hindrances’ ({@āvaraṇa@}) to samādhi: kausīdya, māna, śāṭhya, auddhatya, anābhoga, satyābhoga; here anābhoga {%lack of effort%} has a bad sense, not a good one as in <ls>Dbh</ls> 〔64.16〕; satyābhoga is obscure (saty-ābhoga, {%effort directed towards something concretely existing%} as distinguished from abstract goals? if satya-ābhoga, as <ab>cpd.</ab>, I do not understand what it could mean as a {%hindrance to samādhi%}). See {@anābhoga, sābhoga@}, both clearly supporting <ab>mg.</ab> {%effort%}.
