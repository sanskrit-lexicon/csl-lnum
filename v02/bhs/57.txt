{@akṣaṇa@}¦, <lex>m.</lex> or <lex>nt.</lex> (= <lang>Pali</lang> akkhaṇa), {%inopportune birth, birth under such circumstances that one cannot learn from a Buddha%}. There are eight such in <lang>Pali</lang>, <ls>DN</ls> 〔iii.287.12 ff.〕; <ls>AN</ls> 〔iv.225.19 ff.〕 (9 in <ls>DN</ls> 〔iii.263.31 ff.〕), <ab>viz.</ab>: (at a time when a Buddha is living) one is born (1) in a hell, (2) as an animal, (3) as a preta, (4) as one of the ‘long-lived gods’, (5) in border countries or barbarian regions, (6) with perverted, heretical mentality, (7) dull, stupid, incapable of distinguishing the gospel from what is inconsistent with it; or (8) he is born capable of profiting from the gospel but at a time when no Buddha exists to teach it. (<ls>DN</ls> 〔iii.263 ff.〕 adds as 9th, after 〔No. 3〕, birth as an asura.) These same 8, transposing 6 and 7, are briefly listed <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔2299—2306〕: (1) narakāḥ, (2) tiryañcaḥ, (3) pretāḥ, (4) dīrghāyuṣo devāḥ, (5) pratyantajanapadam, (6) indriyavaikalyam, (7) mithyādarśanam, (8) tathāgatānām anutpādaḥ. In <ls>Dharmas</ls> 〔134 No. 5〕 is put before 4, otherwise 1—7 as in <ls>Mvy</ls>, but 8 (obviously by a secondary change) is wholly different: (1) narakopapattis, (2) tiryagupapattir, (3) yamalokopapattiḥ, (4) pratyantajanapadopapattir, (5) dīrghāyuṣadevopapattir, (6) indriyavikalatā, (7) mithyādṛṣṭiś, (8) cittotpādavirāgitatā (seems to be a different version of 6, which corresponds to <lang>Pali</lang> 7, while 8 of the others is omitted). As opposed to these there is only one {@kṣaṇa@}, {%opportune birth%}; see <ab>s.v.</ab> Eight akṣaṇa <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.363.3〕; <ls>LV</ls> 〔412.14〕; <ls>Śikṣ</ls> 〔2.4〕; 〔114.14〕; <ls>Gv</ls> 〔116.16〕; <ls>Suv</ls> 〔41.13〕. The word never means {%misfortune%} in general, but only {%unfavorable birth%}, and in most cases clearly in just the sense described above. So <ls>Śikṣ</ls> 〔147.14〕 akṣaṇagatiṃ na gacchaty anyatra sattvaparipākāt, (a Bodhisattva) {%is not born in an inopportune birth, except to mature creatures%} (the <ab>transl.</ab> misunderstands); <ls>LV</ls> 〔278.22〕 akṣaṇāni pithitāny abhūvan, and 〔279.19〕 akṣaṇāḥ pithitāḥ, are explained by <ls>Gv</ls> 〔112.19〕 sarvākṣaṇadvārakapāṭāni pithayiṣyati (or with text [Page003-a] pithapayiṣ°, see <ab>Chap.</ab> 43, <ab>s.v.</ab>) {%he will close the door-panels (opening into) all the inopportune births%}. The akṣaṇa are śodhita, {%purified%}, <ls>LV</ls> 〔53.6〕; 〔357.5〕, or made śūnya, {%empty%}, <ls>LV</ls> 〔358.13〕. Others: <ls>LV</ls> 〔12.3〕; 〔34.22〕; 〔275.21〕; 〔327.13〕; 〔364.7〕; <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.358.5〕; 〔371.12〕; 〔392.5〕 = <ls>Śikṣ</ls> 〔306.1〕; <ls>Av</ls> 〔i.291.12〕; <ls>RP</ls> 〔35.19〕; <ls>Śikṣ</ls> 〔69.5〕; <ls>Sukh</ls> 〔23.9〕; <ls>Gv</ls> 〔54.9〕 (preta-tiryaṅnarakākṣaṇe-gatāḥ); <ab>cf.</ab> <ls>Lévi, Sūtrāl.</ls> 〔17.26〕. On <ls>SP</ls> 〔163.8〕 akṣaṇāḥ saṃvṛtā <ab>cf.</ab> <ls>Senartʼs note</ls> <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.405 f.〕; it is (as <ls>Senart</ls> says) certainly secondary, the original being aghā(ḥ) aghasaṃvṛtā(ḥ), {%miseries, surrounded by miseries%} (in apposition with {@lokāntarikā@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>, <ab>sc.</ab> narakāḥ or nirayāḥ); akṣaṇāḥ in <ls>SP</ls> was, in my opinion as in <ls>Senart</ls>ʼs (if I understand him), a noun and a near-synonym of aghā(ḥ), {%(constituting) unfavorable births%}, see {@agha@} (2). Perhaps akṣaṇasaṃvṛtā(ḥ) was originally read after it(?). In <ls>Dbh.g.</ls> 〔7(343).4〕 read probably akṣaṇāḥ for text akṣalāḥ: sarve ti pāpapatitā 'kṣalāḥ (text) prabhonti.
