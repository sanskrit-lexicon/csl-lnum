{@samanvagībhūta@}¦ (<ab>mss.</ab> of <ls>Mv</ls>), {@samanvaṅgībhūta@} (other texts), {%provided%} (with), {%enjoying%} (<lex>instr.</lex>): only (except two <ab>vv.ll.</ab> in <ls>Mv</ls>) in cliché pañcabhiḥ kāmaguṇāiḥ, or in <ls>Mv</ls> pañca(hi) kāmaguṇehi, samarpita(ḥ, <ab>etc.</ab>) °bhūta(ḥ, <ab>etc.</ab>), <ab>foll.</ab> by krīḍati ramati paricārayati, or other forms of these or equivalent verbs; = {@samaṅgībhūta@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>, <lang>Pali</lang> samaṅgi°; on the <ls>Mv</ls> passages see samaṅgī°, which <ls>Senart</ls> always reads: samanvaṅgī° <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔7374〕; <ls>Divy</ls> 〔219.22 ff.〕; <ls>Śikṣ</ls> 〔166.8〕; <ls>AsP</ls> 〔488.11〕; <ls>MSV</ls> 〔i.113.2〕. There [Page564-a] seems no doubt that samaṅgī°, or °gi° (as <ab>app.</ab> always in <lang>Pali</lang> without <ab>v.l.</ab>), is the <ab>orig.</ab> form. In most <ls>Mv</ls> occurrences, some or all <ab>mss.</ab> read samanvagī° or °gi°; this may well have been the first change, and have actually existed in the language; it will have been analyzed as based on an <lex>adj.</lex> *sam-anvaga, equivalent to <lang>Pali</lang> anvaga (also anvagata), for anuga(ta), with intrusive -a- by <ab n="analysis">anal.</ab> of augmented verb forms, see <ls>CPD</ls>; no doubt the common synonym {@samanvāgata@} also helped in this creation. This was later modified to samanvaṅgī° (found in a single <ab>ms.</ab> at <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.31.6〕), the only <lang>BHS</lang> form outside of <ls>Mv</ls> (in five texts); it was doubtless analyzed as sam-anv-aṅgī°, <ab>cf.</ab> <lang>Skt.</lang> aṅgīkaroti and <lex>derivs.</lex>, as well as {@sam-aṅgin@}.
