? {@ahṛsvara@}¦, <lex>m.</lex> or <lex>nt.</lex>, or <lex>adj.</lex>, {%(making) a piteous sound, lament(ing)%}; in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.43.3, 6〕; 〔45.17〕 the <ab>mss.</ab> almost unanimously read ahṛsvaraṃ (or °rā; once one <ab>ms.</ab> ahīśvarā) krandamānā(ḥ), {%crying piteously%}, of hell-inhabitants. I cannot explain the form (it could be an adverb); but [Page086-b] <ls>Senart</ls>ʼs violent <ab>em.</ab> bhīṣmasvaram is unconvincing, even to himself (see his note).
