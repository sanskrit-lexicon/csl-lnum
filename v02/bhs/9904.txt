{@-prajñāyate@}¦, <lex>denom.</lex> from -prajñā, in jāti-prajñāyate jarā-pr° vyādhi-pr° maraṇa-pr° <ls>LV</ls> 〔19.12〕 (prose), {%there is knowledge of birth, old age, disease, death%}; based on <ab>cpd.</ab> jāti-prajñā, <ab>etc.</ab> <ls>Weller</ls> 〔18〕 wrongly assumes that jāti <ab>etc.</ab> are separate nouns, <ab>n. sg.</ab>, and prajñāyate <lex>pass.</lex>; this is the construction in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.52.10〕 jarā vyādhi maraṇaṃ (so <ab>mss.</ab>; <ls>Senart</ls> as one dvandva <ab>cpd.</ab>, <ab>em.</ab> °maraṇā) ca prajñāyanti, {%old age, disease, and death become known%}. In prose of <ls>LV</ls> it is hardly conceivable that jāti, vyādhi, and maraṇa would occur in one sentence as <ab>n. sg.</ab>; while in prose of <ls>Mv</ls> vyādhi is not at all surprising as <ab>n. sg.</ab>
