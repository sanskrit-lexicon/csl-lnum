{@tathādarśana@}¦, <lex>adj.</lex> <ab>Bhvr.</ab> (evidently = {@evaṃdarśana, °dṛṣṭi@}), {%holding such a view%}: <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.120.17〕 (sa) cāhaṃ bhikṣavo tathādarśanato evaṃ va (one <ab>ms.</ab> omits va) [Page249-a] samāno yena gayānagaraṃ tad avasāri, {%and, O monks%} (realizing the worthlessness of the doctrine of Rāma, taught by his son), {%from the holder of such a doctrine%} (<ab>viz.</ab> from Udraka Rāmaputra), {%being just as I was, I went off to Gayā-city%}; in 〔ii.119.6〕 we should expect a close parallel, in which the Bodhisattva leaves Ārāḍa Kālāma, but the text seems corrupt: sa khalv ahaṃ bhikṣavo tathādarśanāya (so, or °nāyai, <ab>mss.</ab>; <ls>Senart</ls> <ab>em.</ab> °nāyaiva; required is rather °nato, <ab>prob.</ab> followed by evaṃ va) samāno, <ab>etc.</ab> (he goes to Rājagṛha). (Otherwise <ls>Senart</ls>; ignoring the <ab>Bhvr.</ab> nature of the <ab>cpd.</ab> which seems guaranteed by evaṃdarśana, °dṛṣṭi.) Also <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.123.16〕 (prose) sa khalv ahaṃ … tathādarśanasamāno, {%I being of this opinion%} (as just stated in <ab>prec.</ab>).
