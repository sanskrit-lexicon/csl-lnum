{@sarvakālaka@}¦ (see also {@sārvakālika@}), <lex>adj.</lex> with pudgala, {%all-black, completely impure%}, said of a delinquent monk who has gone <ab>thru</ab> five rites of purification, but all wrongly done: <ls>MSV</ls> 〔iii.74.7〕; 〔77.6〕. If one or more of the five rites is done properly, the others wrongly, the delinquent remains impure and is called (successively) {@yadbhūyaskālaka@}, {%mostly black%}; {@upārdhakālaka@}, {%half black%}; {@ekadeśakālaka@}; and {@pradeśakālaka@}; if all are properly done, he is {%pure%}, {@apagatakālaka@}, <ab>q.v.</ab> In the virtual repetition, 〔p. 78〕, {@pradeśakālakaḥ@} is accidentally omitted, but {@ekadeśakālakaḥ@} (line 13) has the definition given above to pradeśa-k° (only one of the five rites being done wrongly), which seems likely to be right. The <ab>ms.</ab> several times writes -kālika for -kālaka.
