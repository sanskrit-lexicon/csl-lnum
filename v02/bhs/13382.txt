[{@vala@}¦, so <ls>Lefm.</ls> with most <ab>mss.</ab>, and <ed>Calc.</ed> bala, in <ls>LV</ls> 〔429.22〕 (prose)-nagnavalānupradāna-, which certainly must mean {%giving clothes to the naked%}. Neither bala nor vala nor even vara is recorded in any such <ab>mg.</ab> as {%garment%} or {%cloth%}. Two <ab>mss.</ab> are reported as reading vaila, which obviously intends caila; so read with <ls>Foucaux</ls> (〔Notes 206〕).]
