{@bhit(t)vara@}¦, <lex>adj.</lex>, {%ruined, broken-down%}: (of a house,) read bhitvara (with <ab>ms.</ab> <ms>Ḱ</ms>) or °ru (with 3 <ab>mss.</ab>, <ls>KN</ls>) in <ls>SP</ls> 〔85.4〕 (<ab>vs</ab>), for durbalam of both <ab>edd.</ab>, which the preceding and parallel sudurbalaṃ makes improbable; <lang>Tib.</lang> <tib>ḥjig (ñe)</tib> supports a form of bhid-; read for the next word bhairavaṃ, with all <lang>Nep.</lang> <ab>mss.</ab> of <ls>KN</ls>, also <ms>Ḱ</ms>, and <lang>Tib.</lang> <tib>ḥjigs</tib>, for <ls>KN</ls>ʼs <ab>em.</ab> itvara; this word (<ab>q.v.</ab>) is inappropriate here, yet similar enough in <ab>mg.</ab> to have helped in the creation of bhit(t)vara, as if bhid- plus tvara, modelled on i-tvara and <lang>Skt.</lang> ga-tvara; the latter has a <ab>mg.</ab> virtually identical with that required here. Is this the word intended by vidvarena (vi = bhi repeatedly here) in <ls>Dutreuil, C fragm.</ls> 〔XIIIvo〕, for which <lang>Pali</lang> <ls>SN</ls> 〔i.131.11〕 has bhindanena, <ab>v.l.</ab> °rena? See <ls>Barua and Mitra</ls> 〔211, 213〕.
