{@Āvarta@}¦, <lex>m.</lex>, <ab>n.</ab> of a sea and of a mountain: <ls>Divy</ls> 〔102.28〕; 〔103.23—104.20〕. Note: as common noun, āvarta seems to me to have only meanings which it has in <lang>Skt.</lang>, as {%turn, turning, turning-place%} (dhāraṇyāvartāṃ … dhāraṇīṃ <ls>SP</ls> 〔475.8〕 <ab>etc.</ab>); {%eddy, whirlpool%} (<ls>Mvy</ls> 〔7037〕); <ab>etc.</ab>; in <ls>LV</ls> 〔126.7〕, several times, probably of {%turns%} (curves, or the like) of alphabetic signs; see {@utkṣepa-lipi@}.
