[{@madhyena@}¦ plus <lex>gen.</lex>, alleged to mean {%to%}, equivalent of <lex>loc.</lex> of goal (<lang>Hindi</lang> meṃ), <ab>acc.</ab> to <ls>Senart</ls> <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii n. 502〕, on 〔iii.287.2〕 ahaṃ rākṣasīdvīpasya madhyena gacchāmi. But this means, not {%I am going to the island of ogresses%}, but {%I am going by way of the island …%} (so madhyena in <lang>Skt.</lang>), as is proved by 〔291.4—5〕; the merchantʼs goal was a puṇya samudrapattana, where he collected jewels and then returned home.]
