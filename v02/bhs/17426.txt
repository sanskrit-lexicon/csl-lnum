{@sthita-lapa@}¦ (<ab>v.l.</ab> sthita-raya), °pā (<ab>n. pl.</ab>), <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.134.10〕, of Bodhisattvas; <ab>foll.</ab> by {@akāmakāmin@}, <ab>q.v.</ab> <ls>Senart</ls> suggests taking sthita as {%stopped%}, virtually = sthāpita, a <ab>mg.</ab> which is not recorded for it in <lang>Pali</lang>, and in <lang>Skt.</lang> is supported, if at all, by <ls>Ind. Spr.</ls> 〔6986〕 na sthitaḥ, {%you didnʼt stop%}. If this somewhat dubious suggestion is accepted, I would assume {@lapa@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>, in the <ab>mg.</ab> of {@lapana@}, and render {%having abandoned boasting%} (in the sense of {@lapana@}). Otherwise <ls>Senart</ls>.
