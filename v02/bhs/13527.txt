{@vāraṇa@}¦ (<lex>m.</lex>, = <lang>Pali</lang> <ab>id.</ab>; ignored by <ls>Senart</ls>), a kind of bird, which had a pleasant voice (<ls>Jāt.</ls> 〔vi.539.16〕) and beautiful eyes (<ls>Mv</ls>); only in <ab>cpd.</ab> °ṇa-cakora-nayana: <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.259.6〕; 〔267.15〕; 〔269.15〕; applied to Yaśodharā and Rāhula. In some <lang>Pali</lang> texts identified with the hatthiliṅga (<ab>cf.</ab> vāraṇa, {%elephant%}), which is described as {%a sort of vulture with a bill like an elephantʼs trunk%} (<ls>Childers</ls>, <ls>PTSD</ls>); but it seems questionable whether such attractive qualities as the above would be attributed to any vulture-like bird.
