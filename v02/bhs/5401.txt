{@Kṣemā@}¦, ({@1@}) (= <lang>Pali</lang> Khemā) <ab>n.</ab> of Śākyamuniʼs chief female disciple: <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.251.21〕 (agrā … śrāvikā); ({@2@}) <ab>n.</ab> of a daughter of King Prasenajit, who also became a nun in the Buddhaʼs order: <ls>Av</ls> 〔ii.46.7 ff.〕; in 〔50.9〕 she is, in fact, declared by Buddha to be agrā me … bhikṣuṇīnāṃ mama śrāvikāṇāṃ, so that she is actually identified with (1); her story, however (<ls>Av</ls> 〔no. 79〕) is wholly different from the story of Khemā in <lang>Pali</lang>. (<ls>Mv</ls> gives no story about Kṣemā 1.).
