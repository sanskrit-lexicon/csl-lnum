[{@nitya@}¦, <ab>acc.</ab> to <ls>Senart</ls> used as synonym for nirvāṇa, <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.140.16〕 (<ab>vs</ab>), see his note, comparing 〔ii.144.4〕. But this seems hardly sufficient evidence, and I have been unable to find elsewhere in <lang>Pali</lang> or <lang>BHS</lang> or <lang>Skt.</lang> any such use of nitya. Text: nityāntareṇa manasā kṛtamokṣabuddhiḥ, mārgaṃ (? <ab>mss.</ab> āryaṃ) va (<ab>mss.</ab> ca) tāva mama putra cara prasīda, jīvāmi yāvac ca ahaṃ (so <ab>mss.</ab>) …, (Śuddhodana pleads with the Bodhisattva to wait for his own death before renouncing the world; text in part uncertain;) {%with constantly internal mind fixing your will on salvation%} (<ab>i.e.</ab> keeping it to yourself, not doing anything about it yet) {%… as long as I live …%} The word nitya, at any rate, seems to have its <lang>Skt.</lang> meaning.]
