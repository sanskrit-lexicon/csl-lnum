{@sāhasrī@}¦ (= <lang>AMg.</lang> sāhassī; <ab>cf.</ab> {@sahasrī@}), {%(a group of) one thousand%}: in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.148.17〕 (<ab>vs</ab>) five of six <ab>mss.</ab> read viṃśa sahasriyo teṣāṃ, but meter seems to favor, with <ls>Senart</ls>, viṃśat sāh°. In some citations under {@sahasrī@}, in prose, some <ab>mss.</ab> read sāh°. <ab>Cf.</ab> {@tri-sāhasrī@}, but this seems to be adjectival (<ab>sc.</ab> lokadhātu).
