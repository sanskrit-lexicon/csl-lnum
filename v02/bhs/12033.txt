{@māla@}¦, ({@1@} = <lang>Skt.</lang> mālā, {%garland%}, as prior member of <ab>cpd.</ab>, so also in <lang>Skt.</lang>, see <ls>BR</ls>: samantajvālā-māla-paryeṣitām (Tārām) <ls>Mmk</ls> 〔65.14〕;) ({@2@}) = {@māḍa@}, {%hall, pavilion%}, [Page431-b] in {@maṇḍala-māḍa, °māla@}, <ab>q.v.</ab> Perhaps this same word is to be recognized in the <ab>Bhvr.</ab> <ab>cpd.</ab> candana-māla, {%having halls of sandalwood%}, <ab>ep.</ab> of prāsāda, {%palace%}, in <ls>Divy</ls> 〔43.1, 7〕; 〔49.27 ff.〕, and of a vihāra in <ls>Karmav</ls> 〔64.1〕. But <ls>Lévi</ls> in his note <ab>ad loc.</ab> identifies ({@3@}) -māla here with {@mālā@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>, and supports his theory with the <ab>cpd.</ab> {@mālāvihāra@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>; he may be right (in that case, {%having tops%} or {%crowning pavilions of sandālwood%}); the matter seems to me doubtful.
