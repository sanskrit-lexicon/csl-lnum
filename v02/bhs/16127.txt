{@samudita@}¦, in ālaya-samudita <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.314.3, 4〕, see <ab>s.v.</ab> {@ālaya@} (2): {%taking delight in%} is certainly the <ab>mg.</ab> It is natural to think of <ab>em.</ab> to saṃmudita; but the <ab>corresp.</ab> <lang>Pali</lang> has in <ls>SN</ls> 〔i.136.12〕 and 13 samudita, and this is a <ab>v.l.</ab> for saṃmudita of text in another parallel <ls>Vin.</ls> 〔i.4.36 f.〕 On the other hand, we find in <lang>Pali</lang> similar triple formulas containing -ārāma, -rata, and -saṃmudita in <ls>MN</ls> 〔i.503.22〕; <ls>SN</ls> 〔iv.389.10〕; 〔390.1—2〕. <ls>PTSD</ls> recognizes samudita, {%excited%} (allegedly from sam-ud-i, {%‘aroused’%}), as well as saṃmudita {%delighted%}, and <ls>Childers</ls> cites, without reference, samuditamano ({%elevated, excited%}) udaggamano attamano, where the meaning seems clearly {%rejoiced%}. I have failed to note saṃmudita in <lang>BHS</lang>, or any other occurrence of samudita in this sense. Surely one of the two words is an ancient corruption of the other.
