{@niṣaṇṇa@}¦, <lex>nt.</lex> (not recorded as <lex>subst.</lex>), {%sitting down%}: gamanaṃ (<ab>mss.</ab> gataṃ, <ab>unmetr.</ab>) sthitaṃ niṣaṇṇaṃ śayitaṃ lokottaraṃ munino (= Buddhasya) <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.167.18〕, {%supra-worldly is the going, standing, sitting, lying of a Buddha%} (a Lokottaravādin doctrine); note that <lang>Skt.</lang> (<ab>tho</ab> rarely) uses sthita as a noun (like gamana); perhaps this otherwise unknown use of niṣaṇṇa and {@śayita@} is influenced by that.
