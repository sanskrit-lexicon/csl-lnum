[{@ātmabhāvatā@}¦, <ls>Senart</ls>ʼs <ab>em.</ab> <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.301.11〕 (prose) sarvatra bodhisattvasya °tām anuprāptāṃ saṃjānanti; should mean {%embodiment%}, from ātmabhāva plus -tā. But the occasion is the approach to his enlightenment (not his conception or birth), which is signalized by miracles and cosmic portents. The <ab>mss.</ab> read °bhāvanām, which is doubtless right: {%they recognize on all sides that the Bodhisattvaʼs self-realization%} (ātma-bhāvanā) {%is at hand%}.]
