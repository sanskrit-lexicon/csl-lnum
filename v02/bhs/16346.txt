{@saṃmiñjayati@}¦ (= <lang>Pali</lang> °jeti, also written samiñjeṭi; connected with {@un-minj-, ni-miñj-@}, and <ab>prec.</ab> and next; in <ab>mss.</ab> and <ab>edd.</ab> also written samiñj-, but incorrectly, see below), {%bends back, draws in, contracts%}, parts of the body, <ab>esp.</ab> the arms; always <ab>assoc.</ab> with its opposite prasārayati (<lang>Skt.</lang>), {%extends%}: saṃmiñjitaṃ (vā) bāhuṃ (in <ls>Mv</ls> oftener °tāṃ … bāhāṃ) prasāraye(t, once °yeya) prasāritaṃ (vā, or ca) bāhuṃ (the noun may be omitted; <ls>Mv</ls> oftener °tāṃ … bāhāṃ) saṃmiñjaye(t) <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.55.1, 14〕; 〔56.8〕; 〔iii.425.15, 22〕; 〔450.16〕; <ls>Mmk</ls> 〔3.26〕; <ls>Divy</ls> 〔473.6〕; <ls>Waldschmidt, Kl. Skt. Texte 4</ls>, 〔65.20〕 (Śakrapraśnasūtra, <ab>acc.</ab> to 〔p. 5〕, <ab>ms.</ab> saṃmiñcita, but text prints saṃmiñj°); 〔157.18〕 (<ls>Mahāsamāj.</ls>); (yato care yato tiṣṭhe yato āse yato śaye, so <ls>Senart</ls> <ab>em.</ab>,) yato saṃmiñjaye kāyaṃ yato kāyaṃ prasāraye <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.422.(16—)17〕 (so <ls>Senart</ls>, <ab>em.</ab>, but <ab>prob.</ab> rightly), in a description of a bhikṣu, {%whenever he draws in or extends%} (any member of) {%his body%}. <ls>Leumann, Album Kern</ls> 〔393 f.〕, adopts an earlier suggestion of <ls>Kern</ls>ʼs and derives from sam-vṛj-. He rightly distinguishes this verb from <lang>Pali</lang> sam-iñjati (<ls>Dhp.</ls> 〔81〕, na samiñjanti paṇḍitā), {%is moved, is perturbed%}; <ab>cf.</ab> <lang>BHS</lang> {@iñjate@}. But when <ls>Leumann</ls> states that this sam-iñjati, in its <lang>Pali</lang> <ab>mg.</ab>, is also found in <lang>BHS</lang>, I fear that he was speaking carelessly. The only cases of sam-iñj- which I have noted are shown by association with forms of prasār- to be false readings for saṃmiñj-; such cases also occur in <lang>Pali</lang> (<ls>PTSD</ls>). The only ‘confusion’ shown by <lang>BHS</lang> in this sept consists in the erroneous writing of samiñj- for saṃmiñj- (which <ls>Leumann</ls> also recognizes). <ls>Leumann</ls>ʼs <ab>etym.</ab> seems to me at least more plausible than any other, including that of <ls>Lüders</ls> (<ab>s.v.</ab> {@samarjana@}). That double mm (or ṃm), not single m, is the only correct form is proved by un-miñj- and nimiñj-, neither of which occurs in <lang>Pali</lang>; <ls>Leumann</ls> considers them (as he must according to his etymology) secondarily abstracted from saṃ-miñj-. I have found no trace of the sept elsewhere.
