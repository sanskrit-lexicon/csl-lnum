{@satpuruṣa@}¦ (<ab>cf.</ab> <lang>Skt.</lang> <ab>id.</ab>, <lang>Pali</lang> sappurisa), <ab>lit.</ab> {%worthy%} or {%true man%}: <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔7358〕; sixteen s° listed <ls>SP</ls> 〔3.10〕, the chief being Bhadrapāla, who is the only one named in <ls>RP</ls> 〔2.3〕, where 16 are also referred to. They are evidently a lay category, and are mentioned immediately after a list of Bodhisattvas. According to <ls>Professor Paul Mus (oral communication, May, 1949)</ls>, they are a kind of lay equivalent of the Bodhisattvas, who live the life of gṛhapatis; <ls>Prof. Mus</ls> finds a typical illustration of them in the figure of {@Vimalakīrti@} (<ab>q.v.</ab>), so well known in Chinese Buddhism. In <lang>BHS</lang>, <ab n="Vimalakīrti">V.</ab> is not listed so far as I know except once in a list of 16 Bodhisattvas. The term satpuruṣa may include monks: <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.37.4〕 (see <ab>s.v.</ab> {@labhā, labhyaṃ@}).
