{@hirodaka@}¦ (not ahiro°!), <ls>Divy</ls> 〔384.24〕, <ab>acc.</ab> to 〔Note p. 709〕 hirā-udaka, {%vein-water, blood%}: but this is quite implausible. The phrase is hirodakasikatāpiṇḍair aṇḍakāṣṭhebhyo (see this) 'pi asārataratvaṃ kāyasyāvetya, {%realizing that the body is more worthless even than eggshells(?) full of%} (? so <ls>Burnouf, Introd.</ls> 〔376〕) {%lumps of sand, water, and gravel%}. (<ls>Burnouf</ls>, {%<fr>pleines de boules de sable faites avec des</fr>%} [Page620-b] {%<fr>larmes de serpent</fr>%}.) The <lex>instr.</lex> -piṇḍair is apparently associative, with the following word; perhaps render {%eggshells along with lumps%} <ab>etc.</ab>, {%eggshells%} (if <ls>Burnouf</ls> is right) being likewise symbolic of worthlessness, and also fragility. In <ls>Deśīn.</ls> 〔8.66〕 is noted hilā, {%sand%} (vālukā); hirā is <ab>prob.</ab> equivalent to this. It would fit with sikatā, and udaka could perhaps be used as a symbol of worthlessness.
