{@prakāra?@}¦ in <ls>SP</ls> 〔146.5〕 (<ab>vs</ab>) puṣpaiḥ (so all <ab>mss.</ab>, <ls>KN</ls> <ab>em.</ab> puṣpa-, kept by <ls>WT</ls> without note) prakāraiḥ samalaṃkṛtaṃ ca; <ab>acc.</ab> to <lang>Tib.</lang> {%adorned with many flowers%} (<tib>me tog maṅ pos</tib>). On the face of the reading of the <ab>mss.</ab> and the <lang>Tib.</lang> rendering, prakāra should be an <lex>adj.</lex>, {%many%}; it is otherwise known only as a noun, {%kind, sort%}. <ls>KN</ls>ʼs <ab>em.</ab> hardly helps; {%with kinds of flowers%} could not, so far as I know, serve as a substitute for {%with many kinds …%}; for this we should expect bahu-, nānā-, or the like, modifying prakāra. I have thought of reading pravāraiḥ, taking it as = pravaraiḥ, {%excellent%}, with ā for a <ab>m.c.</ab>; but <lang>Tib.</lang> does not support this.
