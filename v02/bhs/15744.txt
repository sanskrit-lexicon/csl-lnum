{@saṃdṛśyati@}¦, {%sees%}: <ls>Gv</ls> 〔523.20—21〕 yathā māyākāro … sarvarūpagatāni sarvakriyāś ca saṃdṛśyati (by his magic power). Seems to be a nonce-formation analogical to saṃdṛśyante, regular passive, {%they are seen%}, which occurs three times in the text just before (lines 16, 18, 20); the meaning is confirmed by the following conclusion of the simile: evam eva sudhanaḥ … tāni sarvavyūhavikurvitāny adrākṣīt. To the <lex>pass.</lex> saṃdṛśyate, {%is seen%}, was formed an active saṃdṛśyati, {%sees%}. The same seems true once of {@dṛśyati@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>
