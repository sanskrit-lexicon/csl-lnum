{@tasarikā@}¦ (from <lang>Skt.</lang> tasara, {%shuttle%}), in <ls>Divy</ls> 〔83.24〕 (prose), <ab>acc.</ab> to Index {%weaving%}, as {%operation of the shuttle%}; this force of the suffix would seem peculiar, but the context gives little help: (Śacy api …) tasarikāṃ kartum ārabdhā. In the preceding sentence Śakra, in disguise, vastraṃ vāyitum ārabdhaḥ. Perhaps tasarikāṃ kartum, {%to make the%} (little) {%shuttle%}, means only {%to operate the shuttle%}.
