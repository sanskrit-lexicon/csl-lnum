{@phalaha-@}¦, also written {@°kha, °ka@}, in <ab>comp.</ab> with stāra (<ab>cf.</ab> <lang>AMg.</lang> phalaha, defined as {%a big plank%}, <ls>Ratnach.</ls>, and identified with <lang>Skt.</lang> phalaka), some part of a gate or door: <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.195.13〕; 〔iii.228.10〕 (prose; same passage); following the sentence containing {@phalikha-@} (<ab>q.v.</ab>)-phalakāni; in 〔i.195.13〕 <ab>mss.</ab> phalaha-stārā(ḥ), <ls>Senart</ls> <ab>em.</ab> phalaka-; in 〔iii.228.10〕 he reads phalaka° without <ab>v.l.</ab>, but <ab>acc.</ab> to his 〔note i p. 530〕, on the other passage, one <ab>ms.</ab> at least reads phalakha-stārā(ḥ); it seems reasonably clear that the <lang>AMg.</lang> form, conceivably with °kha for °ha, was read in <ls>Mv</ls>. (<ab>Cf.</ab> {@phalikāstaraṇa?@} but I cannot mediate between these two forms, both enigmatic.)
