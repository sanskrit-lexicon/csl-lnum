{@syāt, siyāti@}¦ (as in <lang>Pali</lang>, <lang>AMg.</lang> siyā; in only Jain <lang>Skt.</lang>, see <ls>BR</ls>), {%perhaps%}; common at end of Jātaka stories, usually: syāt khalu (punar) bhikṣavaḥ yuṣmākam (rarely omitted) evam asyā (or asyāt), {%it may be, however, monks, that you may have the idea …%}, <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.64.2〕; 〔68.13〕; 〔72.4, 8, 10〕; 〔81.17〕; 〔83.7〕; 〔89.1, 3, 6〕; 〔94.5, 8〕; 〔113.16〕; 〔114.3〕; 〔176.15〕; 〔219.4〕; 〔iii.76.18〕, and often in <ls>Mv</ls>; so in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.45.1, 5, 8, 11〕, read siyāti (〔§ 29.41〕; <ls>Senart</ls> siyā ti) punar … evam asya syāt; yasyeha pariśeṣaṃ syān (so <ab>mss.</ab> 〔ii.3.7〕, in 〔i.199.9〕 syā) nārīye (°yo) jīvitaṃ bhavet <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.199.9〕 = 〔ii.3.7〕 (<ab>vs</ab>), {%of what woman there may be perchance remaining in this world a life%} (of ten months and seven days); <ls>Senart</ls> reads syā in both places and takes it for the pronoun asyāḥ, which seems to me impossible (〔§ 21.84〕).
