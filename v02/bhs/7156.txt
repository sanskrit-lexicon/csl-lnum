{@traividya@}¦, <lex>adj.</lex>, and {@°ya-tā@}, noun (= <lang>Pali</lang> tevijja, °ja-tā), (state of) {%possessing the three knowledges%}. In <lang>Pali</lang> (see <ls>Childers</ls> <ab>s.v.</ab> vijjā and <ls>Lévi, Sūtrāl.</ls> 〔vii.9〕, note), these are either (1) knowledge that all is anicca, dukkha, anatta, or (2) knowledge of former births (pubbenivāsa), of the (future) rebirths of beings (cutūpapāta), and of the destruction of the depravities (āsava-khaya); of these the first and the third are two of the {@abhijñā@} (<lang>Pali</lang> abhiññā), <ab>q.v.</ab>, and the second results from another abhijñā, <ab>viz.</ab> divyacakṣus (see <ab>s.v.</ab> {@upapāda@}), so that these three abhijñā are identified in <lang>BHS</lang> as the three vidyā, <ls>AbhidhK. LaV-P.</ls> 〔vii.108〕. So far as I have found, this second of the two <lang>Pali</lang> sets is the only one recognized in <lang>BHS</lang>, where the category is in any case of very restricted occurrence; I have failed to record it except in <ls>SP</ls> and <ls>LV</ls>. In <ls>SP</ls> only the <lex>adj.</lex> occurs, always associated with ṣaḍabhijña, {%having the six%} {@abhijñā@}, as in: te traividyāḥ ṣaḍabhijñā(ḥ) … <ls>SP</ls> 〔179.17〕 (prose), and in verses (always separate ṣaḍabhijña from traividya! text makes them <ab>cpd.</ab>) 〔90.7〕; 〔129.10〕; 〔150.2〕; 〔155.2〕; no such association in <ls>LV</ls>, where context never helps in interpretation; <lex>adj.</lex>, traividya (<lex>voc.</lex>) <ls>LV</ls> 〔363.16〕 (<ab>vs</ab>); noun, traividyatādhigatā 〔350.14〕 (so read with best <ab>mss.</ab> for text traividyādh°); °dyatā daśabalena … prāptā 〔352.17〕; °tām anuprāptaṃ 〔353.13〕 (prose); the last suggests that in 〔426.13〕 (prose) it is necessary to <ab>em.</ab> to traividyatānuprāpta (text °dyānu°, no <ab>v.l.</ab>) ity ucyate (said of Buddha).
