({@vimāna@}¦, <lex>nt.</lex> and <lex>m.</lex>, = <lang>Skt.</lang> <ab>id.</ab>; on use in <lang>Pali</lang>, see elaborate article in <ls>PTSD</ls>; even in <lang>Skt.</lang>, see <ls>BR</ls>, it is not exclusively used of divine, nor yet of mobile, residences, but may apply to any luxurious dwelling-place, which in India would naturally include the surrounding grounds; see <ls>Mrs. Rhys Davids, Minor Anthologies of the Pali Canon Part IV, 1942</ls>, 〔p. vi〕: ‘… more than houses, including gardens, woods, lakes’ <ab>etc.</ab> … ‘{%estates%} might have been more literally correct’, but she uses {%mansions%}; several times in <ls>Jm</ls> the word is applied to something located in woods and used by a king for amusement; <ls>Speyer</ls> {%arbors%}, <ls>pw</ls> 〔7.375〕 ‘<ger>etwa {%Hain%}</ger>’, but surely buildings seem to be involved: vimāna-deśeṣu <ls>Jm</ls> 〔182.22, 183.3〕; the king takes a siesta śrīmati °na-pradeśe 〔183.10〕; the king stays for a time śrīmati pravivikte °na-deśe 〔192.23〕; vane manoharodyāna-°na-bhūṣite 〔208.20〕. <lang>Pali</lang> certainly also uses the word, as does <lang>Skt.</lang> more commonly, of the air-traveling palaces of the gods; and I question whether either <lang>Pali</lang> or <lang>BHS</lang> gives it any meaning which could not be matched in <lang>Skt.</lang> On <ls>Divy</ls> 〔399.18〕, where <ls>pw</ls> also sees the meaning {%<ger>Hain</ger>%}, see {@Śairīṣaka@}; nothing in the context suggests any reason for departure from the common meaning, {%celestial%}, and no doubt {%mobile, palace%}.)
