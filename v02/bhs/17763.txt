{@hema-jāla@}¦ (not noted as <ab>cpd.</ab> in <lang>Skt.</lang>; <lang>Pali</lang> <ab>id.</ab>, defined as covering for gift-elephants, gift-chariots, a heavenly mansion or vimāna and the body of a possessor of one; <lang>AMg.</lang> °jālaga, {%a kind of ornament%}, <ls>Ratnach.</ls>), <ab>lit.</ab> {%gold-net%}, but seems to have acquired a special <ab>mg.</ab>, which is not clear: in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.171.8〕 (<ab>vs</ab>) one of the 60 qualities of a Buddhaʼs voice is that it is hemajāla-tulya-ravā, {%sounding like a …%}; in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.195.5〕 the {%railing-networks%} (vedikā-jāla, see {@vedikā@}) of Dīpavatī, and in 〔196.4〕 each of its city gates, are covered with two hemajāla, one of gold and the other of silver! (〔195.5〕) dvihi hemajālehi praticchannā abhūṣi suvarṇamayena ca °lena rūpyamayena ca; the next sentence, both times, says that the golden hemajāla had bells of silver, the silver one bells of gold; <ls>Senart</ls> supposes that hema- has come to mean {%precious substance%} in general, but I know of nothing else to support this; on the other hand, in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.453.17〕 the <ab>lit.</ab> <ab>mg.</ab> may well apply, elephants being described as hemajāla-praticchanna (misprinted hemalāla° in text), as in <lang>Pali</lang> <ls>AN</ls> 〔iv.393.21〕 (°saṃchanna).
