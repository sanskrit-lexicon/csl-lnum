<hom>1</hom> {@anu@}¦, <lex>indecl.</lex> in noun and verb <ab>cpds.</ab>; (a) in distributive (? or intensive) noun <ab>cpds.</ab>, as in <lang>Pali</lang>, <ls>CPD</ls> <ab>s.v.</ab> anu (g); also in <lang>JM</lang>, <ab>e.g.</ab> gāmāṇugāmaṃ <ls>Jacobi, Erz.</ls> 〔13.2〕; rare in <lang>Skt.</lang>, ‘typical in <ab>Buddh.</ab>’, <ls>Renou, Gr. scte.</ls> 〔p. 94〕: divasānudivasaṃ, <lex>adv.</lex>, {%day after day%}, <ls>Av</ls> 〔i.208.10〕; 〔261.14〕; see {@kālānukālam, kṣudrānukṣudra, kṣudrakānukṣudraka, anucāra, anudharma@}; but the usage is not always clear and the last-named, at least, <ab>prob.</ab> does not belong here; (b) in verb <ab>cpds.</ab> used in many cases which have no parallels in <lang>Skt.</lang>, nor (often) even in <lang>Pali</lang> or <lang>Pkt.</lang>; usually before other preverbs. See the following entries in this work. Very often it is hard to see any definite meaning which anu adds; <lang>Tib.</lang> in its wooden way renders by <tib>rjes su</tib>, {%after%}, which as <ls>Jäschke</ls> says ‘is often not to be translated’.
