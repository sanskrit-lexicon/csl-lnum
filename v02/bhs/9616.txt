{@Purāṇa@}¦ (= <lang>Pali</lang> <ab>id.</ab>), <ab>n.</ab> of a sthapati of Prasenajit, associate of {@Iṣiḍatta@}, <ls>Divy</ls> 〔77.27〕; 〔466.23〕, or {@Ṛṣidatta@}, spelled {@Riṣidatta@} in <ls>Av</ls> 〔i.224.3〕, and {@Ṛddhidatta@} in <ab>mss.</ab> <ls>Av</ls> 〔ii.9.7〕. He, and perhaps his associate, were doubtless referred to in <ls>MSV</ls> 〔ii.70.4〕, which must contain a lacuna as well as more than one corruption. See also next.
