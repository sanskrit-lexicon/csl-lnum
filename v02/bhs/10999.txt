? {@busaplāvī@}¦, <lex>acc.</lex> <ab>sg.</ab> °vīm, something disagreeable (hard, or foul, offensive) to eat; parallel with ayoguḍa, svamāṃsa, pūyaśoṇita: <ls>Divy</ls> 〔12.25〕; 〔13.17〕; all things which niggards wished a mendicant should eat, and which later they were therefore obliged to eat themselves. The Index renders {%beetle%} (?); I do not know why. The first member seems to be <lang>Skt.</lang> busa, {%chaff, refuse, rubbish%}; <ab>perh.</ab> the <ab>ed.</ab> of <ls>Divy</ls> understood the latter part as {%leaping%} ({%in chaff%} of grain; even this need not lead to the <ab>mg.</ab> {%beetle%}). Same passage <ls>MSV</ls> 〔iv.176.7〕; 〔177.11〕; <lang>Tib.</lang> cited as <tib>phub ma</tib>, {%chaff%} (= busa), for the entire word.
