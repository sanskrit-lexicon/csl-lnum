{@a-prativartiya@}¦ (semi-<lang>MIndic</lang> for °tya; = <lang>Pali</lang> appaṭivattiya), {%not to be turned back%} (by any creature; said of the dharmacakra, once set in motion by a Buddha): <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.327.7〕 (<ab>vs</ab>, no <ab>v.l.</ab>); in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.330.4〕 (prose) doubtless [Page048-a] read so with 1 <ab>ms.</ab>, the other pravartayaṃ, <ls>Senart</ls> <ab>em.</ab> apravartiyaṃ; in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.331.4〕 <ls>Senart</ls> with <ab>mss.</ab> apravartiyaṃ, in 〔332.7〕 apravartitaṃ, which is read in the same formula <ls>SP</ls> 〔179.1〕 (prose, no <ab>v.l.</ab>); in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.332.21〕 aparivartitaṃ, in 〔333.12〕 apravartiyaṃ, <ab>v.l.</ab> aparivartiya. In <lang>Pali</lang> apparently only appaṭi° occurs, and I believe this must have been the original reading. No being could {%turn back%} the wheel started by the Buddha. But evidently in <lang>BHS</lang> tradition this became confused with forms (<lex>ppp.</lex> as well as <lex>gdve.</lex>) of pra-, pari-vṛt-, which of course also yield a tolerable sense: {%which had never been set in motion%} or {%could not be set in motion%} by any (other) being.
