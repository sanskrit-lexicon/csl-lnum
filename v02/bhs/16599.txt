{@sahāya@}¦, in <ls>LV</ls> 〔387.9〕 (<ab>vs</ab>), if text is right must mean {%accompanied%} (by, with <lex>instr.</lex>): adhunāpy asau tāṃ … saṃpūjayaty anyasuraiḥ sahāyaḥ, {%even now he honors it%}, [Page588-b] {%together with the other gods%}. But this use of sahāya seems unparalleled, and <lang>Tib.</lang> makes it agree with anyasuraiḥ: <tib>lha gzhan grogs daṅ lhan cig mchod pa byed</tib>, {%honors it together with the other companion gods%}; this implies sahāyaiḥ, which is <ab>prob.</ab> the true reading, <ab>tho</ab> no <ab>v.l.</ab> is cited. <ab>Cf.</ab> however {@sahīya@}, <ls>Buddhac.</ls> 〔x.26〕.
