{@gṛhapati@}¦ (= <lang>Pali</lang> gahapati), <ab>lit.</ab> {%householder%}, in °tiratna, as one of the 7 ‘jewels’ of a cakravartin: <ls>LV</ls> 〔14.5〕; <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.49.4〕; 〔193.17〕, <ab>etc.</ab>, see the lists <ab>s.v.</ab> {@ratna@} (3). The function of the gṛhapati-ratna is to discern the location of hidden treasures by means of the divya-cakṣus which he possesses, and bring those of them which are ownerless (asvāmika) into the possession of the king: <ls>LV</ls> 〔17.17—22〕; substantially the same statement in <lang>Pali</lang>, <ls>DN</ls> 〔ii.176.7 ff.〕 For this reason, no doubt, <ls>PTSD</ls> <ab>s.v.</ab> ratna translates gahapati by {%treasurer%}; but there is no clear evidence that he had precisely the functions which we should associate with that title. In <lang>Pali</lang> a gahapati (see <ls>PTSD</ls> <ab>s.v.</ab>) is, to be sure, often associated with seṭṭhi = śreṣṭhin; the <lang>Pali</lang> word is often rendered {%treasurer%}, but perhaps {%capitalist%} would be better (<ab>orig.</ab> {%guild-leader%}).
