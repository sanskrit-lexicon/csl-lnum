{@biliśa@}¦ (so once in <lang>Skt.</lang> for regular baḍiśa, <ls>Suparṇ.</ls>, <ls>pw</ls> 〔4.226〕; and note <lang>Pkt.</lang> biḍisa, <ls>Sheth</ls>; <lang>Pali</lang> only baḷisa, bal°), {%fishhook%}; some form or <ab>cpd.</ab> of this word is to be read in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.259.2〕, for <ab>mss.</ab> bilaśa (<ab>v.l.</ab> billaśa)-tānikāyetsuḥ, and 〔260.16〕 (<ab>vs</ab>), same reading, except that both <ab>mss.</ab> read billa° here; evidently a verb is concealed in the end; <ls>Senart</ls> reads pāṭensuḥ, and before it bilaśatāni, which is impossible. It is possible that bilaśa- (with one <ab>ms.</ab>) is the true reading, <ab>tho</ab> it is not recorded anywhere. The phrase follows, both times, that containing {@kahāpaṇa-māṃsikaṃ@} (or {@kārṣāpaṇa°@}), <ab>q.v.</ab>, while in <lang>Pali</lang> lists of tortures kahāpaṇakaṃ regularly follows balisamaṃsikaṃ. It is certain that we must understand some torture by means of {%fishhooks%}; should we read biliśa-tāṃ, {%fishhook-condition%}, <ab>i.e.</ab> being torn with fishhooks? The preceding words are much like those quoted as occurring before {@kahāpaṇa-māṃsikaṃ@}.
