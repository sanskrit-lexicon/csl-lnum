[{@Nandopananda@}¦, <ls>Divy</ls> 〔307.1〕; 〔329.9, 14〕, <ab>acc.</ab> to <ab>ed.</ab> name of one individual monk, a member or associate of the ṣaḍvargīya or ṣaḍvargika group, which <ab>acc.</ab> to <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔9471—2〕 contained two monks named Nanda and Upananda. This is, I believe, also the intention of <ls>Divy</ls>. In 〔307.1〕 understand Nandopananda- as <ab>cpd.</ab> with the following bhṛtaka-puruṣaḥ sa, {%he%} (the householder just mentioned) {%is a serving-man of Nanda and Upananda%}. In 〔329.9〕 and 14 understand two <lex>vocs.</lex>, Nanda-Upananda. However, in <ls>MSV</ls> 〔i.95.4〕 Nandopananda, <ab>sg.</ab>, is presented in the text as <ab>n.</ab> of one nāga king; <ab>cf.</ab> <ab>s.v.</ab> {@Nanda@} 2.]
