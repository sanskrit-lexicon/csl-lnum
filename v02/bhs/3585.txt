? {@udyojayati@}¦ (see also <ab>s.v.</ab> {@udyoṭita@}), <ab>acc.</ab> to <ls>Bendall and Rouse, Śikṣ Transl.</ls> 〔57 note 1〕, = <lang>Pali</lang> uyyojeti, {%dismisses, sends away%}: <ls>Śikṣ</ls> 〔56.2〕 yāvad dhārmaśravaṇikāś codyojayitavyāḥ parṣanmaṇḍalaṃ parisaṃsthāpayitavyam; but <lang>Tib.</lang> <tib>brtson par ḥgyur</tib>, = (to be) {%made zealous%}, the regular <lang>Skt.</lang> <ab>mg.</ab>; yāvad can be understood as {%up to the point%} (in the text where it is said—), thus fitting this <ab>mg.</ab>, and <ls>B. and R.</ls>ʼs interpretation seems implausible. [Page132-a] They assume the same <ab>mg.</ab> for <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.141.12〕 (bhagavān … asuranayutāni … samyaksaṃbodhīye vyākaritvā bahūni ca prāṇisahasrāṇi āryadharmeṣu pratiṣṭhāpayitvā rājānaṃ śuddhodanaṃ ca) saparivāraṃ ca udyojaye; but here too this verb (<ab>mss.</ab> udyojeya or °yaṃ) may well mean {%aroused, inspired%}, as regularly in <lang>Skt.</lang>; this accords well with the preceding parts of the sentence, and seems more natural than {%dismissed%} (<ab>tho</ab> <ab n="Śuddhodana">Ś.</ab> and his followers did in fact depart, as the next sentence says).
