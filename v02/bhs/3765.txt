{@upalambha@}¦ (<ab>cf.</ab> <lang>Skt.</lang> <ab>id.</ab>; not recorded in <lang>Pali</lang>; <ab>cf.</ab> <ab>prec.</ab>, {@an-upa°, an-upalabdhi@}, the next items, and {@aupalambhika@}), <ab>acc.</ab> to standard interpretation, {%mental perception%} or {%apperception, realization by the intellect%}; <ls>Sūtrāl.</ls> 〔xviii.92〕 <ab>comm.</ab> buddhyā pratipattiḥ; <lang>Tib.</lang> <tib>dmigs (-pa)</tib> {%thought, fancy, imagination; to construe in oneʼs mind%}, <ab>etc.</ab>; see also <ls>LaVallée-Poussin, AbhidhK.</ls> 〔Index〕 <ab>s.v.</ab> upalabdhi. Were it not for this persistent tradition, some occurrences, <ab>esp.</ab> of the <ab>neg.</ab> forms ({@an-upalambha, °labdhi@}), could easily be interpreted as related to upalabhyate (1) and <ab>mg.</ab> (non-){%occurrence%}, (non-){%existence%}. These <ab>mgs.</ab> are attributed by <ls>CPD</ls> to an-upaladdhi, °labbhana; and <ab>tho</ab> not recognized in <ls>PTSD</ls>, {%occurrence, existence%} seems to me the probable <ab>mg.</ab> of upaladdhi in the two passages cited for it, <ls>Miln.</ls> 〔268.7〕 and <ls>Vv. comm.</ls> 〔279.10〕. In many <lang>BHS</lang> places {%inconceivability%} or {%non-occurrence, non-reality%} would make equally good sense for an-upa°. I do not, however, venture to abandon what [Page140-b] seems to have been the standard tradition. Reliance on upalambha, {%mental perception, fancy%}, is an error, stigmatized as upalambha-dṛṣṭi, {%the heresy that relies on upalambha%}, <ls>LV</ls> 〔35.6〕 (or as <ab>Bhvr.</ab>, {%one who adheres to that heresy%}, <ls>SP</ls> 〔383.12〕); see also °dṛṣṭika. Similarly upalambha-saṃjñin <ls>Śikṣ</ls> 〔315.1〕, {%having the%} (false) {%notion of upalambha%}; upalambha-yogena, {%by the%} (erroneous) {%method of upalambha%}, <ls>ŚsP</ls> 〔1042.16〕, repeated formulaically (<ab>cf.</ab> anupalambha-yogena <ab>s.v.</ab> {@anupalambha@}).
