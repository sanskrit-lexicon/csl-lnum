{@ābṛhati@}¦ (and āvṛhati; see also {@āvṛṃhati@}) both occur in <lang>Skt.</lang> in <ab>mg.</ab> {%extracts, draws out%}, and in <lang>Pali</lang> as abbahati, abbuhati, abbū°, abbāheti, <ab>id.</ab> (as, thorns); both are so used also in <lang>BHS</lang>; but in <lang>BHS</lang> they both (oftener, it seems, spelled with v) have also the meaning exclusively noted for {@āvarhati@}, {%restores%} (a monk to good standing), which in <lang>Pali</lang> is abbheti (noun, abbhāna), apparently from <lang>Skt.</lang> āhvayati. I shall record such <ab>mgs.</ab>, even where texts read āb°, under {@āvarhati@}; in <lang>BHS</lang> the two groups are not clearly distinguishable. They may even be identical in origin, as <ls>N. Dutt</ls> holds, <ls>MSV</ls> 〔iii.74 n. 3〕 ({%withdrawal of offences%} committed by the monk implies restoration to good standing); so also in essence, <ab>tho</ab> doubtfully, <ls>Finot, Prāt</ls> 〔488 n. 1〕. But on this theory it is hard to explain <lang>Pali</lang> abbheti (abbhāna), and I incline to believe that <lang>BHS</lang> has a secondary and confused blend, in which a form close to the <lang>Pali</lang>, meaning {%recall%}, was adapted to the word meaning {%extract, remove%}.
