{@nau-krama@}¦, <lex>m.</lex>, <ls>Divy</ls> 〔55.17, 19〕, or {@nau-saṃkrama@}, <lex>m.</lex>, <ls>Divy</ls> 〔55.24 ff.〕; 〔386.10〕; <ls>Av</ls> 〔i.64.1, 5〕; 〔66.3〕; <ab>acc.</ab> to <ls>Divy Index</ls> and <ls>Speyerʼs Index to Av</ls>, {%bridge of boats%} (joined together): <ab>e.g.</ab> naukramo māpitaḥ <ls>Divy</ls> 〔55.17, 19〕. But this interpretation is difficult in <ls>Divy</ls> 〔386.(9—)10〕, (nauyānenāgamiṣyatīti yāvac ca Mathurāṃ) yāvac ca Pāṭaliputram antarān nausaṃkramo 'vasthāpitaḥ, {%thinking, ‘he will come by boat,’ established a boat-course from Mathurā as far as Pāṭaliputra%}. Not only is this a long distance for a ‘bridge of boats’, but in line 12, as a result of this arrangement, Upagupta {%mounts on a ship%} (nāvam abhiruhya) and proceeds to Pāṭaliputra. Here, at least, the <ab>mg.</ab> seems then to be {%course for boats, water-way, navigable passage for ships%}; and this is possible in all the other passages.
