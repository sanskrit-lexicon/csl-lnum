{@chandaka@}¦, ({@1@}) <lex>nt.</lex> (= <lang>Pali</lang> <ab>id.</ab>; from chanda plus ka; see also {@chanda-yācaka@}), {%‘free-will offering’, general collection of alms%} for the community of monks, made by going the rounds of the town and inviting subscriptions from all citizens (<ls>Av</ls> 〔ii.39.4 ff.〕 describes this); chandakāni <ls>Av</ls> 〔i.269.9〕; otherwise only {@chandaka-bhikṣaṇa@} (<lex>nt.</lex>) in same <ab>mg.</ab>, <ls>MSV</ls> 〔i.61.19〕; 〔ii.77.15〕; <ls>Av</ls> 〔i.257.8, 11〕; 〔313.9〕; 〔314.2, 4〕; 〔317.16〕; 〔ii.39.4 ff.〕; in 〔i.264.2〕 (see <ls>Speyerʼs Index</ls>) read chandaka-(<ab>ed.</ab> chandana)-bhikṣaṇa (<ab>ms.</ab> and <ab>ed.</ab> bhikṣa; but the missing -ṇa is read in line 7 below); ({@2@}) in <ls>Av</ls> 〔ii.55.3〕 … indriyair avikalatvasya kuśaladharmachandakasya āścaryādbhuto loke prādurbhāvaḥ, <ls>Speyer, Index</ls>, renders -chandaka by {%gathering%} (of merit); but <ab>cf.</ab> <lang>Pali</lang> dhamma-chanda, {%desire for the Law%}, <ab>opp.</ab> to kāmachanda, {%desire for lusts%}; this is certainly the word involved; either chandaka = chanda (ka svārthe), or, perhaps better, read -chandatvasya, which matches the preceding series of nouns in -tva-sya, {%the appearance in the world of a state of desiring meritorious%} (or, {%felicitous%}) {%dharma%} (Law, or states of being ?) {%is a prodigious marvel%}; ({@3@}) in <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔2225〕 text tīvreṇa chandakaḥ, presumably <lex>adj.</lex>, {%desiring (vehemently)%}; but <ab>v.l.</ab> chandena, and so <ls>Mironov</ls> without <ab>v.l.</ab> (also Index of <ed>Kyoto ed.</ed> lists this reference under chanda, not under chandaka); this is <ab>prob.</ab> the true reading: {%with vehement desire%} ({@chanda@}); ({@4@}) <ab>n.</ab> of the Bodhisattvaʼs charioteer (in <lang>Pali</lang> Channa; here rarely {@Chanda@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>); sometimes even when the meter seems to demand Chanda, Chandaka is written, as in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.154.9〕; this is the regular form in prose and <ab>vs</ab>; <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.154.5〕 (prose), 6, 9; 〔155.14〕; 〔ii.25.12〕 (prose); 〔114.5〕 (prose); 〔159.12 ff.〕; 〔189.1 ff.〕; 〔iii.91.7〕; 〔262.8〕; <ls>LV</ls> 〔94.13〕; 〔95.10〕; 〔123.8〕; 〔210.3 ff.〕; 〔228.17 ff.〕; 〔237.18〕; <ls>Divy</ls> 〔391.22〕; sent with Kālodāyin by Śuddhodana as messenger to Buddha after his enlightenment, <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.233.11 ff.〕
