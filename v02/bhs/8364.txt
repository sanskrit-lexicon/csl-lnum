? {@nirgarati@}¦, perhaps rather nirgalati, {%spits out%}: <ls>LV</ls> 〔306.21〕 (prose) nirgaranto; but best <ab>mss.</ab> nirgalanto; object ayoguḍāni, {%spitting forth%}. <ab>Cf.</ab> <ls>BR</ls> <ab>s.v.</ab> gal plus nis, nirgalitāmbugarbhaṃ śaradghanam <ls>Ragh.</ls> 〔5.17〕, which could very well mean {%an autumn cloud that has ejected its water-content%}. On the other hand, nirgīrṇa is recorded in <ls>BR</ls> once from <ls>Rām.</ls> Neither nir-gṝ nor nir-gal seems recorded otherwise, in <lang>Skt.</lang> or <lang>MIndic</lang>. Since galati is the regular present to gal, it seems more likely that the best <ab>mss.</ab> of <ls>LV</ls> have the true form, nirgalanto.
