{@mātāpitṛ@}¦, <ab>sg.</ab> or <ab>pl.</ab> (not otherwise noted in this sense), {%family, relatives, ‘home-folks’%}: (a king has granted a wish to a courtesan, his concubine; she replies) <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.348.16—17〕 mahārāja yāvatā khu mātāpitaraṃ āpṛcchāmi tato devasya sakāśāto varaṃ yācayiṣyāmi. tāye mātāpitṝṇāṃ ārocitam.

On this basis I think it likely that in <ls>LV</ls> 〔279.11〕 mātāpitṛsaṃjñino means {%regarding%} (each other) {%as members of the same family%}: (sarvasattvāś ca tasmin samaye maitracittā hitacittāḥ) parasparaṃ mātā° 'bhūvan. <ab>Cf.</ab> next.
