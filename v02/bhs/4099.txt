{@eḍaka-rajas@}¦ (= {@avi-rajas@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>), <ab>lit.</ab> {%sheep-speck%}, a small unit of matter; like avi-rajas <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔8195〕, it occurs <ls>LV</ls> 〔149.6〕 and <ls>Divy</ls> 〔645.11〕 in tabular lists of very small weights or measures; in all three, seven {@śaśa-rajāṃsi@} (<ab>q.v.</ab>) make one eḍaka-(avi-)r° and seven of these make one {@go-rajas@} (<ab>q.v.</ab>). <ab>Acc.</ab> to <ls>St. Julien</ls>, cited by <ls>Weber ISt.</ls> 〔8.436 note〕, the <ab>mg.</ab> is said by Hiuen Tsʼang and a <lang>Chin.</lang> <ab>transl.</ab> of <ls>LV</ls> to be {%a grain of dust on the hide of a hare (sheep, beeve)%}. But <lang>Tib.</lang> on both <ls>Mvy</ls> and <ls>LV</ls> says simply {%hare- (sheep-, cow-)speck%} (<tib>rdul</tib>); to be sure, <ls>Das</ls> <ab>s.v.</ab> <tib>rdul</tib> declares that <tib>glaṅ rdul</tib> means {%a mote in the dung of an ox, a small particle of cowdung%}. But this, as well as the different guess from <lang>Chin.</lang>, can hardly be anything but implausible guesswork. Why should a speck on the skin, or in the dung, of an animal vary with the size of the animal? The <lang>Tib.</lang> itself gives no such indication. It seems safe to assume that {%hare-speck, sheep-speck%}, and {%cow-speck%} mean only three different sizes of small particles.
