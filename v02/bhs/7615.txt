{@dvādaśavargīya@}¦, <lex>f.</lex> {@°yā@}, <ab>pl.</ab>, {%belonging to a group of twelve%} (nuns; clearly not {%heretics%} as stated in Index): °yābhiḥ śrutam <ls>Divy</ls> 〔493.12〕; °yābhir 〔495.23〕. No such group has been discovered in <lang>Pali</lang>; the context in <ls>Divy</ls> is my only source of knowledge of the meaning. It can hardly mean {%members of the dvādaśavarga%}, <ab>q.v.</ab>, in the sense of {%quorum for ordination%}. Apparently these nuns were given to cavilling and trouble-making; they object to functions assigned to (Cūḍa-)Panthaka.
