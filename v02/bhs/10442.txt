? {@-pramuktaka@}¦, presumably = <lang>Skt.</lang> °kta, {%discharged%}: (sarvaratna)-paṅktirucirasūkṣma-kusuma-reṇu-pramuktakān <ls>Gv</ls> 〔100.12〕 (prose); so text, but there is something wrong with it; it occurs in a long series of <lex>acc.</lex> <lex>nt.</lex> or <lex>m.</lex> epithets, mostly ending -aṃ, applied to a park (udyānaṃ, line 11). The following word begins with s-, so the form could only be <lex>acc.</lex> <ab>pl.</ab> <lex>m.</lex>, which makes no sense. It would be unsatisfactory to <ab>em.</ab> to °kaṃ; I have no suggestion.
