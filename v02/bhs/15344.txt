{@śvasā@}¦, <ab>n. sg.</ab>, {%mother-in-law%}: <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔3894〕 = <lang>Tib.</lang> <tib>sgyug mo</tib>. Evidently for <lang>Skt.</lang> śvaśrū with ending modified by that of svasā (svasṛ), {%sister%}; <lang>MIndic</lang> forms of the two words resemble each other more closely, <ab>cf.</ab> <lang>Pkt.</lang> sussū with susā, {%sister%}. <ls>Mironov</ls> reads svasā in <ls>Mvy</ls>; but the <ab>mg.</ab> is certainly {%mother-in-law%}, as shown not only by <lang>Tib.</lang> but by the position of the word, after śvaśura.
