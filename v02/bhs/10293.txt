<hom>1</hom> {@pratyuddhārya@}¦, <lex>adj.</lex> (<lex>gdve.</lex> to °dharati, or <lex>adj.</lex> to °dhāra), in a-pra°, {%that is not to be restored or taken back%}: apratyuddhāryam asya (<ls>Bhīk</ls> asyā) bhavati śrāmaṇyam <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔9133〕; <ls>Bhīk</ls> 〔23b.5〕, {%not to be restored is his monkhood (her nunhood)%}, of a person permanently expelled; apratyuddhārya-paribhogaḥ <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔8493〕, {%use of%} (a gift once given or promised) {%which ought not to be taken back%}; so <lang>Tib.</lang> <tib>phyir ma blaṅs</tib> (or <tib>slaṅs</tib>, a form of which is used in <lang>Tib.</lang> version of 〔9133〕 above) <tib>par spyod pa</tib>; <lang>Chin.</lang> {%using again after giving trickily%}. The form in °-rya-might perhaps be interpreted as a gerund, see next; it is certainly so used in <ls>Prāt</ls> 〔519.5〕; but the <ab>corresp.</ab> <lang>Pali</lang>, <ls>Vin.</ls> 〔iv.121.16, 19, 22, 31〕; 〔122.17 ff.〕, has an <lex>adj.</lex> apaccuddhāraka (and in 〔122.21 ff.〕 paccuddhāraka), which means {%that ought not (ought) to be taken back%}; applied to a monkʼs robe, as in <ls>Prāt</ls>; misinterpreted even in <ls>CPD</ls>. The old <ls>Vin. comm.</ls>, 〔iv.122.19—25〕, makes my interpretation unmistakably clear; note especially 24 paccuddhārake paccuddhārakasaññī, anāpatti, {%there is no offense in the case of a thing that may%} (properly) {%be resumed, when%} (the one who so acts) {%knows that it is%}; <ab>cf.</ab> 17—18 which explains the circumstances under which it is apaccuddhāraka (implying that it is paccud° in other cases).
