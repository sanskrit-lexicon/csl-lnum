{@uttarika@}¦ (<lang>Pali</lang>, see below), in <ls>Śikṣ</ls> 〔332.1〕 (<ab>vs</ab>) ăjīvikadharma-carāṇāṃ uttarikāṇa anuttarikāṇāṃ, {%of Ājīvika-sectarians, superior and not superior(?)%}; <ab>acc.</ab> to <ls>Bendall and Rouse, Transl.</ls>, {%those who have or those who have not the higher aim%}, which is hardly illuminating. See <ls>Bendallʼs note</ls> in Text 〔p. 414〕 for report of a <lang>Chin.</lang> interpretation, for which I find no basis in Indic. In <lang>Pali</lang> uttarika is reported only <ls>Nett.</ls> 〔50.10〕 °kānaṃ phalānaṃ pattiyā; obviously {%superior%} or the like. <lang>Pali</lang> has no anuttarika.
