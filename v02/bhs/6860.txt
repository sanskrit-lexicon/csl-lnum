[? {@tam-enaṃ@}¦, <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.11.7, 11〕 (<ab>vss</ab>), assumed by <ls>Senart</ls> to be adverbial phrase, {%thereupon, straightway%}, and identified with <lang>Pali</lang> taṃ enaṃ, <ls>Vin.</ls> 〔i.127.32〕, which is so interpreted <ls>PTSD</ls> <ab>s.v.</ab> ta-, 〔II.4(b)〕; neither <ls>Senart</ls>ʼs nor <ls>PTSD</ls>ʼs explanation seems plausible. It seems to me that <lex>acc.</lex> <ab>sg.</ab> <lex>m.</lex> pronouns may quite well be intended; if <ls>Senart</ls> is right in his <ab>em.</ab> of the rest of the text, 〔i.11.7〕 would read: tam enaṃ kṛṣṇaprāṇakā agnitīkṣṇamukhā kharā, chaviṃ bhittvāna khādanti …, {%him … they eat, cutting his skin%}; and similarly line 11 where tam enaṃ may depend on khādanti in line 12. In the <lang>Pali</lang> passage, also, I believe pronouns are to be assumed, anticipating taṃ bhikkhuṃ of the next line, <ab>altho</ab> the construction is indeed exceptionally loose.]
