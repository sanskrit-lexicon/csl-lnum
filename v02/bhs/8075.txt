{@namati@}¦, in <ls>LV</ls> 〔259.21〕 (<ab>vs</ab>) said by <ls>Foucaux</ls> to mean {%arise, get up%}, and vinamate, {%sit down%}. But I think the <ab>mgs.</ab> of both are close to or identical with those of normal <lang>Skt.</lang> Line 20 reads, na ca iñjate bhramati vā dhyāyaty āsphānakaṃ dhyānaṃ, {%and he does not stir nor swerve, he practises the āsph° dhyāna%}; then 21, na ca namati no vinamate na kāyaparirakṣaṇā spṛśati, {%and he does not bend%} (to one side?) {%nor stoop down …%} On the other hand, namati is used as in <lang>Pali</lang> (apparently not in <lang>Skt.</lang> so far as recorded) with object cittaṃ, {%bends, inclines the mind, thought%}, with <lex>loc.</lex> (<lex>dat.</lex>), {%towards …%}; see {@nāmayati@}, also used similarly: pravrajyāyai (so <ls>Senart</ls>, but °ye, which might be <lex>loc.</lex>, is just as plausible; <ab>mss.</ab> °āryeś, °āyaiś) cittaṃ name (<lex>aor.</lex>) <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.322.20〕; <lex>ppp.</lex>, pāṃśukūle cittaṃ nataṃ <ls>LV</ls> 〔266.3〕.
