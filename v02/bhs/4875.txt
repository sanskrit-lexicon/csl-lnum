{@kiyat-@}¦ in <ab>comp.</ab>, in interrogative-exclamatory function (in <lang>Skt.</lang> only with pejorative connotation, = {%very little%}), with complimentary, or at least (when prefixed to a word in itself uncomplimentary) augmentative force, = {%exceedingly, in high degree%}: <ls>LV</ls> 〔158.2〕 (<ab>vs</ab>) kiyad-vibhūṣito bālaḥ pāpacārī na śobhate, (even) {%highly adorned, a foolish evil-doer does not shine%}; <ab>foll.</ab> by api, <ls>Śikṣ</ls> 〔130.1〕 kiyatpraṇītam api bhojanam, {%even very fine (? however fine) food%}; 〔130.11〕 kiyal-lūhenāpi bhojanena, {%even with very poor food%}; 〔151.5〕 kiyad-dhīnānām api sattvānām, {%even of extremely low creatures%}. <ls>Foucaux</ls> takes the <ls>LV</ls> passage as having indefinite kiyat-; even when the <ab>cpd.</ab> beginning with kiyat- is followed by api, as in the <ls>Śikṣ</ls> passages, it can hardly be taken as the indefinitizing api. <ls>PTSD</ls> interprets <lang>Pali</lang> kīvat as indefinite in <ls>Sn</ls> 〔959〕, but this is an error; it is interrogative (-exclamatory). <ab>Cf.</ab> next.
