{@sujāta-jāta@}¦, <lex>adj.</lex>, in <ls>LV</ls> 〔77.16〕 (prose) {%agreeable%}, of sounds: °ta-śabdāś ca śrūyante sma, {%and%} (only) {%agreeable sounds were heard%}; so <lang>Tib.</lang>, <tib>sgra skad sñan baḥi sgra dag kyaṅ</tib>; contrasting with ill-omened sounds (as of crows, jackals, <ab>etc.</ab>) just mentioned as abolished; here there can be no doubt of the <ab>mg.</ab> <ab>Cf.</ab> <lang>Pali</lang> <ls>Sn</ls> 〔548〕 paripuṇṇakāyo suruci sujāto cārudassano (of the Buddha). Perhaps in the same <ab>mg.</ab> sujātajātaḥ <ls>LV</ls> 〔112.12〕 (prose), in a list of epithets of Śākyamuni, {%agreeable%} (but <lang>Tib.</lang> here <tib>legs par skye bas skyes pa</tib>, quite literally, {%born by a good birth%}). <ab>Perh.</ab> also in <ls>LV</ls> 〔96.6〕; here, after the Bodhisattvaʼs birth, (apsarases) bodhisattvamātaram upasaṃkramya sujātajāta-tām aklāntakāyatāṃ ca paripṛcchanti sma (<ls>Lefm.</ls> sujātajāte tām, but read with <ab>v.l.</ab> as above, and so in repetitions 8, 10, 12, 14); this, it seems, in view of the parallels, may well mean {%approached … and inquired as to her agreeable%} (physical) {%condition and state of having an unwearied body%}, despite <lang>Tib.</lang> <tib>bltams pa legs par bltam mam</tib>, <ab>lit.</ab> {%well-born born state%}, which <ls>Foucaux</ls>, not unnaturally, takes to refer to successful parturition; yet the <lang>BHS</lang> (with -jāta, not jāti) hardly supports this.
