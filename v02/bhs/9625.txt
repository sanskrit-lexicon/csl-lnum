Often misunderstood; further evidence supporting the interpretation here given will be found below. <lang>Tib.</lang> (on <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔10〕, <ls>LV</ls> 〔3.4〕 <ab>etc.</ab>) <tib>skyes bu ḥdul baḥi</tib> ({%of human [to-be-] tamed ones%}, more <ab>lit.</ab> {%of [to-be-] tamed men%}) <tib>kha lo (b)sgyur ba</tib> ({%helm-governor = charioteer%}).
