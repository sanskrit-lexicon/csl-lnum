{@Tantrī@}¦, <ab>n.</ab> of a daughter of Māra <ab>acc.</ab> to <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.281.15〕; 〔283.15〕; 〔284.3〕; 〔286.6〕. The <ls>Mv</ls> is clearly secondary here; <ab>thru</ab>out most of the passage it mentions only two daughters of Māra, Tantrī and Arati, but in 〔286.6〕 three, the third being Rati. Originally (<ls>LV</ls> 〔378.4 ff.〕; <lang>Pali</lang>, see <ls>Childers</ls> <ab>s.v.</ab> Ragā) there were three, Tṛṣṇā, Arati, and Rati (or, in <lang>Pali</lang>, Ragā, <ls>SN</ls> 〔i.124.15 ff.〕). It is clear that <ls>Mv</ls> replaces Tṛṣṇā by Tantrī. Could it be a corruption of <lang>MIndic</lang> *Taṇhī = <lang>BHS</lang> {@tṛṣṇī@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>? Or is the corruption based on some form of the numeral for {%three%} (which is lost in <ls>Mv</ls> except in the final verse), <ab>cf.</ab> tās tisro … <ls>LV</ls> 〔378.4〕 ?
