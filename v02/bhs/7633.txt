? {@dvipari@}¦ (-vartanāveṇī), <ls>LV</ls> 〔256.1〕. If we accept dvipari- with all <ab>mss.</ab> and both <ab>edd.</ab> we should have to understand it as part of the <ab>foll.</ab> <ab>cpd.</ab>; in that case apparently parivartanā = vartanā, and with preceding dvi- the whole might mean {%string of double beads%} (<ab>lit.</ab> {%spheres?%}), <ab>i.e.</ab>, [Page274-b] possibly, extra-large ones? See the whole passage cited <ab>s.v.</ab> {@vartanā(veṇī)@}. Note however that the close parallel <ls>LV</ls> 〔254.13〕 lacks dvipari; and <lang>Tib.</lang> on 〔256.1〕 has nothing corresponding. Note also that the preceding comparison, ending pārśve (and cited <ab>l. c.</ab>), lacks any statement of the tertium comparationis between the Bodhisattvaʼs sides (pārśve) and the ‘ribs’ of a crab or the roof-frame of a (ruined) stable; 〔254.10—11〕 shows the point, <ab>viz.</ab> that they were ‘open’, so that light shone <ab>thru</ab>. Is it possible that dvipari goes with the preceding and contains a corruption of some form of vi-var-(<ab>cf.</ab> vivṛtāyāṃ 〔254.10〕)? Something like <lex>opt.</lex> vivare(t), vivari? The passage is prose, and <lang>MIndic</lang> forms are not normal in prose of <ls>LV</ls>; but no one knows how <lang>MIndic</lang> its original form may have been.
