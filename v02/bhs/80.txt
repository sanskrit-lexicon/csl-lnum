{@akṣudrāvakāśa@}¦ (= <lang>Pali</lang> akkhuddāvakāsa), {%of fine (not inferior) appearance%}. Almost always follows prāsādika and darśanīya; all virtual synonyms, applied to women and less often to men and children: <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.196.20〕; 〔352.15〕; 〔ii.422.1, 7〕 (boy); 〔432.14〕; 〔iii.35.18〕 (man); 〔153.16〕 (here prāsādika is lacking); 〔218.11〕; 〔377.12〕; 〔404.17〕 (an infant boy). In <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.197.16〕 (not accompanied by the other <lex>adj.</lex>) said of the family (kulam) in which a Bodhisattva is born; but perhaps this is an erroneous reading, or if correct means rather {%possessing no small scope, range, sphere of activity or opportunity%} (with the meaning of {@avakāśa@} normal in <lang>Skt.</lang>, <lang>Pali</lang>, and <lang>BHS</lang>). This latter, at least, is clearly meant by <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.1.7〕, a parallel passage, which reads akṣudrāvacaraṃ instead of this. A third parallel, <ls>LV</ls> 〔23.12〕, reads akṣudrānupaghāti, which surely means {%not petty and not injurious%} (so <lang>Tib.</lang>, <tib>phran tshegs med ciṅ gnod par byed pa med pa yin</tib>), not {%<fr>ne frappe pas ceux qui ne sont pas méchants</fr>%} (<ls>Foucaux</ls>).
