{@kapāṭa@}¦, in <ls>LV</ls> 〔376.13〕 (<ab>vs</ab>), to be read approximately: nīvaraṇa-kapāṭāś ca pañca mayehā pradāritā sarve, <ab>perh.</ab> {%all the five doors%} (gates, as obstacles) {%of the hindrances have been cleft by me here%}. Note however that <lang>AMg.</lang> kavāḍa = kapāṭa is a homonym of kavāḍa = kapāla; I suspect that the latter is really meant here (falsely <ab>Sktized</ab>), in some such sense as {%hard shells%}.
