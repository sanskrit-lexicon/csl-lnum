{@buddha-kṣetra@}¦, <lex>nt.</lex> (= <lang>Pali</lang>, late, °khetta), {%Buddha-field, region or%} (usually) {%world%} or {%world-system%} in which a particular Buddha lives and operates; see <ls>Teresina Rowell, ‘The background and early use of the Buddhakṣetra concept,’ The Eastern Buddhist</ls> 〔6.199—430〕 and 〔7.131—176〕, where the term is ably discussed; a few out of many occurrences are here recorded: descriptions of a b°, <ls>SP</ls> 〔65.9 ff.〕; 〔144.9 ff.〕; its ‘jewels’ are Bodhisattvas <ls>SP</ls> 〔66.3〕; in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.301.16〕 Bodhisattvas in numberless b° take the form of gods and come to Śākyamuni as he is about to become enlightened; <ab>misc.</ab>, <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔3065〕; <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.319.11〕; 〔349.17〕; 〔iii.139.3〕; 〔342.1〕; in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.123.4 ff.〕 enumeration of some ‘present’ Buddha-fields and their Buddhas; huddhakṣetraṃ viśodhenti bodhisattvā(ḥ) <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.283.3〕; atuliya (so <ab>mss.</ab>) aprameyaṃ °traṃ aparimitaṃ bharitvā ({%having filled%}) sameti (= śamayati) khila-doṣa-mohaṃ (so read, see <ab>s.v.</ab> {@khila@}) <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.295.9〕; on {%‘emptying’%} of buddha-fields, see <ab>s.v.</ab> {@riñcati@}; in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.121.14 ff.〕 the question is asked whether Buddhas are produced in all Buddha-fields, and the answer, 〔122.2—3〕, is negative; in many there is no Buddha; <ls>Śikṣ</ls> 〔147.15〕 speaks of going to a buddhaśūnyabuddhakṣetram as an evil fate; so in <ls>SP</ls> 〔68.2〕 (<ab>vs</ab>; <ab>cf.</ab> 〔66.3 ff.〕, prose, same subject) buddhakṣetra is clearly equated with {@lokadhātu@}, meaning merely {%world-system%}, presumably as {%potential field for a Buddha%}, but not necessarily containing one; on this see <ls>Rowell</ls>, <ab>op. cit.</ab>, 〔415〕.
