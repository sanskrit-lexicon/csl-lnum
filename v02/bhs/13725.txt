{@vi(c)chandayati@}¦, for which forms of vi-chind- occur [Page484-b] in <ab>mss.</ab>, <ab>cf.</ab> also {@vicchindika@} and <ab>prec.</ab>; see <ls>Wogihara, Lex.</ls> (<ab>mss.</ab> vary in <ls>Bbh</ls> between a and i); in <lang>Pali</lang> (kāya-)vicchinda occurs as title of <ls>Jāt.</ls> 〔293〕, surely meaning {%aversion from the body%}, not {%cutting off of …%}; in <ls>Pv. comm.</ls> 〔129.26〕 atidānato vicchinditukāmo clearly means {%wanting to dissuade from over-generosity%}, = <lang>BHS</lang> vi-chand-; <lang>Pali</lang> (kāya-)vicchandaniya(-kathā) and (kāya-)vicchandanika- (-sutta) cannot be separated from (kāya-)vicchinda, above; in <ls>Divy</ls> 〔590.24〕 even the <ab>v.l.</ab> vicchedayām āsuḥ occurs for vicchandayām āsuḥ. It is clear that <lang>Pali</lang> and <lang>BHS</lang> both show what must, therefore, be a very old confusion between chand- and -chi(n)d- here. As <ls>Kern</ls> (cited <ls>PTSD</ls> <ab>s.v.</ab> vicchinda), <ls>Wogihara</ls>, and some others have seen, the <ab>orig.</ab> form was surely {@vicchandayati@}; the forms with chi(n)d- are due to popular <ab>etym.</ab> (in some occurrences the word means something close to {%cuts off%}). The fundamental <ab>mg.</ab> is {%makes undesirous%} (<lex>denom.</lex>, vi plus chanda); so <lang>Tib.</lang> <tib>mos pa zlog pa</tib> on <ls>Mvy</ls>, <tib>ḥdun pa zlog</tib> on <ls>KP</ls>, both <ab>mg.</ab> {%desire-deterring, desire-dissuading%}, but on <ls>LV</ls> simply <tib>zlog par byed pa</tib>, {%dissuasion-(deterring-)making%}: °dayati <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔6527〕, <ab>foll.</ab> by vicakṣuḥ-karaṇāya; bhūyobhūyaḥ sa māṃ °dayati, bhadramukhāniṣṭo 'sya karmaṇo phalavipākaḥ <ls>Divy</ls> 〔10.6〕, similarly 〔11.24〕, {%dissuades%}; °dayām āsuḥ (<ab>v.l.</ab> see above) 〔590.24〕; (Māraḥ …) bodhisattvaṃ … evaṃ °dayiṣyati <ls>AsP</ls> 〔331.16〕, {%will (try to) dissuade%}; (iha … bodhisattvasya … pāpamitraṃ, yaḥ prajñāpāramitāyāṃ) carantaṃ virecayati (<ab>q.v.</ab>) vichandayati <ls>ŚsP</ls> 〔1185.19〕, modulated in the sequel (the means of dissuasion are given 〔1186.1 ff.〕; they consist of attacks on the dogmatic interpretation of Buddhism accepted in this school); (devaputrāḥ … Māraṃ …) vicchandayanti <ls>LV</ls> 〔333.20〕 and 〔335.10〕 (prose), {%dissuade, discourage Māra%} (by predicting his defeat); °dayati vikṣipati <ls>KP</ls> 〔1.6〕; when the thing dissuaded from is expressed it is regularly <lex>abl.</lex>, dānād vicchandayan <ls>Jm</ls> 〔24.7〕; (saṃgrahavastubhyo) vicchandya <ls>Śikṣ</ls> 〔50.12〕; adattādānād °dayati <ls>Gv</ls> 〔155.15〕; vichandya (<ab>v.l.</ab> vichindya) with ablatives <ls>Bbh</ls> 〔16.2 ff.〕, so also °dayet 〔27.12〕; °dayati (<ab>v.l.</ab> °chind°) 〔262.13〕; but once apparently <lex>acc.</lex>, (yasmāt tvaṃ bhikṣucaraṇapranāmaṃ) māṃ °dayitum icchasi <ls>Divy</ls> 〔383.6〕, {%since you wish to dissuade me%} (against, from) {%bowing at the feet of monks%} (or is this <lex>acc.</lex> a <ab>Bhvr.</ab> <lex>adj.</lex>, {%me characterized by bowing%} <ab>etc.</ab>?).
