{@saṃpratigrāhin@}¦, <lex>adj.</lex> or <ab>n. ag.</ab> (to <lang>Skt.</lang> saṃ-pratigrah- with -in; <ab>cf.</ab> <ab>prec.</ab>), {%accepting, one who accepts%}: taṃ nūnam agrasattvo hy agrāhuti-°hī <ls>LV</ls> 〔316.8〕 (<ab>vs</ab>), <ab>prob.</ab> {%therefore surely the Supreme Being is accepting the supreme offering%}. So <ls>Lefm.</ls> implies, by printing °huti-saṃ° as one word. In <ls>JAOS</ls> 〔57.22〕 I took the form as an <lex>aor.</lex> of °grāhayati (which is not recorded), in the <ab>mg.</ab> of °gṛhṇāti; this still seems to me possible, but I now prefer the interpretation given above.
