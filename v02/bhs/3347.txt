<L>3347<pc>122,1<k1>utkzepalipi<k2>utkzepa-lipi
{@utkṣepa-lipi@}¦, <ab>n.</ab> of a kind of script: <ls>LV</ls> 〔126.5〕; followed by {@nikṣepa°, vikṣepa°@}, and (6) {@prakṣepa-lipi@}; also, line 7, utkṣepāvarta-lipi, and (in some <ab>mss.</ab>, supported by <lang>Tib.</lang>) nikṣepāvarta-lipi. All these terms seem to be intended to refer to the shape of the letters, rather than to the countries where they are used. It is hardly possible to guess what the author meant by them, and the woodenly literal <lang>Tib.</lang> translations give little help; <lang>Tib.</lang> renders utkṣepa, <tib>gdeg pa</tib>, {%elevation%} (and āvarta, <tib>skor ba</tib>, {%turn%}); nikṣepa, <tib>bzhag pa</tib> or <tib>bzhog pa</tib>, {%putting down%}; vikṣepa (which <lang>Tib.</lang> transposes to the point in line 6 where <ls>Lefm.</ls>ʼs [Page122-b] <ab>ms.</ab> A has it), <tib>rnam ḥthor</tib>, {%scattering%}; prakṣepa, <tib>bsnan pa</tib>, {%addition, increase%}.
