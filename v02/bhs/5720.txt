{@Giri@}¦, <ab>n.</ab> of a nāga king (<ab>cf.</ab> next): <ls>Māy</ls> 〔246.32〕. In <ls>LV</ls> 〔393.3〕 (<ab>vs</ab>) I am doubtful of -giri-, which seems to stand for a form of gir(ā), {%speech, words%}, and suggest <ab>em.</ab> to -gira-, <ab>m.c.</ab> for -girā, see <ab>prec.</ab> Text apagata-giri-vākpatho hy alipto, said of the Buddha: {%unstained, because beyond the range of speech in words%}; in <lang>Skt.</lang> (atīta-)vākpatha (not well defined in <ls>BR</ls>) means {%(beyond) the range of words, inexpressible, indescribable%}; some such meaning must be involved here. <ab>Mss.</ab> vākyatho, but <lang>Tib.</lang>, otherwise not clear, confirms a form of -path(a): <tib>tshig bral dag gi lam</tib> (= {%way%}) <tib>gyis</tib> (<lex>inst.</lex>; does this point to a reading -pathā?) <tib>mi gos pa</tib>, which seems to mean {%not stained by the way of those deprived of speech%}. But <ed>Calc.</ed> and <ls>Foucaux</ls> understand apagatagiri as a separate word (<lex>loc.</lex> absolute), which may be right.
