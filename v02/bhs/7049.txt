{@telā@}¦, a high number: <ls>Gv</ls> 〔106.9〕. <ab>Cf.</ab> <ab>prec.</ab>, and {@bhelā@}, which occurs in the same context with this. There are three sets of numbers in -el- preceded by various consonants; in one set the stem-vowel a is added, in another ā, in another u. The t- and bh-forms of <ls>Mvy</ls> seem duplications of each other, but both appear in one <ls>Gv</ls> version (〔106.9 and 11〕), <ab>viz.</ab> the one ending in ā.
