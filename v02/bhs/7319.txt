{@diśi@}¦ (= <lang>AMg.</lang> disi, for <lang>Skt.</lang> diś, diśā; not in <lang>Pali</lang>), {%direction%}. Noted only in <ls>Mmk</ls>, but not rare there; usually <lex>acc.</lex> <ab>sg.</ab> diśim; sometimes (notably 〔205.26〕, where it seems clearly to be taken so, 〔§ 4.59〕, end) this could be interpreted as <lex>loc.</lex> diśi plus ‘hiatus-bridging’ m; among the cases which are certainly <lex>acc.</lex> are: dakṣiṇāṃ diśim āśritāḥ <ls>Mmk</ls> 〔326.18〕, and … āśritya 〔626.26〕; prāciṃ (°cīṃ) diśim upādāya 〔620.1〕 (these all <ab>vss</ab>). The great corruption of the text of <ls>Mmk</ls> might tempt to emendation (diśam would be easy), but <lang>AMg.</lang> seems to confirm the form.
