{@mahāyaśākhya@}¦, <lex>adj.</lex>, = {@maheśākhya@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>, <ls>Śikṣ</ls> 〔303.11〕 (<ab>vs</ab>; meter correct). Is this only a hyper-<ab>Sktism</ab>, or does it give a clue to the real etymology of maheśākhya and <lang>Pali</lang> mahesakkha? {%Having a very glorious name%} fits the word at least as well, and is in my opinion at least as plausible etymologically, as the traditional (but rather mechanical) analysis mahā plus īśa plus ākhyā.
