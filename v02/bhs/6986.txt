I suspect a corruption, and cannot explain the text as it stands any more than <ls>Senart</ls> (his doubtful suggestion based on <ls>LV</ls> <ed>Calc.</ed> 〔313.19〕 falls now with the reading of that text, which in <ls>Lefm.</ls> 〔250.1〕 is replaced by … tīrthyāḥ, {%heretics%}, kurvante). However, it is barely possible that this one <ls>Mv</ls> passage preserves the original neutral <ab>mg.</ab>, {%adherent%} (or {%founder%}) {%of%} (any) {%religion%}. A trace of this may also remain in the not infrequent prefixation of anya- to t°, {%other%} (than Buddhist) {%sectarian%}, <ls>LV</ls> 〔268.12〕; <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.49.12〕 (anyatīrthikapūrvo, {%formerly a member of another sect%}); 〔412.7〕; or {@para-t°@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>; <ab>cf.</ab> kutīrthikā(ḥ) <ls>LV</ls> 〔12.10〕, {%members of base%} (heretical) {%sects%}.
