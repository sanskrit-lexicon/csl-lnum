{@kṣaṇika@}¦, <lex>adj.</lex>, {%empty%} (of the hands): read in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.252.14〕 kṣaṇikena (<ls>Senart</ls> °tena with 1 <ab>ms.</ab>, <ab>v.l.</ab> kṣamikena) hastena gṛhaṃ gacchati, hato bhavati, {%went home empty-handed and was depressed%} (of a fowler who caught no birds); 〔iii.171.6〕, read svakaṃ ca hastaṃ kṣaṇikaṃ (so 1 <ab>ms.</ab>, <ab>v.l.</ab> kṣeṇikaṃ; <ls>Senart</ls> <ab>em.</ab> implausibly) paśyati (having given away a beautiful lotus, and now regretting the gift); repeated 〔171.9〕. Is this an extension of the <ab>mg.</ab> of <lang>JM.</lang> khaṇika, {%idle, unemployed, out of work%} (which is itself derived from <lang>Skt.</lang> kṣaṇin, {%at leisure%})?
