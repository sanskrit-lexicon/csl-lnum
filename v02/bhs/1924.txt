{@ar(t)tiyati@} or {@°tīyati, °te@}¦; in one doubtful passage perhaps ārtī°, otherwise always art° when not fused in saṃdhi with preceding vowel; forms occurring include ar(t)tīyati, °yanti, °tīyate, °tiyante, °tīyanto and °taṃ (<lex>pres. pple.</lex>), aritīyeran (! read art°), artita (<lex>ppp.</lex>); also ārtīyate (? <ab>v.l.</ab> attī°); attīyantā (and probably attīyate for <ab>prec.</ab>); ṛtīyate, °yante, °yamāna (<lex>pres. pple.</lex>; for ṛt° we usually find rit° written); ardīyamāna (<lex>pres. pple.</lex>); āstīryati; and noun {@attīyanā@}. The <ab>corresp.</ab> <lang>Pali</lang> (see <ls>CPD</ls>) is written aṭṭīyati, aṭṭhī°, aḍḍhī°, addiyati. Despite all this confusion, there is no doubt that we are dealing with essentially one word, with modifications due to diverse influences, including popular etymology and hyper-<ab>Sktism</ab>. <ls>Wogihara, ZDMG</ls> 〔58.454〕, gives the ‘correct form’ as ṛtīyate (which, or rather usually rit°, is customary in <ls>Bbh</ls>, but I believe occurs nowhere else), and the <ab>mg.</ab> as {%<ger>er schämt sich</ger>%}; both statements are wrong, I believe. As to <ab>mg.</ab>, <ls>Wogihara</ls> was evidently influenced by the fact that the word is often associated in <lang>Pali</lang> with harāyati, jigucchati, and in <lang>BHS</lang> with jehrīyate, (vi)jugupsati, or equivalents. But it is also often used where {%shame%} cannot be involved. Most likely the <lang>MIndic</lang> word is a denominative from ārti (for which arti, with semi-<lang>MIndic</lang> shortening, is recorded even in <lang>Skt.</lang>). All forms are included here since the word is clearly a unit, but they are also entered under the several heading: ({@1@}) {%is grieved, perturbed, distressed%}: <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.219.17〕 = 〔ii.21.19〕 kecit saṃsārapāśena arttiyante (〔ii.21.19〕 saṃsāracāreṇa artīyanti) yathā aham (said by the infant Bodhisattva), {%are distressed%}; <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.161.7〕 bodhisattvo jātīye arttīyanto, {%being pained by%} (or, {%on account of%}) {%birth%}, 11—12 … maraṇena artt°, 13 śokehi artt°; <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.242.13〕 arttīyati (<ls>Senart</ls> <ab>em.</ab> attī°); <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.89.18〕 (ākīrṇavihāreṇa) nārtīyanti; <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.480.7〕 śokārtita; <ls>LV</ls> 〔174.14〕 [Page066-b] jarārtita; <ls>Bbh</ls> 〔166.11〕 ṛtīyamānaḥ (of a Bodhisattva); <ls>Bbh</ls> 〔171.9〕 ritīyamānaṃ. ({@2@}) In some transitional cases, leading over to the next group, the additional note of {%aversion, revulsion%} seems more or less clearly present: <ls>Bbh</ls> 〔282.7—8〕 tena pūrvakeṇādhimokṣeṇāritīyeran (read °ṇārtīyeran; but in same phrase line 23 °mokṣeṇa ritīyante), {%they would be annoyed by, sick of, disgusted with their former enthusiasm%}; <ls>Bbh</ls> 〔168.23〕 ritīyate; <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔1830〕 nārtīyate (no context); ({@3@}) like preceding but accompanied by parallel forms of hrī-, jugups-, or the like: <ls>SP</ls> 〔108.6〕 daridracintayārtīyantaṃ jehrīyamāṇaṃ jugupsamānaṃ, {%distressed, ashamed, disgusted by the thought of being poor%}; <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.343.1〕 (tena adharmeṇa) attīyantā (<ls>Senart</ls> <ab>em.</ab> artī°) vijigupsantā or °satā (<ab>mss.</ab> °satāṃ, evidently <lex>pres. pple.</lex>, <ls>Senart</ls> <ab>em.</ab> wrongly °sitā) {%distressed and disgusted by this immorality%}; <ls>Karmav</ls> 〔47.26〕 āstīryati jihreti vigarhati vijugupsati, {%is distressed, ashamed, offended, disgusted%} (by acts he has done); 〔49.2〕; <ls>Divy</ls> 〔39.7〕 ye 'nena pūtikāyenārdīyamānā jehrīyante vijugupsamānāḥ, {%being distressed, are ashamed, disgusted%}; ({@4@}) with <lex>abl.</lex>, {%feels aversion%} (from): <ls>MadhK</ls> 〔297.2〕, text ārtīyate (ebhyo dharmebhyo), but <ab>v.l.</ab> attīyate, so <ab>prob.</ab> read; followed by jehrīyate vitarati vijugupsate; in line 4 below (see note 1) <ab>mss.</ab> dharmebhyo attīyanā (text artī°) vijugupsanā (nouns).
