{@tiryak@}¦, <lex>adv.</lex> (used in the sense of <lang>Pali</lang> tiro, <lang>BHS</lang> {@tiras, tiraskṛta@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>; the converse use of <lang>Skt.</lang> tiras in the sense of tiryak, {%crosswise%}, is recorded by <ls>BR</ls> <ab>s.v.</ab> 2a from lexicons, and once in <ls>Mārk. Pur.</ls>; but in this one passage it seems to me that tiras may have its <lang>Pali</lang> <ab>mg.</ab> of {%outside, away, afar%}), {%outside, away, afar%}, in contrast with iha; neha na tiryak nobhayam antarā <ls>Śikṣ</ls> 〔252.15〕, {%not here, not afar, not between the two%}. (<ls>Bendall and Rouse, Transl.</ls> 〔234 line 2〕, {%across%}; but this seems manifest nonsense in the context.)
