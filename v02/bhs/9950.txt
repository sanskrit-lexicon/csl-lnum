{@pratikrośa@}¦ (<lex>m.</lex>? to next; <ab>cf.</ab> <lang>Pali</lang> paṭikkosana), {%rejection, scorn, disregard%}: °śena <ls>AsP</ls> 〔179.6〕 (prose; refers to action of 〔179.4〕, see next); {%rejection of, opposition to%}, action in the saṃgha, <ls>MSV</ls> 〔ii.210.5, 9 ff.〕 In <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.371.10〕 (<ab>vs</ab>) <ls>Senart</ls> reads sukhito pramuditaḥ pratikrośaṃ pratilabhati purimanirodhadṛṣṭaṃ, and interprets prati° as [Page362-a] referring to the contempt and ill-treatment which pious men will accept with joy in the time of decadence of religion; but this does not seem a natural interpretation, and the <ab>mss.</ab> read, one, prītiḥ krośaṃ, the other pratikośaṃ; combining parts of each we would get prītikośaṃ, {%a treasure-store of joy%}, which makes good sense and which I would read. The meter is very puzzling to me in this whole passage, so that I cannot rely on it.
