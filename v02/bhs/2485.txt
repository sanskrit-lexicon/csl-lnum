{@asya@}¦, also {@sya@}, apparently particle of emphasis; <ab>acc.</ab> to <ls>Senart</ls> on <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.45.1〕, = <lang>Skt.</lang> svid, <lang>Pali</lang> su (also assu). (Note that <ls>PTSD</ls> <ab>s.v.</ab> su³ derives this not only from <lang>Skt.</lang> svid but also from <lang>Skt.</lang> sma, for which it there states that <lang>Pali</lang> also has sa and assa; but neither of these forms is cited in their proper places in <ls>PTSD</ls>; Andersen, Reader, Glossary <ab>s.v.</ab> sudaṃ, also mentions sa and assa as occurring for <lang>Skt.</lang> sma but does not list them; <ls>PTSD</ls> <ab>s.v.</ab> assu cites once assa as <ab>v.l.</ab> for assu; otherwise I have no record of <lang>Pali</lang> (as)sa as a particle.) In <ab>mss.</ab> of <ls>Mv</ls> anya or anyaṃ is sometimes read for asya: evam asya syāt <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.45.1, 5, 9, 12〕; kim asya nāma 〔i.343.4〕; tasya sya dharmā 〔i.292.1〕; kiṃ sya nāma, and kena sya nāma, 〔i.346.8〕 and 9, 15 and 16; 〔347.3〕.
