{@ṛtu-pariṇāma@} and {@ṛtu-vipariṇāma@}¦: <ab>cf.</ab> <lang>Pali</lang> utupariṇāma, {%change of season%}, as a source of disease, <ab>e.g.</ab> <ls>AN</ls> 〔ii.87.30—31〕 (vedayitāni …) utupariṇāma-jāni (<ab>comm.</ab> 〔iii.114.19〕 = utupariṇāmato atisīta-atiuṇha-ututo jātāni); ṛtupariṇāmāye, <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.15.6〕 (<ls>Senart</ls> wrongly), or ṛtuvipari° 〔ii.424.(3—)4〕, <ab>perh.</ab> <lex>adj.</lex> {%subject to change of season%}; or, <ab>prob.</ab> reading °nāma-tāye, {%because of change of season?%}; in vipācanīye grahaṇīye samanvāgatā nāpy atiśītāye nāpy atiuṣṇāye (〔424.3〕 na cāti° both times) ṛtu- (〔424.4〕 ṛtu-vi-)pariṇāmāye. A like passage <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.211.7〕 reads, instead of ṛtu(vi)pari°, in the <ab>mss.</ab> samāye cintamatāye (<ab>v.l.</ab> vinta°), which is obscure; <ls>Senart</ls> <ab>em.</ab> sammāpariṇāmāye, but this seems violent; samāye seems sound, as it occurs just before. <ls>Senart</ls> understands this as {%causing good digestion%}, and infers that ṛtu-pari° means the same. He does not mention 〔ii.424.3—4〕, which reads vipariṇāma; this, unlike pariṇāma, seems never to be used in <lang>Skt.</lang>, <lang>Pali</lang> or <lang>Pkt.</lang> in the sense of {%digestion%}; and the established <lang>Pali</lang> <ab>cpd.</ab> utu-pariṇāma certainly goes against <ls>Senart</ls>ʼs view. The only question is, can ṛtupariṇāmāye, <lex>fem.</lex>, be an <lex>adj.</lex> going with grahaṇīye, or should we take it as a noun? In the latter case an <ab>em.</ab> to °matāye seems probable.
