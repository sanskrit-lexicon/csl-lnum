[{@kārīṣi?@}¦ form and <ab>mg.</ab> doubtful, in refrain pāda: kārīṣi (so the <ab>mss.</ab> seem clearly to indicate; sometimes they read °ṣu, and other <ab>vv.ll.</ab>) dattvā jinacetiyeṣu <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.384.17〕, repeated 21, 〔385.3, 7, 11, 19, 23〕. A parallel <ab>vs</ab> occurring in the midst of these, 〔385.15〕, has (na) tailavinduṃ jinastūpe dattvā; and in a following <ab>vs</ab> 〔386.1〕 tailasya vinduṃ jinacetiyeṣu occurs. This suggests that possibly tālīśa (°śu, for °śaṃ?) should be read, = <lang>Pali</lang> tālīsa, tālissa, {%a ‘powder or ointment’%} (<ls>PTSD</ls>) made from the plant named in <lang>Skt.</lang> tālīśa; {@tālīśa@} occurs, perhaps in this <ab>mg.</ab> (associated with tailam), in <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔5787〕, see <ab>s.v.</ab> It seems at any rate appropriate; some oily substance used in decorating a caitya is indicated.]
