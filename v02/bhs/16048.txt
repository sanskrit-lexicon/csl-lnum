{@samādhyāyika-tā@}¦, said to mean {%acquisition%} or {%possession of samādhi%} (so <ls>Foucaux</ls>; <ls>Burnouf, Lotus</ls>, 〔798〕; and <ab>app.</ab> <lang>Tib.</lang> <tib>tiṅ ṅe ḥdzin sgrub par</tib>): <ls>LV</ls> 〔34.6〕 (prose) prītisaṃbodhyaṅgaṃ dharmālokamukhaṃ °katāyai saṃvartate. So both <ab>edd.</ab>, no <ab>v.l.</ab> But I do not understand the formation; if a <ab>cpd.</ab>, the second member *āyika(-tā) does not seem plausible ({%leading to%}, as if from ā plus root i?); nor can I make a plausible analysis by assuming suffixation, starting with samādhi; perhaps primary formation from <lang>Skt.</lang> samādhyāyati, instead of °dhyāyaka-, {%state of one that completely concentrates?%}
