{@kṣamaṇīya@}¦, <lex>adj.</lex> or <lex>subst.</lex> <lex>nt.</lex> (= <lang>Pali</lang> khamanīya, <ls>Vin.</ls> 〔i.59.10〕, also with yāpanīya), {%tolerable, endurable%} (condition): <ls>SP</ls> 〔429.4〕, see <ab>s.v.</ab> {@yāpanīya@}. Both this form and {@kṣemaṇīya(-tara@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>) are used in what is clearly the same locution, bracketed with yāpanīya; kṣam° is supported by <lang>Pali</lang> khamanīya, but {@kṣemaṇīya-pṛccha@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>, supports kṣem°. Etymologically both forms can be justified in a way, but kṣemaṇīya looks strange as a derivative of kṣema (premaṇīya is not a perfect parallel) and may be a blend of kṣamaṇīya with kṣema. Or is it a direct imitation of {@premaṇīya@}, a near-synonym?
