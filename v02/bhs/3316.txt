{@utkarṣayati@}¦ (<ab>cf.</ab> <ab>prec.</ab>; not in this sense <lang>Skt.</lang>; = <lang>Pali</lang> ukkaṃsati, °seti), {%exalts%}, <ab>i.e.</ab> {%praises%}: <lex>gdve.</lex>, <ls>Śikṣ</ls> 〔197.10〕 sacec cañcalendriyo (rājā) bhavati, utkarṣayitavyaṃ (<ab>sc.</ab> bhikṣuṇā), {%if%} (the king) {%is flighty%} (unstable), {%praise must be bestowed%} (saying: It is very meritorious on your part that your kingdom contains so many worthy monks and brahmans who live undisturbed by thieves <ab>etc.</ab>). <ab>Acc.</ab> to <ls>Bendall</ls>, <lang>Tib.</lang> has <tib>bstan par bya ḥo</tib>, and accordingly <ls>Transl.</ls> renders ‘the Brother should admonish him’ (more exactly, the <lang>Tib.</lang> means {%elucidate, make intelligible%}). But I do not see how the <lang>BHS</lang> word can mean this. The <ab>mg.</ab> of the <lang>Pali</lang> word is appropriate here; by encouraging flattery the king is to be strengthened in a good course.
