{@dhūmakālika@}¦ (<lang>Pali</lang> <ab>id.</ab>, see below; from <lang>Pali</lang> °kāla, {%death, destruction%}, <ls>Jāt.</ls> 〔iii.422.14〕, plus -ika), {%subject to destruction; destroyed, lost%}: (17—18 tīrthikā … krāyur, so <ab>mss.</ab> for <ls>Senart</ls> kreyur, apratimaśāsana-doṣaṃ) dhūmakālikam iti śramaṇasya, etad eva ca tu rakṣaṇīyatā (so with most <ab>mss.</ab>) <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.69.19—20〕 (<ab>vs</ab>), {%the heretics may do harm%} (or, {%cause enmity%}) {%to the matchless doctrine of the Monk (Buddha), saying that%} (iti) {%it is perishable (is now going to be destroyed); but this very thing is a state that we must guard against%} (<ls>Senart</ls> quite differently, ignoring iti); saṃgātavyam imaṃ vācyaṃ mā haiva (text °vaṃ) dhūmakālikaṃ <ls>Mmk</ls> 〔600.10〕 (<ab>vs</ab>), {%this text must be recited in unison, lest it be destroyed (lost)%}; °ka-tā, <ab>abstr.</ab>, (mā haiva pravacanaṃ kṛtsnaṃ …) dhūmakālikatāṃ vrajet <ls>Mmk</ls> 〔596.25〕 (<ab>vs</ab>), {%lest the whole Gospel become destroyed (lost)%}. This, I believe, is the <ab>mg.</ab> of the <lang>Pali</lang> word too; both the <lang>Pali</lang> <ab>comm.</ab> and modern interpreters misunderstand it. In <ls>Vin.</ls> 〔ii.288.20〕 (bhavissanti vattāro:) dhūmakālikaṃ samaṇena Gotamena sāvakānaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ paññattaṃ, (if we do not preserve the Gospel, {%people will say%}:) {%a perishable set of religious teachings was taught by the monk <ab n="Gotama">G.</ab> to his disciples%}, or in other words, these teachings are perishing, or will perish. In <ls>Vin.</ls> 〔ii.172.15〕, the only other passage recorded, dhūmakālikaṃ pi pariyositaṃ vihāraṃ navakammaṃ denti, {%or they give as new work%} (the reparation of) {%a completed monastery that has proved perishable%}, that has [Page286-b] fallen into ruin, or begun to. The <lex>adj.</lex> dhūmakālika cannot mean, as is supposed, {%lasting to%} (the monkʼs) {%funeral%}, for then it would be synonymous with yāvajīvikaṃ, just before it, in line 15; the time expressions vīsativassikaṃ, tiṃsavassikaṃ, yāvajīvikaṃ, lines 14—15, all forbidden, contrast with lines 26—29 where jobs lasting from 5 or 6 to 10 or 12 years are permitted, but only upon an akataṃ or a vippakataṃ vihāraṃ; it is these latter expressions, in line 25, which contrast with the (forbidden) work on a dhūmakālikaṃ pariyositaṃ vihāraṃ. It seems that this derivative of (<lang>Pali</lang>) dhūmakāla came to be used figuratively in a way fairly remote from its original and literal <ab>mg.</ab>, like English {%to go up in smoke = to be destroyed, completely lost%}.
