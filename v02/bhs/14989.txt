{@śikṣā@}¦ (see also {@śiṣyā@}), ({@1@}) śi° tisraḥ (or, in <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔929〕, trīṇi śikṣāṇi), {%(the three) instructions%} (<lang>Pali</lang> sikkhā), <ab>viz.</ab> by the Vinaya (-piṭaka) in reference to moral conduct (adhiśīlam), by the Sūtra in reference to thought, intellect (adhicittam), by the Abhidharma in reference to wisdom, insight (adhiprajñam); correspondingly in <lang>Pali</lang>: see <ls>Sūtrāl.</ls> 〔xi.1〕; 〔xx.17〕; <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔929〕; <ls>Dharmas</ls> 〔140〕; śikṣāsu <ls>RP</ls> 〔30.11〕. The words adhiśīlam <ab>etc.</ab> were <ab>orig.</ab> adverbs (adhi governing the second member, {%in a manner referring to …%}) and are still so used, <ab>e.g.</ab> <ls>Bbh</ls> 〔373.20—21〕 adhiśīlaṃ (and adhicittaṃ, adhiprajñaṃ) śikṣā; <lex>loc.</lex> forms are also used in the same way, as adhicitte ca āyogaḥ <ls>Ud</ls> 〔xxxii.27(32)〕 = <lang>Pali</lang> <ls>Dhp.</ls> 〔185〕 (same text). These forms may be turned into adjectives: adhiśīlo vihāro <ls>Bbh</ls> 〔335.1〕; sa vihāraḥ adhicitta ity ucyate <ls>Bbh</ls> 〔338.21〕 (this usage seems not recorded in <lang>Pali</lang>). Often the stems adhiśīla-, adhicitta-, adhiprajña- are used as prior members of <ab>cpds.</ab>, in which case precise analysis becomes difficult; so <ls>Bbh</ls> 〔185.14〕; 〔333.2〕; 〔335.3〕; 〔338.24〕; 〔341.8〕; <ab>etc.</ab> But sometimes adhiprajñā-śikṣā is used as a <ab>cpd.</ab>, <ls>Dharmas</ls> 〔140〕, the prior member being then evidently taken as stem of a noun. As nouns, adhiśīla, adhicitta, and adhiprajñā, like their <lang>Pali</lang> equivalents, are used <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔930—2〕; <ls>Bbh</ls> 〔317.2〕 (parallel with adhimuktiḥ), [Page527-b] being then reinterpreted (with adhi = adhika) as {%superior morality, intellect, wisdom%}, see <ls>CPD</ls> <ab>s.vv.</ab> adhisīla, °citta, °paññā; ({@2@}) like <lang>Pali</lang> sikkhā (<ab>tho</ab> <ls>PTSD</ls> and <ls>Childers</ls> do not clearly recognize the fact), śikṣā also means {%morality%}, perhaps as a reflex of its use in the <ab>cpd.</ab> {@śikṣā@} (<lang>Pali</lang> sikkhā)- {@pada@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>: <ls>Bhīk</ls> 〔10a.1〕, after repetition of the five śikṣāpada the novīce says, teṣām … śikṣāyām anuśikṣe, {%I (will) imitate them%} (see {@anuśikṣati@}) {%in moral conduct%}.
