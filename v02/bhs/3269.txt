{@ucchādana@}¦ (= <lang>Pali</lang> <ab>id.</ab>, also <lang>Skt.</lang>, but see below), [Page119-a] in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.269.15〕 and 〔278.1〕, ucchādana-(in 〔278.1〕 <ls>Senart</ls> <ab>em.</ab> āchādana-)-parimardana-svapna- (〔278.1〕 supana-)bhedana-vikiraṇa-vidhvaṃsana-dharma, <ab>ep.</ab> of the body; <ab>corresp.</ab> to <lang>Pali</lang> anicc'ucchādana-parimaddana-bhedanaviddhaṃsana-dhammo, <ab>e.g.</ab> <ls>DN</ls> 〔i.76.18〕, of which I believe the true interpretation was given by <ls>Rhys Davids, Dialogues 1 (1899)</ls>, 〔p. 87 and note〕; ucchādana and parimardana are primarily shampooersʼ terms, {%shampooing and rubbing down%} (so <lang>Skt.</lang>), but with double entente (not recognized in <lang>Pali</lang> <ab>comms.</ab>) also {%destruction and wiping out%}; <ls>BR</ls> suggested that <lang>Skt.</lang> ucchādana was <lang>MIndic</lang> for utsādana, which means both {%rubbing down%} and {%destruction%}; <lang>Skt.</lang> śātayati, {%cuts off, destroys%} (<ab>n. act.</ab> śātana), and root śad-, {%fall%} (<ab>n. act.</ab> śādana, {%<ger>das Ausfallen</ger>%}), may also be concerned, at least in part; see {@śatana@}, used in a <ab>cpd.</ab> very similar to that of <ls>Mv</ls> above; parimardana is noted in <lang>Skt.</lang> and <lang>MIndic</lang> only of shampooing (so also <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔6779〕), but the verb <lang>Skt</lang> parimardati means also {%crushes, destroys%}. In <ls>KP</ls> 〔152.2〕 {@ucchada@} (<ab>q.v.</ab>) must have been limited to its shampooersʼ <ab>mg.</ab>, since snapana follows. But in some <lang>BHS</lang> texts {@śatana@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>, is substituted, eliminating that <ab>mg.</ab> and bringing in exclusively what I (with <ls>Rh.D.</ls>) regard as the secondary, punning <ab>mg.</ab> of the <lang>Pali</lang> <ab>cpd.</ab> <ls>Rhys Davids</ls> renders {%erosion, abrasion%}, admitting that the pun is untranslatable. In American gangstersʼ jargon, {%to rub out%} means {%to obliterate, kill%}. We might render <ls>Mv</ls>: (the body) {%which is characterized by rubbing down (‘off’), wiping away (‘out’), sleep%} (or {%dreams%}, often symbol of impermanence; here, too, a sort of word-play), {%breaking up, scattering, destruction%}.
