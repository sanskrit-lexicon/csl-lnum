[{@añja (añjas?)@}¦, <ab>cf.</ab> <lang>Skt.</lang> añjas, {%quickly%}; exclamation used in <lang>Pali</lang> (<ls>Jāt.</ls> 〔i.192.5, 29〕) in urging a draft-animal to go {%(gee! get up! go ahead!), come up!%} In <ls>LV</ls> 〔394.18〕 (<ab>vs</ab>) tad añja is <ls>Lefm.</ls>ʼs <ab>em.</ab> for tad-anya of all <ab>mss.</ab> and <ed>Calc.</ed> which seems to make no sense. Addressed by Brahmā to the Buddha, urging him to preach the law; presumed to mean perhaps {%come on!%} But <lang>Tib.</lang> seems to have had a quite different reading: <tib>kha ḥbyed pa</tib>, {%mouth open%} (<ls>Foucaux</ls>, {%<fr>ouvre ta bouche</fr>%}; but the form is not given as <lex>impv.</lex> by <ls>Jä.</ls>). Should we read {@ud-añca@}, 2 <ab>sg.</ab> <lex>impv.</lex>, for <lang>Skt.</lang> ud-añcaya, {%<ger>ertönen lassen</ger>%} (<ls>pw</ls>)? Graphic confusion of {%u%} and {%ta%} occurs in some Indian alphabets, <ab>e.g.</ab> in Śāradā.]
