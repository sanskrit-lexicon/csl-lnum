<hom>2</hom> {@uttarya@}¦, <lex>ger.</lex>, in <ls>Kv</ls> 〔32.17〕 vāmanakarūpam abhinirmāya, mṛgājinenottarya, veṇudaṇḍam upagṛhya …, evidently {%covering%} (with a deerskin). <ab>Cf.</ab> <hom>1</hom> {@uttarya@}. As a <lex>ger.</lex> the form seems inexplicable, unless as an extension of the <lang>Skt.</lang> usage with ut-thā-, ut-tambh-; is a <lang>MIndic</lang> uttharya intended (to utstarati, see <ab>s.v.</ab> {@uttharati@}, = stṛṇoti; or to <lang>Skt.</lang> ava plus stṛ-)? Note that <ls>Kv</ls> is also the only text where 1 uttarya is recorded; has the noun influenced the form of the gerund?
