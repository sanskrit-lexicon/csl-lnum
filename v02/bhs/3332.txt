{@utkūla@}¦, <lex>adj.</lex>, {%high, rising%}; only with nikūla, {%low%}, [Page121-b] {%descending%}, and usually in <ab>cpd.</ab> utkūla-nikūla (<ab>cf.</ab> <lang>Pali</lang> ukkūla-vikūla, interpreted as {%high and low%}, <ls>AN comm.</ls> 〔ii.35.21〕), {%high and low%}, hence {%uneven%}: <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔2708〕 °lam, and 〔2709〕 nikūlam (the <lang>Tib.</lang> definitions, <tib>śaṅ ṅam śoṅ</tib> 〔2708〕, <tib>ḥbar ḥbur ram mtho dman</tib> 〔2709〕, seem to refer confusedly to the pair of words together, and mean {%uneven, high-and-low%}); <ls>LV</ls> 〔77.17〕 utkūlanikūlāś ca pṛthivīpradeśāḥ samāḥ samavasthitāḥ, {%and the high-and-low (uneven) places became even%}; 〔272.17〕 utkūla-nikūla-sama-karacaraṇa-gatiḥ (of the Bodhisattvaʼs gait), {%… making even places that were uneven%}; <ls>MSV</ls> 〔i.14.19〕 (as an ādīnava). The <ab>cpd.</ab> utkūla-nikūla occurs <ls>VS</ls> 〔30.14〕, where it is unexplained in <ab>comm.</ab> and not definable by context; utkūla occurs once or twice besides; nikūla is hardly recorded otherwise, and seems to be unknown in <lang>MIndic</lang> (<lang>Pali</lang> has vikūla instead, above).
