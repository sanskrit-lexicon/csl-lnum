{@purima-kāraka@}¦, <lex>m.</lex>, °kā(ḥ) <ab>n. pl.</ab>, some sort of artisan or tradesman, in a list of occupations: <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.113.14〕; 〔443.1〕 (so without <ab>v.l.</ab> both times, except one <ab>ms.</ab> in 〔443.1〕 °kārā). What {%makers of purima%} means is not clear, but this word can hardly be identified with the <lex>adj.</lex> {@purima@}. [Page348-b] It is <ab>prob.</ab> connected with <lang>AMg.</lang> purima as cited by <ls>Sheth</ls> (as a <lang>Deśī</lang> word) from Ohaṇijjutti 〔265〕 (I have not found it in <ls>Ratnach.</ls>) cha ppurimā nava khoḍā; the word khoḍa = {%cleansing%} a part of a garment (see <ls>Ratnach.</ls> <ab>s.v.</ab>), and <ls>Sheth</ls> says purima, like khoḍa, is a part of the Jain cleansing ceremony, (prasphoṭana or) pratilekhana. If {%cleaning%} is the <ab>mg.</ab>, our <ab>cpd.</ab> would perhaps mean {%professional cleaners%} (of clothes). I have no access to the Ohaṇijjutti.
