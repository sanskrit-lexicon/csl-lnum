{@Utkarika@}¦, <ab>n.</ab> of a merchant: <ls>Divy</ls> 〔227.26〕 tatrānyataraś cotkariko nāma baṇig … <ab>Cf.</ab> {@Otkarika@} (the same person as Utk°). There seems to be no reason to connect this <ab>n. pr.</ab> with aukarika (okkarika), <ab>qq.v.</ab>, as has been assumed by <ls>Feer</ls>, <ls>Speyer</ls> (on <ls>Av, Index</ls>, <ab>s.v.</ab> okkarika) and <ls>Cowell and Neil (Index to Divy)</ls>. But perhaps we should read cautk° in 〔227.26〕 and assume Otk° as the name.
