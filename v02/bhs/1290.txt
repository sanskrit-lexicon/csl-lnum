{@aparāntaka@}¦, <lex>f.</lex> {@°ikā@}, <lex>adj.</lex> {%of the western border, or of the country called Aparānta%}; used of cloth or garments, also as <lex>nt.</lex> noun, (cloth or garments) {%of Aparānta%} <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔9179〕; °ka- in <ab>cpd.</ab> <ls>Divy</ls> 〔316.26〕, of garments (<lex>adj.</lex> or noun?). In <ls>Divy</ls> 〔20.22—23〕 perhaps read aparāntikayā guptikayā {%in the style of Aparānta%} (? see {@guptikā@}); text asmāt parānti°. In <ls>Divy</ls> 〔1.3〕; 〔18.6〕; 〔19.16, 19, 23〕; 〔21.2, 12〕 the <ab>mss.</ab> read corruptly, and with much variation, a text discussed by the editors on 〔p. 703〕; they read asmāt parāntaka- and interpret as a synonym of {@pratyantima@}, except in 〔19.19〕 where they read asmākam aparāntaka-, interpreting (with privative a-) as the opposite, {%not distant, near%}. The forms are troublesome; without much confidence I suggest that forms of aparāntaka may have been found in all, meaning something like {%of the western border%} (if not specifically {%of the country Aparānta%}). But <lang>Tib.</lang> (<ls>Bailey, JRAS</ls> 〔1950.172〕) on 〔19.19〕 points to {@Aśmāparāntaka@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>; and this seems to have been the regular <lang>Tib.</lang> form <ab>acc.</ab> to <ls>Schiefner</ls>, cited <ls>Divy</ls> 〔p. 703〕.
