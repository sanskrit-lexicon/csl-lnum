{@kalpam@}¦, <lex>adv.</lex> (from {@kalpa@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>; = <lang>Pali</lang> kappaṃ), <ab>lit.</ab> and <ab>orig.</ab> {%for a kalpa, = for a long time%}: <ls>SP</ls> 〔227.5〕 (prose) (yaḥ … tathāgatasya) saṃmukhaṃ kalpam avarṇaṃ bhāṣet, {%who should for a long time speak ill before%} (= towards) {%a <ab n="Tathāgata">T.</ab>%} (The translators misunderstand.) The verse account has (〔229.7〕) yaś caiva … jinasya saṃmukhaṃ śrāved avarṇaṃ paripūrṇakalpam, {%… for a full kalpa%}, which may therefore be the <ab>mg.</ab> of 〔227.5〕; but the <lang>Pali</lang> <lex>adv.</lex> is well established.
