{@atyudgacchati@}¦, and <lex>ppp.</lex> {@atyudgata@}, sometimes in texts and oftener in <ab>mss.</ab> (frequently as <ab>v.l.</ab>) for {@abhyud°@} in meaning {%rises%} (<lex>ppp.</lex> {%risen%}) {%above%}. Graphic confusion is certainly concerned here, at least in part; except as under {@atyudgata@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>, all occurrences are grouped under {@abhyud°@}, <ab>q.v.</ab> For the most part <lang>Pali</lang> abbhuggacchati and derivatives support this classification. Note however (aside from <lang>Pali</lang> accuggata, apparently only used as adjective, often with specialized meanings) <lang>Pali</lang> accuggamma, <lex>ger.</lex>, used of water-plants, {%having grown out above%} (the water, <lex>acc.</lex> or <lex>abl.</lex>); but <lang>BHS</lang> uses (only) abhyudgacchati in this sense, according to unanimous tradition, <ab>tho</ab> perhaps this tradition may be erroneous. Contrariwise, there is even in <lang>Pali</lang> tradition some confusion between abbhugg- and accugg- in this group; see <ls>CPD</ls> <ab>s.v.</ab> abbhuggata (a <ab>var.</ab> accuggata occurs with subject yaso).
