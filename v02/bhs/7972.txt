{@dhyāna@}¦, <lex>nt.</lex> (<lang>Skt.</lang> <ab>id.</ab>; in technical sense = <lang>Pali</lang> jhāna), <ab>lit.</ab> {%meditation%} or {%contemplation; mystic ‘trance’%}; <ls>Lévi (Sūtrāl.)</ls> {%<fr>extase</fr>%}. Normally {%four%}, as in <lang>Pali</lang>, described in some detail in a long ancient passage (the <lang>Pali</lang> form, virtually identical, cited in <ls>Childers</ls>), found with hardly a true variant <ls>LV</ls> 〔129.1—11〕; 〔343.14—344.4〕; <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.228.3—10〕; 〔ii.131.16—132.5〕; <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔1478—1481〕; an abbreviated form, giving the central points, as follows: savitarkaṃ savicāraṃ vivekajaṃ prītisukham iti prathamadhyānaṃ, adhyātmapramodanāt [Page287-b] prītisukham iti dvitīyaṃ, upekṣāsmṛtisaṃprajanyaṃ sukham iti tṛtīyaṃ, upekṣāsmṛtipariśuddhir aduḥkhāsukhā vedaneti caturthaṃ dhyānam iti <ls>Dharmas</ls> 〔72〕; they are the first four of the nine {@anupūrvavihāra(-samāpatti)@}, <ab>qq.v.</ab>; these are related to the four dhyānabhūmi constituted or occupied by the various classes of {@rūpāvacara@} gods (see {@deva@}), as explained by <ls>Childers</ls>, in that attainment in worldly life of (various stages of adeptness in) each of the four dhyāna leads to rebirth in successively higher stages among these gods; catu-dhyāna- (meter proves single initial consonant pronounced for written dhy-)-dhyāyino (as before) <ls>SP</ls> 〔131.5〕 (<ab>vs</ab>); {%three%} dhyāna, listed as sadoṣāpakarṣa-, sukhavaihārika-, and aśeṣavaibhūṣita- (read {@°vaibhūtika-?@} see this word), <ls>Dharmas</ls> 〔109〕; I have found no other trace of this list; the names sound vaguely as if the first might apply to the first of the 4 dhyāna, the second to the 2d and 3d combined, and the third to the 4th; in <ls>Laṅk</ls> 〔10.11〕 na ṣaḍdhyānādidhyāyinā (tvayā bhavitavyam), {%you should not meditate on such things as the six dhyāna%}; apparently some reprehended practices are meant, but I have no more idea of the specific meaning than had <ls>Suzuki</ls> (<ls>Studies</ls>, 〔414〕).
