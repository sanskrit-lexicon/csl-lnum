? {@abhauti-@}¦, in <ls>Laṅk</ls> 〔17.5〕, text abhauti-bhautikānām; <ls>Suzuki</ls> {%things created and uncreated%}; the <ab>mss.</ab> are very confused; some simply abhautikānāṃ; perhaps read [Page060-b] abhautika-bhaut° (and perhaps render rather {%of things non-elemental and elemental%}). Surely no stem abhauti should be recognized. See {@bhautika@} (2); one possible reading for the above passage might be bhūta-bhautikānām, {%of gross elements and%} (subsidiary elements or) {%sense-objects%}.
