{@*samuttara@}¦, {%a crossing over%} (<ab>cf.</ab> next), in an-a-samuttaro <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.14.10〕 (<ab>vs</ab>), {%having no crossing over, that cannot be crossed over%}, see under {@an-a-@}. <ls>Senart</ls> assumes that °tara is for {@°tāra@} (next), presumably <ab>m.c.</ab>; meter does indeed require a short <ab>penult</ab>. But neither °tara nor °tāra seems to be recorded except here and in the <ls>Divy</ls> passages, which are substantially repetitions of a single passage.
