({@ca@}¦, as in normal <lang>Skt.</lang> (<ls>BR</ls>; <ls>Speyer, Skt. Synt.</ls> 〔§ 441b〕, <ls>VSS</ls> 〔§ 282〕), is used ({@1@}) in sentences where a contrast seems implied, = tu, {%but%}: te caivaṃ vācaṃ bhāṣeran, tac ca bhaiṣajyam upanāmitaṃ na pibeyuḥ <ls>SP</ls> 〔321.10—11〕, {%on the one hand%} (ca) {%they would speak thus, and yet%} (ca; {%on the other hand%}) {%they would not drink the proffered remedy%}; ({@2@}) in the protasis of conditions, = yadi (<ab>acc.</ab> to <ls>Speyer, VSS</ls> [Page220-1b] <ab>l. c.</ab>, ‘in <lang>Vedic</lang> and <lang>older Skt.</lang>,’ but this is too limited): deśayeyaṃ cāhaṃ dharmaṃ na vā deśayeyam <ls>LV</ls> 〔400.7〕, {%whether I preach the dharma or not%}—(the same result, as regards some people, will ensue); śakraś ca (<ab>mss.</ab>, <ls>Senart</ls> <ab>em.</ab> ce) me varaṃ dadyāt <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.6.15〕, {%if Śakra should give me a boon%}—. ({@3@}) <ab>Acc.</ab> to <ls>Senart</ls>, <ls>MV</ls> 〔i notes pp. 370, 501, 561〕, ca may introduce a following word, [Page221-a] as ‘proclitic’, no longer enclitic; he says the same is authorized for <lang>Pali</lang> by the Mukhamattadīpanī, a <ab>comm.</ab> on Kaccāyana. Alleged cases are cited in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.3.11〕; 〔57.10〕; 〔83.17〕 (? read 16?); 〔158.1〕; 〔241.13〕. In some of these (<ab>e.g.</ab> 〔158.1〕) ca seems to me quite normal; in others the position may be peculiar, as sometimes it is in <lang>Pali</lang>, see <ls>Childers</ls> <ab>s.v.</ab>, but I do not believe it ever introduces a following word or phrase; some of the passages cited are violently emended by <ls>Senart</ls> in other respects. The <ls>Pali Dictt.</ls> do not recognize the usage alleged by <ls>Senart</ls>, and I am not convinced that it occurs in <lang>BHS</lang>.)
