? {@svayaṃ@}¦, interpreted by <ls>Senart</ls> twice as prior member of <ab>cpds.</ab> in <ab>mg.</ab> {%own%}, = <lang>Skt.</lang> sva(ka), <lex>adj.</lex>, for which saya, <lex>adj.</lex>, is common in <lang>AMg.</lang>; I could hardly accept <ls>Senart</ls>ʼs interpretation except on the assumption that the word is a form of that <lang>MIndic</lang> <lex>adj.</lex>; <ab>cf.</ab> conversely {@svakam@}, <ab>acc.</ab> to <ls>Senart</ls> = svayam. I can however not regard the interpretation as certain. In <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.284.4〕 (prose), kumāro brahmacārī svayam (<ab>perh.</ab> svaya-with m Hiatus-bridger?)āśrame (<ab>mss.</ab> °maṃ) paryaṅkena niṣaṇṇo, svayam could be taken in its ordinary <lang>Skt.</lang> sense, {%(the youth) himself%}, rather than {%in his own hermitage%} with <ls>Senart</ls>. In 〔i.302.6〕 (prose), <ls>Senart</ls> by <ab>em.</ab> svayaṃdhītā saṃveditā, {%he spoke to his own daughter%}; if it means this, I should read svayā, or (<lang>Skt.</lang>) svakā, or possibly svaya- (in <ab>comp.</ab>), dhītā; the [Page616-a] <ab>mss.</ab> read svajanaṃ dhītā saṃviditā; could this (taking svajanaṃ as <lex>nom.</lex>) mean {%his people%} (and specifically) {%his daughter was admonished?%} Undoubtedly his daughter alone is actually addressed in the following, evaṃ tuvaṃ …; and <ab>cf.</ab> svakā dhītā 〔304.8〕, in the verse version of the story; on the whole the <ab>mg.</ab> assumed by <ls>Senart</ls> is <ab>prob.</ab> to be accepted, but I question the form (= <lang>Skt.</lang> svayam).
