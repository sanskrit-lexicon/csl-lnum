<hom>1</hom> {@śreṇika@}¦, <lex>adj.</lex> (<ab>cf.</ab> {@a-śreṇika@}), a (relatively) complimentary epithet of a wandering mendicant, always with parivrājakaḥ: <ls>ŚsP</ls> 〔615.12〕; 〔633.13〕; <ls>AsP</ls> 〔8.21〕; 〔9.10〕. But apparently not a Buddhist; his knowledge is ‘limited’, {@prādeśika@}, <ls>ŚsP</ls> 〔615.13〕, <ab>tho</ab> superior to that of the aśreṇika. <ab>Cf.</ab> <ls>Rahder, JAOS</ls> 〔70.126〕. One might guess that śreṇika meant ‘members of a guild or (non-Buddhist) order of monks’; but śreṇi is not a normal expression for a religious order. In <lang>AMg.</lang> seḍhi (= <lang>Skt.</lang> śreṇi) is used of a certain stage of religious advancement among the Jains, and a-seḍhi-gaya (= <lang>Skt.</lang> *a-śreṇi-gata) means one who has not yet attained that stage; see <ls>Ratnach.</ls> <ab>s.vv.</ab> Could aśreṇika equal <lang>AMg.</lang> aseḍhigaya, and śreṇika, its opposite, one who has attained that stage ? Two Jain terms used, and applied to Jain or other heterodox monks? This is only a guess, and <ab>prob.</ab> not likely.
