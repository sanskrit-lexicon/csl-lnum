{@adhimucyate, °ti@}¦ (= <lang>Pali</lang> adhimuccati; <ab>cf.</ab> <ab>prec.</ab> and <ab>foll.</ab> iteṃs), ({@1@}) {%is actively interested in, zealous for, earnestly devoted to, intent upon%} (with <lex>acc.</lex>); see under {@adhimukti@} for <lang>Tib.</lang> rendering, and discussion of meanings, which on the whole parallel those of the verb; see also {@adhimukta, adhimokṣa@}, and other derivatives. The object is generally religious, and most commonly religious knowledge or sacred texts (see especially {@adhimukta@} for non-religious applications): eṣāṃ … nirvāṇaṃ bhāṣate yad adhimucyante, <ls>SP</ls> 〔187.2—3〕, {%preaches to them nirvāṇa%} (the Hīnayāna goal), {%to which they zealously apply themselves%}; adhimucyante <ls>SP</ls> 〔288.3〕 (upāyakauśalyaṃ saṃdhābhāṣitaṃ); (jñāna[m]) 〔302.7〕; <ls>KP</ls> 〔140.9〕; °yanti <ls>SP</ls> 〔232.9〕 (dharmaparyāyaṃ); <ls>KP</ls> 〔139.6〕; adhimucyami <ls>Bhad</ls> 〔3, 7〕 (pūja sarvajinānāṃ); adhimucye (1 <ab>sg.</ab>) <ls>Bhad</ls> 〔6³〕; adhimucyed (<lex>opt.</lex>) <ls>SP</ls> 〔255.2〕 (idaṃ sūtraṃ); 〔336.4〕; adhimokṣyate (<lex>fut.</lex>) <ls>SP</ls> 〔260.8〕 (saddharmapuṇḍarīkaṃ); °kṣyanti <ls>LV</ls> 〔89.8〕 (sūtrāntān); adhimucyamāna (<lex>pres. pple.</lex>) <ls>RP</ls> 〔4.15〕; anadhimucyamāna (preceded by hiatus-bridging m-) <ls>KP</ls> 〔139.3, 5〕, {%not showing inclination towards%} (instruction); sa maitrīsahagatena cittena … ekāṃ diśam adhimucya (<lang>Tib.</lang> <tib>mos te</tib>; {%zealously concentrating on one-direction%}) sphāritvopasaṃpadya viharati <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔1508〕 (and so on, until finally he does the same with sarvāvantam imaṃ lokam, 〔1509〕); adhimoktum (<lex>inf.</lex>) <ls>Gv</ls> 〔5.10〕 (tathāgatajñānaṃ); adhimucyitum <ls>KP</ls> 〔39.9〕; ({@2@}) rarely, used in the sense defined by <ls>CPD</ls> under adhimuccati (d) as {%to make a (magical) act of volition%}; but a better definition would be {%changes%} (something, <lex>acc.</lex>) {%by magic into%} (something else, <lex>acc.</lex>), as in <ls>Vin.</ls> 〔iii.250.25—26〕 pāsādaṃ suvaṇṇaṃ ti adhimucci, so ahosi sabbasovaṇṇamayo (<ab>comm.</ab> sovaṇṇamayo hotū ti adhiṭṭhāsi). Doubtless the original or literal meaning was, {%he concentrated his interest on the palace, with the thought%}—(it is to be) {%gold!- and it became entirely made of gold%}. In <lang>BHS</lang> the word (i)ti is omitted: <ls>Bbh</ls> 〔60.5〕 pṛthivīm apo 'dhimucyate, {%changes%} (magically) {%earth into water%}, and a series of like clauses in the sequel. So in the miracle of turning four bowls into [Page015-a] one: catvāri śailamayāni pātrāṇi grahāyaikaṃ pātram adhimuktam <ls>Divy</ls> 〔393.17—18〕, (by the Buddha) {%taking the four stone bowls, a single bowl was made by magic%}; <ab>cf.</ab> pratigṛhya caikaṃ pātram adhitiṣṭhati sma, adhimuktibalena <ls>LV</ls> 〔385.4—5〕, {%and having accepted%} (the four bowls) {%he changed%} (them) {%magically%} (see <ab>s.v.</ab> {@adhitiṣṭhati@}) {%into a single bowl, by his power of magic transformation%}.
