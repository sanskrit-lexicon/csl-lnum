{@satkāya@}¦, <lex>m.</lex> (= <lang>Pali</lang> sakkāya), {%real, existent, body; individuality, personality%}: mā … imaṃ … satkāyaṃ kāyaṃ manyadhvam <ls>AsP</ls> 〔94.12〕, {%donʼt think this existent (physical) body%} (of Tathāgatas) {%is their body%} (but rather regard the {@dharmakāya@} as such); virtually = ātman, once at least in neutral or even favorable sense, prītibhakṣā bhaviṣyāmo satkāyenopaniḥśritāḥ (read °niśritāḥ) <ls>Ud</ls> 〔xxx.50〕, {%we shall feed on joy, relying on our selves%} (alone, not dependent on anything outside); but commonly in unfavorable sense, of the personality to believe in which is a heresy ({@dṛṣṭi@}, see next); satkāyasaṃjñīkṛtaṃ (<ab>sc.</ab> śarīraṃ) <ls>LV</ls> 〔208.13〕 (<ab>vs</ab>), {%formed <ab>thru</ab> the false notion of the personality%}; nārāyaṇabhūtaṃ satkāya-dharma-nistāḍana-tayā <ls>Gv</ls> 〔495.6〕, {%… because it puts down the qualities of the individuality%}. There seems little doubt of the <ab>etym.</ab> and fundamental meaning of this word (probably no one now agrees with <ls>Childers</ls> that it was <ab>orig.</ab> sva-kāya); and the scholastic fantasies of various schools listed by <ls>LaV-P.</ls> in <ls>AbhidhK.</ls> 〔v.15—17〕 need not be recorded here, <ab>tho</ab> they evidently influenced <lang>Tib.</lang> and <lang>Chin.</lang> interpretations.
