{@Amarā@}¦, ({@1@}) <ab>n.</ab> of a smithʼs daughter (= later Yaśodharā), who married Mahauṣadha; heroine of a Jātaka which = the <lang>Pali</lang> <ls>Sūci-j.</ls>, 〔No. 387〕: <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.83.19 ff.〕; colophon 〔89.11〕 Amarāye karmāradhītāye jātakam. In the <ls>Sūci-j.</ls> the characters are unnamed; but (<lang>Pali</lang>) Mahosadha [Page063-a] is the hero of the <ls>Mahāummagga-j.</ls>, 〔No. 546〕, and Amarā is his wife. This has misled both <ls>CPD</ls> and <ls>DPPN</ls> into identifying {%this%} <lang>Pali</lang> Jātaka with the story of <ls>Mv</ls>. Actually the stories are quite different, and <ls>Mv</ls> agrees with the <ls>Sūci-j.</ls>, which, to be sure, <ab>acc.</ab> to the Story of the Present, belongs to the same occasion as the Mahāummagga; hence doubtless the transfer of the names of the hero and heroine from one to the other. Which was the original? ({@2@}) <ab>n.</ab> of a river: <ls>Māy</ls> 〔253.6〕; in a list between Viśvāmitrā and Tāmarā; not in <ls>Kirfel</ls>; perhaps read Amalā? (but this also is not recorded as a river-name).
