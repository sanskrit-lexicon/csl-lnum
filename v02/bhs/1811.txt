{@Amitābha@}¦, ({@1@}) <ab>n.</ab> of the Buddha who presides over the western paradise {@Sukhāvatī@} (lokadhātu); also known as {@Amitāyu(s), Amitaprabha, Amitanātha@}, and doubtless intended by the <ls>Mmk</ls> names {@Amitāyu(rjñāna)viniścayarājendra@} (or the like), even <ab>tho</ab> he is once depicted separately in a painting centering about that personage (<ls>Mmk</ls> 〔305.12—13〕, <ab>cf.</ab> 〔304.25〕). See these names separately. The two commonest names are Amitābha and Amitāyus, and they are as a rule quite equivalent and interchangeable; see notably <ls>Sukh</ls> 〔62.13—14〕; 〔95.15〕 and 20. Often Sukhāvatī is mentioned with him. He is the fourth of the ‘transcendent’ Buddhas, <ls>Dharmas</ls> 〔3〕; <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔85〕. Other occurrences: <ls>Suv</ls> 〔2.5〕; <ls>Bhad</ls> 〔49, 57, 59, 62〕; <ls>Śikṣ</ls> 〔175.6〕; <ls>Kv</ls> 〔18.7〕; 〔21.8〕 <ab>etc.</ab>; <ls>Mmk</ls> 〔42.16〕; 〔426.7〕; <ls>Gv</ls> 〔82.5〕; <ls>Laṅk</ls> 〔283.7〕; <ls>Sukh</ls> 〔1.6〕; 〔28.10〕 <ab>etc.</ab>; <ls>Sādh</ls> 〔16.10〕 <ab>etc.</ab>; ({@2@}) <ab>n.</ab> of a Bodhisattva: <ls>Gv</ls> 〔442.22〕 (one of a long list, and hardly to be identified with the Buddha <ab n="Amitābha">A.</ab>).
