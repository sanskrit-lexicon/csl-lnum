{@cakṣus@}¦, in pañca-c° (= <lang>Pali</lang> pañca-cakkhu), {%the five superior qualities of vision%} (partly physical, partly mental or spiritual) possessed by a Buddha (<ab>cf.</ab> pañcacakṣuḥsamanvāgata <ls>LV</ls> 〔3.5〕; 〔403.2〕, of Buddha): listed, in agreement except for order, <ls>Dharmas</ls> 〔66〕; <ls>Sūtrāl.</ls> 〔xviii.54〕, <ab>comm.</ab>; and <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.158.1 ff.〕, where each is explained in some detail, <ab>viz.</ab> māṃsa-c° 〔158.8—159.5〕; divya-c° 〔159.5—7〕; prajñā-c° 〔159.8—9〕; dharma-c° 〔159.9—160.7〕 (= daśānāṃ balānāṃ manovibhutā, 〔159.10〕; then follows a statement on the 10 bala, 〔159.12—160.5〕, in verse); and buddha-c° 〔160.7—16〕 (this = the 18 āveṇikā buddhadharmāḥ, which are then listed). In <lang>Pali</lang> (see <ls>Childers</ls> and <ls>PTSD</ls>) the list contains maṃsa-, dibba-, paññā-, and buddha-cakkhu, but for dharma- substitutes samanta-c° (before or after buddha-c°). A difficult and corrupt line, <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.42.15〕 = 〔53.12〕 = 〔337.4〕 (in the last printed by <ls>Senart</ls> as prose), contains some form of bhava-cakṣuka, which <ls>Senart</ls> regards as containing a *bhava-cakṣu(s) = māṃsa-c°, quite wrongly; his <ab>transl.</ab> (note on 〔42.15〕) misunderstands māṃsa-c° which is a complimentary and superior power, not one to be derogated. Possibly rather {%eye of existence%} and agreeing with prajñā-skandha (〔337.4〕 prajñā-cakṣu[r])? The preponderant evidence of the <ab>mss.</ab> points to bhavacakṣuke (or °ko or °kaiḥ) apāye prajñāskandho (or °dhe, °dhā; 〔337.4〕 see above) niveśeyaṃ (? °yaḥ, or other <ab>vv.ll.</ab>). All too obscure to be useful.
