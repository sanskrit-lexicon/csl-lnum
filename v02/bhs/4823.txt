{@Kāśyapa@}¦ (= <lang>Pali</lang> Kassapa; <lang>Tib.</lang> <tib>ḥod sruṅs</tib>, {%light-guard%}, <ab>e.g.</ab> on <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔93〕), ({@1@}) <ab>n.</ab> of a former Buddha, the one immediately preceding Śākyamuni: often mentioned as having predicted the latter, and <ab>esp.</ab> as one of a group of three, the others being {@Krakucchanda@} and {@Kanakamuni@}, or equivalents; see the former for list of such references; also alone (it being not always certain that this particular Buddha is meant, <ab>cf.</ab> <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.58.8〕, <ab>ref.</ab> to 90,000 Buddhas of this name), <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.307.4 ff.〕; 〔312.2〕; 〔318.7 ff.〕; [Page182-a] 〔iii.249.8〕; <ls>Divy</ls> 〔22.4 ff.〕; 〔54.12, 25〕; 〔76.26 ff.〕; 〔192.25 ff.〕; 〔233.21 ff.〕; 〔336.21〕; 〔337.17〕; 〔344.4 ff.〕; 〔347.1 ff.〕; 〔465.25 ff.〕; 〔504.26〕; <ls>Av</ls> 〔i.237.11〕; 〔247.15〕, <lat><ab>et alibi</ab></lat>; <ls>Karmav</ls> 〔159.7〕; <ls>LV</ls> 〔172.9〕; 〔260.10〕; <ls>Mmk</ls> 〔104.17 ff.〕; ({@2@}) <ab>n.</ab> of one of Buddhaʼs leading disciples, also called {@Mahā-k°@} (= <lang>Pali</lang> Kassapa or Mahā-k°), <ab>q.v.</ab>; there is no doubt that the same person is, as a rule at least, meant by the two forms, notably Kā° in <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔1031〕; <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.48.2〕; <ls>SP</ls> 〔116.4〕; 〔121.3 ff.〕; 〔144.2 ff.〕; 〔206.8 ff.〕; <ls>Divy</ls> 〔83.10 ff.〕; 〔396.1〕; <ab n="Kāśyapa">K.</ab> is given the title dhutaguṇāgrapāraga <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.64.14 (ff.)〕, where he is involved as an interlocutor at the First Council, perhaps its presiding officer (as in <lang>Pali</lang>, <ls>DPPN</ls>); he then and there causes Kātyāyana to discourse on the 10 bhūmi; similarly <ls>Divy</ls> 〔61.28〕 calls him dhūtaguṇa-vādinām agro, and <ab>cf.</ab> <lang>Pali</lang> <ls>AN</ls> 〔i.23.19〕 where Mahākassapa is dhutavādānaṃ (<ab>v.l.</ab> dhūtaṅgadharānaṃ) agga; mentioned in Candropama Sūtra, <ls>Hoernle MR</ls> 〔40 ff.〕, = <lang>Pali</lang> <ls>SN</ls> 〔ii.197 ff.〕 where (Mahā) Kassapa corresponds; among mahāśrāvakas, <ls>Divy</ls> 〔182.22〕; 〔268.6〕; in <ls>Divy</ls> 〔573.8〕 it appears, strangely, that āryakāśyapasya is an epithet of (the next word) Kātyāyanasya (pañcaśataparivārasya; in the story which follows only Mahākātyāyana appears!); it is not clear whether the same person is meant by āyuṣmān daśabalaḥ Kāśyapaḥ <ls>Divy</ls> 〔275.5〕, and 7 daśabala-Kāś°;* no monk of this title is recorded in <lang>Pali</lang>; in <ls>Vv. comm.</ls> 〔148.24〕 Kassapassa dasabalassa kāle refers to the Buddha Kāś°, <ab>tho</ab> I find no evidence to support <ls>PTSD</ls> and <ls>DPPN</ls> in stating that dasabala was ‘especially’ an epithet of his, ‘to distinguish him from other Kassapas’ as <ls>DPPN</ls> says; dasabala (<lang>BHS</lang> daśa°) of course usually refers to a Buddha, and in <lang>Pali</lang> generally to the <ab>B.</ab> Gotama; there are at least four other disciples of his having this name, see {@Uruvilvā-k°, Kumāra-k°, Gayā-k°, Nadī-k°@}; ({@3@}) <ab>n.</ab> of an ascetic (ṛṣi) who once lived in the Himālaya: <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.106.16〕, a previous birth of {@Mahākāśyapa@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>, 〔114.12〕; ({@4@}) <ab>n.</ab> of another (?) ascetic (ṛṣi) who lived in the hermitage {@sāhaṃjanī@} (<ab>q.v.</ab>; this is not mentioned in connection with the <ab>prec.</ab> Kā°, and the stories told of them are different): <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.143.13 ff.〕 (in story of Ekaśṛṅga and Nalinī; = <lang>Pali</lang> Kassapa 9 in <ls>DPPN</ls>); <ab>prob.</ab> the same (at least also living in Sāhaṃjanī) <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.362.14〕; 〔363.19〕. See also {@Pūraṇa Kāśyapa; Jaṅghā-k°@}; {@Vṛddha-k°@}. —*Correction in proof: <ls>MPS</ls> 〔49.16〕 names four mahāsthavirāḥ in the world (pṛthivyāṃ) at the time of Buddhaʼs death; two of them were Daśabala-Kāśyapa (one word) and Mahā-Kāśyapa. This settles the above question; <ab n="Daśabala-Kāśyapa">D.K.</ab> is a separate person.
