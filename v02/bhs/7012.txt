{@tulya@}¦, <lex>adj.</lex>, used in a peculiar sense in <ls>SP</ls>, and as I think misunderstood by <ls>Burnouf</ls> and <ls>Kern</ls>: {%equal%} in the sense of {%equally available, open to choice%} (said of different forms of dharma, {%religion%}, and specifically thinking of the three yānas): tulye (so with <ls>Kashgar rec.</ls>, text tulya-)nāma dharmadhātupraveśe <ls>SP</ls> 〔60.8〕 (prose), {%when entrance into the sphere of religion is, after all%} (nāma), {%alike%} (all the same, open to free choice); the sequel complains that the speaker has been given only the hīna yāna by the Buddha; tulyeṣu dharmeṣu <ls>SP</ls> 〔61.12〕; 〔62.2〕 (both <ab>vss</ab>). Chinese versions confirm this interpretation.
