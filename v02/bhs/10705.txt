{@-prāpta@}¦, <lex>ppp.</lex> (= <lang>Skt.</lang> <ab>id.</ab>, <lang>Pali</lang> -patta), in āścarya-, adbhuta-pr° generally means {%filled with astonishment and wonder%} (<ab>e.g.</ab> <ls>SP</ls> 〔188.5〕). But in <ls>SP</ls> 〔183.4—5〕 āścaryaprāptā … adbhutaprāptā ime ṣoḍaśa śrāmaṇerāḥ, rather, something like {%arrived at a wonderful thing or condition, marvelously successful%}. In <ls>KP</ls> 〔9.5〕 and 〔10.5〕 dāntājāneya-prāpta (bodhisattva), and <ls>KP</ls> 〔9.14〕; 〔10.17, 20〕 ājanya-prāpta (bodhisattva), clearly {%arrived at (the condition of being …)%} <ab>i.e.</ab> {%become (tamed) noble%} ({%steeds%}, see {@ājanya, ājāneya@}). In most of these, <lang>Tib.</lang> renders prāpta by <tib>thob pa</tib>, which <ab>acc.</ab> to <ls>Jä.</ls> primarily means {%get, attain%}, but in expressions like <tib>saṅs rgyas thob pa</tib> {%become%} (<ab>lit.</ab> {%get%}) {%a Buddha%}. This latter seems clearly parallel to the use of -prāpta in these <ls>KP</ls> passages. Ordinarily a <ab>cpd.</ab> ending in -prāpta has as its prior member an abstract noun. Note however that some such prior members may be either abstract or concrete; thus adbhuta may mean either {%surprising%} or {%surprise%}. Possibly the <ls>KP</ls> usage arose by analogy of such compounds. There are other <ab>cpds.</ab> of prāpta with a preceding <lex>adj.</lex>; see <ab>s.v.</ab> {@niṣkāṅkṣa@}.
