{@a-kisara-lābhin@}¦, <lex>adj.</lex>, and {@°bhi-tā@}, <ab>abstr.</ab>; also in <lang>Skt.</lang> form as {@a-kṛcchra°@}, {%(state of) obtaining without difficulty%}: akṛcchra-lābhī (<ab>n. sg.</ab>) <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔2432〕 = <tib>dkaḥ pa med par thob pa</tib>, and akisara-l° 〔2433〕 = <tib>tshegs med par°</tib>, or, <tib>ṅan ṅon ma yin par°</tib>; akṛcchrākisaralābhi-tā <ls>Bbh</ls> 〔388.13〕 = (<ab>acc.</ab> to note) <lang>Tib.</lang> <tib>ṅan ṅon ma yin par thob pa daṅ tshegs med par thob pa</tib>. The three <lang>Tib.</lang> translations are synonymous; it is striking that both the <lang>MIndic</lang> and the <ab>Sktized</ab> forms are recorded together in both <ls>Mvy</ls> and <ls>Bbh</ls>. <lang>Pali</lang> has both akasiralābhi(n) and akiccha°; otherwise the <ab>cpd.</ab> is not recorded. Even akṛcchra is not recorded in <lang>Skt.</lang> except for akṛcchra-laṅghya in <ls>pw</ls> 〔5.240〕 (from <ls>Rājat.</ls>; perhaps due to Buddhist influence?). See {@kisara@}; it appears that in <lang>Pali</lang>, too, kasira and kiccha, both historically from kṛcchra, came to be understood as different words. This suggests that <lang>BHS</lang> a-kṛcchra-lābhin may be a <ab>Sktization</ab> of an older <lang>MIndic</lang> a-kiccha° (= <lang>Pali</lang> and <lang>Pkt.</lang> <ab>id.</ab>), specifically, and not of <lang>BHS</lang> {@kisara@}, which maintained an independent existence for a time, <ab>tho</ab> ultimately it was crowded out by the <ab>Sktized</ab> kṛcchra.
