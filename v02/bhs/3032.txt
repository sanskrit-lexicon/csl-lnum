{@āvyūhati@}¦ = {@āyūhati@}, {%exerts oneself towards, carries out, performs%}, with <lex>acc.</lex>: <ls>MadhK</ls> 〔298.13〕; 〔517.20〕 sa na kaṃcid dharmam āvyūhati nirvyūhati tasyaivam anāvyūhato 'nirvyūhatas traidhātuke cittaṃ na sajjati. Is nirvyūhati a near-synonym of āvyūhati, as niryūhati certainly is of āyūhati in <ls>Gv</ls>? Or is it (as assumed by <lang>Tib.</lang> and <ls>LaVallée-Poussin</ls>) an antonym of āvyūhati, as {@niryūhati@} is of {@āyūhati@} in <ls>Laṅk</ls>, and as (a)niryūha is of (an)āyūha? See <ab>s.vv</ab> {@anāyūha, anāvyūha, anirvyūha@}.
