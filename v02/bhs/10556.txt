{@pravyāhṛtavatī@}¦, <ls>Av</ls> 〔ii.10.9〕, following uvāca (<lex>fem.</lex> subject), can, it seems, only be a periphrastic form substituting for the perfect, from <lang>Skt.</lang> pravyāharati, {%speaks%}; render, {%she spoke and uttered%} (the following, which directly quotes her speech). <ls>Feer</ls>, {%<fr>sʼécria à haute voix</fr>%}; <ls>Speyer, Index</ls>, does not translate, but attributes ‘inchoative force’ to pra (<ab>i.e.</ab> {%began to speak?%}); this is not supported by <lang>Skt.</lang> or <lang>BHS</lang> usage as far as I know.
