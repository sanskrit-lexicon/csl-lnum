{@nigha@}¦, <lex>m.</lex> (also {@nīgha@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>, and <ab>cf.</ab> {@anigha@}), {%evil, sin%}: <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔7308〕 = <lang>Tib.</lang> <tib>sdig pa</tib>, {%sin%}. In <lang>Pali</lang> only anigha, anīgha seem to be in real use; nigha and nīgha are given in <ab>comms.</ab> and said to mean dukkha; they have the look of abstractions from anigha (anīgha); alternatively the <ab>comms.</ab> analyze an-īgha. Real <ab>etym.</ab> of anigha uncertain. But <lang>BHS</lang> seems clearly to have used nigha, and probably nīgha, independently (<ab>tho</ab> perhaps by secondary backformation from an°).
