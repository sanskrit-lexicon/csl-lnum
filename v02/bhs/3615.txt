{@unmijitakā@}¦ (?), {%a turning sideways%}: in śīrṣonmijitakayā, [Page133-a] <lex>instr.</lex>, <ls>LV</ls> 〔62.21〕 (prose), {%with a turning of their heads to one side%} (they gazed at the Blessed One); of gods. So apparently <lang>Tib.</lang> <tib>mgo byol nas</tib>. Is the word somehow related to un-miñj- (see the <ab>foll.</ab> words)? The only <ab>v.l.</ab> is A śīrṣāmiñjitakāyā; I have thought of śīrsāniñjitakāyā(ḥ), {%with bodies unmoved as to the heads%} (see {@aniñjita@}). But <lang>Tib.</lang> clearly had no such reading (and no word for {%body%}).
