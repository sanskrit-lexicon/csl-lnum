{@mahāśrāvaka@}¦ (= <lang>Pali</lang> mahāsāvaka), {%important disciple%} (of Buddha). In general <lang>BHS</lang>, like <lang>Pali</lang>, knows no definite number or list of them (<ls>Vism.</ls> 〔98.26〕 speaks of the number 80); a typical list of 26 names in <ls>SP</ls> 〔1.9 ff.〕, but at the end it adds, ‘and others’; no number given in <ls>SP</ls> 〔33.5〕; 〔121.1〕; <ls>LV</ls> 〔6.15〕; <ls>Divy</ls> 〔489.11〕, <ab>etc.</ab> Only <ls>Mmk</ls> makes tentative starts at lists; twice it mentions groups of eight: <ls>Mmk</ls> 〔64.9 ff.〕 Śāriputra, Mahāmaudgalyāyana, Mahākāśyapa, Subhūti, Rāhula, Nanda, Bhadrika, Kaphiṇa; but 〔111.11 ff.〕 varies (1—2 = 2—1 of 〔64.9 ff.〕; then Gavāṃpati, Piṇḍola-Bharadvāja, Pilindavatsa, 6 = 5 above, 7 = 3 above, and 8 Ānanda, who in <ls>SP</ls> 〔2.8〕 is a mere śaikṣa, excluded from the mahāśrāvaka group); in <ls>Mmk</ls> 〔40.25〕 Mahākāśyapa and Mahākātyāyana constitute a pair of mahāśr°; in 〔13.22 ff.〕 is a very long list, including some familiar and many fanciful and textually doubtful ones; the same is true of the list of females, mahāśrāvikā, which follows in 〔14.19 ff.〕 (beginning with Yaśodharā); the names in both these lists are omitted here as being largely unreliable.
