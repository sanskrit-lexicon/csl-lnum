{@prabandha@}¦, <lex>m.</lex> (<lang>Skt.</lang>, {%continuation, continuity%}), in <ls>Laṅk</ls> 〔37.10 ff., 38.5 ff., 39.3〕, seems to be nearly a synonym [Page382-a] for pravṛtti (which occurs as <ab>var.</ab> for it in one <ab>ms.</ab> 〔39.3〕; see {@pravṛtti-vijñāna@}), {%continuous activity%} or {%existence%}, <ab>viz.</ab> of vijñāna, contrasted with lakṣaṇa, the {%external mark%} or {%manifested aspect%} (<ls>Suzuki, Studies</ls>, 〔183〕) of vijñāna; both must be subjected to suppression (nirodha); 〔38.5 f.〕 prabandha-nirodhaḥ … yasmān na (so, with <lang>Tib.</lang>) pravartate, {%as a result of which it no longer operates%}; the prabandha of vijñāna is analogous to the relation between atoms of clay and a Jump of clay composed of them, ‘neither different nor not different’, 〔38.9 ff.〕
