? {@pratikūla@}¦, <lex>nt.</lex>, would seem to be a part of a city gate: (teṣāṃ dvārāṇāṃ dvinnāṃ) varṇānāṃ pratikūlaṃ [Page361-b] abhūṣi, suvarṇasya ca rūpyasya ca <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.228.8〕. The parallel passage 〔i.195.10 ff.〕 seems, as far as I see, to have no correspondent, unless far-reaching corruption has concealed relationship. Could this be for *prati-kūṭa, as if {%counter-pinnacle?%}
