{@jina-śrāvaka@}¦, {%pupil of a jina%}, applied in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.118.2, 3〕 to the pupils of Ārāḍa Kālāma, and in 〔ii.119.9, 10〕 to those of Udraka Rāmaputra. <ls>Senart</ls> assumes that this means that these teachers were Jains. But in default of any other evidence this seems unlikely; jina is of course also a title of a Buddha, and we may infer from this that it could be applied to the founder of any religious sect.
