<L>3677<pc>135,1<k1>upadeSeti<k2>upadeSeti (°Sayati)
{@upadeśeti (°śayati)@}¦, {%exhibits, displays%}: <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.169.16〕 jarāṃ ca upadeśenti, na caiṣāṃ vidyate jarā; and 19, ārabdham (? <ab>mss.</ab> alabdhi) upadeśenti eṣā lokānuvartanā (see {@anuvartanā@}). Similarly 〔170.2〕 (they are not born or begotten, yet) mātāpitṛñ ca deśenti eṣā lokānuvartanā; 〔170.10〕 alpotsukatvaṃ pradeśenti eṣā°. The <ab>mg.</ab> is regular for <lang>Skt.</lang> deśayati and for upadiśati, pradiśati, but not recorded for the causatives of the two latter. Nevertheless it seems necessary to keep the <ab>mss.</ab> readings, rather than read (upa-, pra-)darśenti, as <ls>Senart</ls> in his note was tempted to do (and that <ab>altho</ab> forms of darśayati are similarly used in the context, <ab>e.g.</ab> 〔170.4, 6〕).
