{@triḥsahasrā@}¦ (only <lex>f.</lex>) = {@trisahasrā@}, see {@°ra@}; like the latter only in <ab>vss</ab>, and °sah° presumably <ab>m.c.</ab> for °sāh°; printed in <ls>LV</ls> 〔368.7〕 (°rā), 11 (°rā) and 21 (°rāṃ, here with medinī = °nīṃ); all <ab>mss.</ab> in 7 and 21, and all but one (A, the best) in 11, read tri-sah°, <ab>unmetr.</ab>, <ls>Lefm.</ls> <ab>em.</ab> <ab>m.c.</ab>; trī° would be equally satisfactory but A triḥ° in 11; triḥs- can be interpreted as doubling of the sibilant <ab>m.c.</ab>, but doubtless influence of tris, {%thrice%}, is involved. No noun accompanies the (substantivized) <lex>adj.</lex> in 7, 11.
