{@utkumbhati@}¦, <ab>prob.</ab> {%rears%} (of a balky horse; so guessed from context): <ls>KP</ls> 〔108.2〕 (yatra …) aśva(ḥ) skhalati utkumbhati vā khaḍunka- (<ab>q.v.</ab>)-kriyā vā karoti, {%when a horse stumbles or rears or acts viciously%}. <lang>Tib.</lang> seems to have no correspondent for this word; the several <lang>Chin.</lang> versions, likewise, fail to clarify it; they seem to have only two verbal expressions for three of the <lang>BHS</lang>.
