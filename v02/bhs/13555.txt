<hom>2</hom> {@Vālikā@}¦ (text Bāl°), <ab>n.</ab> of a Licchavi woman; and {@Vālikāchavī@} (text Bāl°, with 1 <ab>ms.</ab> Bālika-, <ab>v.l.</ab> Pārikalecchavī, which suggests that the second member was a form of the tribal name!), <ab>n.</ab> of a place donated by her to the Buddha and the order (identified by <ls>Senart</ls> with Pāli Vālikārāma, <ab>v.l.</ab> Vālukā°; <lang>Pali</lang> seems to know no Vālikā; the <ab>v.l.</ab> suggests the word for {%sand%}): <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.300.17〕, printed, bālikāye bhagavataḥ saśrāvakasaṃghasya bhaktaṃ kṛtvā Bālikāchavī niryātitā. Does the name of the place mean {%Vālikāʼs radiance%}, or {%having a covering of sand%} (the womanʼs name being secondarily based upon the place name)?
