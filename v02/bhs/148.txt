{@aghaniṣṭha@}¦, doubtless understood as {%sky-based%} (see {@agha@}, 1), a class of gods: <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔3107〕, where it follows {@akaniṣṭha@}, of which it is surely nothing but a folk-etymological distortion. So <ls>Wogihara, Lex.</ls> It occurs in no other of my texts unless in <ls>Bbh</ls>; <ls>Wogihara</ls> reads so in 〔62.6〕 and 〔68.5〕; actually it is read only in the latter place by one of the two <ab>mss.</ab> (which reads aniṣṭha in the former place), while the other <ab>ms.</ab> reads akaniṣṭha both times. <ls>Wogihara</ls>ʼs suggested interpretation, and those he quotes from Yaśomitra and <lang>Chin.</lang>, seem to me fantastic and worthless. <ab>Cf.</ab> {@lokaniṣṭha@}.
