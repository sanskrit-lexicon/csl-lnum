{@Nīla-kāyika@}¦, <ab>n.</ab> of a class of gods, noted only in <ls>LV</ls> 〔383.9〕 °kair devaputrair, and 11 {@Vairocano@} (<ab>q.v.</ab>, 7) nāma Nīlakāyiko devaputraḥ. I have been unable to find anything more about this term. <lang>Tib.</lang> renders <tib>sṅon po</tib> ({%blue%}) <tib>ris</tib> ({%form, figure%}; also {%party%}, like <lang>BHS</lang> {@kāya@}). This suggests that <lang>Tib.</lang> understood {%belonging to the group of Nīla (blue) ones%}, rather than {%blue-bodied%}. In <ls>LV</ls> they, and their spokesman Vairocana, seem to be superior to the four {@mahārāja@} gods.
