{@grahaṇa@}¦, <lex>nt.</lex>, confused with {@gahana@}, {%thicket, entanglement%} (?): in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.34.7〕 (prose) -durga-saṃsāra-kāntāragrahaṇa-dāruṇāto mahā-prapātāto uddharitvā, <ls>Senart</ls> thinks that grahaṇa is a copyistʼs hyper-<lang>Skt.</lang> alteration of gahana, which is a near-synonym of kāntāra (<ab>esp.</ab> in <lang>Pali</lang>, where diṭṭhi-kantāra and diṭṭhi-gahana are often closely associated); in spite of this, I think grahaṇa may be sound and <ab>orig.</ab>: {%rescuing from a great abyss that is dreadful because of the grip of the forest of the saṃsāra <ab>etc.</ab>%} In <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.91.14—17〕 occur four lines of verse in which the <ab>mss.</ab> repeatedly vary between gahana and grahaṇa; the text is both very corrupt and fragmentary; <ls>Senartʼs note</ls> is a very earnest effort to disentangle it, but I find it hardly convincing, <ab>tho</ab> I am inclined to agree that puns are here contained, involving gahana, {%entanglement, obstruction, difficulty%}, as well as {%thicket%}, and grahaṇa, {%seizure, imprisonment%} (perhaps also {%eclipse%}, as by Rāhu, so <lang>Skt.</lang>); the text, with the most important <ab>vv.ll.</ab>, reads: 14 vanagahanaṃ (<ab>mss.</ab> °grahanaṃ or °ṇaṃ) balagahanaṃ (3 <ab>mss.</ab> °grah°) girigahanāni (<ab>em.</ab>; 5 <ab>mss.</ab> °gahanaṃ, one °grahaṇaṃ) tyāgagrahaṇāni (3 <ab>mss.</ab> °gahanāni), 15 viṣamāprati- (<ab>mss.</ab> viṣamapati-)-saṃniṣaṇṇavanāni tu manuṣyagahanāni (5 <ab>mss.</ab> °graha°), 16 tṛṇagulmakaṇṭakalatākulāni vṛkṣagrahaṇā- (<ab>mss.</ab> °grahaṇya- or °nya-)gahanāni (3 <ab>mss.</ab> grahaṇāni), 17 śaṭhanikṛtipaiśunyāni tu manuṣyagahanāni (5 <ab>mss.</ab> °grahanāni or °ṇāni). Tho <ls>Senart</ls>ʼs interpretation seems very dubious, I cannot suggest with confidence any improvements. The meter is meant for āryā. See also {@gahana, gahana-tā@}.
