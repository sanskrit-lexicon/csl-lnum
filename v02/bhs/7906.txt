{@Dhānyadrāhyāyaṇa@}¦ (so read for <ab>ed.</ab> °drāyāyaṇa; see the readings of the corrupt <ab>mss.</ab>, some of which support this, the obviously correct reading), <ab>pl.</ab>, <ab>n.</ab> of a brahmanical gotra: <ls>Divy</ls> 〔635.19〕. This passage is omitted in two <lang>Chin.</lang> translations, my colleague <ls>Prof. Rahder</ls> informs me. <ab>Cf.</ab> {@Dhyāna-drāhyāyaṇī@}, where <lang>Chin.</lang> seems more favorable to initial Dhā- rather than Dhyā-. It seems that one or the other of these two must be an error, and perhaps Dhānya- should be read in both.
