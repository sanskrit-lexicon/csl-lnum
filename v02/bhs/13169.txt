{@Vajrapāṇi@}¦ (in <lang>Skt.</lang> <ab>ep.</ab> of Indra; in <lang>Pali</lang> Vajirapāṇi is <ab>n.</ab> of a yakkha, also of Indra, the two being identified, at least sometimes; on his character see <ls>DPPN</ls>; in <lang>BHS</lang> sometimes = Indra, as in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.183.10〕 where his form is assumed by Buddha; <ab>prob.</ab> also in <ls>Gv</ls> 〔250.20〕, where he parallels, and forms the climax of, a series of devatās; and <ab>prob.</ab> <ls>SP</ls> 〔445.6〕), <ab>n.</ab> of a yakṣa, <ls>Māy</ls> 〔3〕 (living at Rājagṛha); <ab>cf.</ab> {@Vajra-rājagṛha@}; usually not, as in <ls>Māy</ls>, a mere local yakṣa, but a much more imposing and even terrifying yakṣa, who <ab>e.g.</ab> in <ls>Bbh</ls> 〔152.1〕 may be conjured up by a Bodhisattva to frighten evil-doers (<ab>cf.</ab> also {@Caṇḍavajrapāṇi@}); often called by epithets like mahāyakṣasenāpati <ls>Suv</ls> 〔85.3〕, {@guhyakādhipati@} 〔91.17〕 (see the word, and <ab>cf.</ab> <ls>LV</ls> 〔66.6〕), yakṣendra 〔158.13〕; similarly <ls>Mmk</ls> 〔548.7〕, and often; elsewhere he is an important Bodhisattva, at or near the head of lists of them, <ls>Kv</ls> 〔1.7〕; <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔649〕; one of eight, <ls>Dharmas</ls> 〔12〕; a special attendant on Buddha <ls>Laṅk</ls> 〔240.10〕; a Bodhisattva in the 8th bhūmi is Vajrapāṇisatatānubaddha, <ls>Dbh</ls> 〔71.22〕; other references to <ab n="Vajrapāṇi">V.</ab> the Bodhisattva, <ls>Śikṣ</ls> 〔274.3〕; <ls>Sādh</ls> 〔49.13〕 <ab>etc.</ab>; <ls>Mmk</ls> 〔11.6〕; 〔62.28〕; 〔68.20〕, <ab>etc.</ab>; it is clear, however, that for <ls>Mmk</ls>, at least, the Bodhisattva and the yakṣa or guhyaka prince are the same person; so Vajrapāṇir bodhisattvo 〔25.8〕 is referred to in 12 as {@(Ā)guhyakādhipatinā@} yakṣendreṇa; in addressing Vajrapāṇiṃ guhyakādhipatim, 〔36.2〕, he is called {@jinaputra@} (= bodhisattva) in the next line; he is called a bodhisattva in 〔145.2〕 and 13, and addressed as yakṣeśa in 14.
