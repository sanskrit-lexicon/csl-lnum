{@kṣepayati@}¦, ({@1@}) {%spends, passes%} (time, with <lex>acc.</lex> kālam or some expression of time), is found in <lang>Skt.</lang> (<ls>BR</ls> 〔5.1349〕), and the simple kṣipati is commoner in that sense (<lat><ab>ibidem</ab></lat>). It is strange that <ls>Senart</ls>, <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i. n. 492〕, <ls>PTSD</ls> on khepeti (<ab>s.v.</ab> khipati), and others have overlooked that fact, regarded the usage as specifically <lang>Pali</lang>-<lang>BHS</lang>, and assumed confusion with kṣi, {%destroy%}. I have, to be sure, found no record of kṣepayati used absolutely in this sense in <lang>Skt.</lang>, as it is in <ls>LV</ls> 〔276.11〕 (<ab>vs</ab>) brahmaśakrabhavane nityaṃ sukhaṃ kṣepituṃ, {%to spend%} (time) {%happily forever in the home of <ab n="Brahman">B.</ab> and <ab n="Śakra">Ś.</ab>%} ({@2@}) {%exhausts, brings to an end, obliterates%}; here influence of kṣi, {%destroy%}, might more reasonably be suspected, yet <lang>Skt.</lang> kṣip is sometimes used in nearly or quite the same sense, <ls>BR</ls> <ab>s.v.</ab> kṣip 7 (〔2.549〕; but as <ls>BR</ls> suspected, <ls>Mbh.</ls> <ed>Calc.</ed> 〔3.1094〕 should be read kṣīyeran, not kṣiperan, see <ab>Crit. ed.</ab> 〔3.30.30〕); it <ab>prob.</ab> is an extension of the meaning {%spend%} (time). So <ls>Divy</ls> 〔367.8〕 (narakavedanīyāni karmāṇi) kṣepayitvā, {%having spent (exhausted) their deeds that had to be suffered-for in hells%}, which may illustrate the transition from {%spend%} (time) to {%exhaust%}; the change is complete in <ls>LV</ls> 〔237.13〕 (<ab>vs</ab>) saptarātra bhaṇamānu … sā viyūha na pi śakya kṣepituṃ, {%<ab>tho</ab> described for a week, this splendor could not be exhausted (‘spent’)%}. But it is doubtful whether any of these uses are strictly non-<lang>Skt.</lang>
