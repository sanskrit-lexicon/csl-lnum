? {@saṃkīyati@}¦, in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.37.9〕, text, tām eva agragaṇikāṃ °yanto śayito, presumably understood as {%went to bed thinking about that courtesan%} (and enjoyed her in dreams all night). The form is very dubious; it cannot = <lang>Pali</lang> saṃkīyati which is <lex>pass.</lex> to {@saṃkirati@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>, and not connected with <lang>Pali</lang> saṅkati, <lang>Skt.</lang> śaṅkate (<ls>PTSD</ls> connects it with both at once!), <ab>Chap.</ab> 43, <ab>s.v.</ab> <ab n="?">śaṅk.</ab> If our form is right, I can only understand it as a <lang>MIndic</lang> passive to <lang>Skt.</lang> <lex>caus.</lex> śaṅkayati, {%makes concerned%}; it would then mean, {%being made concerned with …%} There is a <ab>v.l.</ab> sakrīḍanto; read saṃkrīḍanto, {%amusing himself%} (in thoughts)?
