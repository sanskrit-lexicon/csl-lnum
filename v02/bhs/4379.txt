{@katara@}¦, <lex>pron.</lex> <lex>adj.</lex> (see also {@katira@}; <ab>cf.</ab> {@anyatara@}; used in this way sometimes in <lang>Pali</lang> and apparently even in <lang>Skt.</lang>, where however the cases are rare and not always certain), {%which%} (of more than two)?: <ls>Divy</ls> 〔102.17〕; 〔308.8〕; 〔371.23〕 kataraḥ (of several) kumāro … rājā bhaviṣyati; <ls>Śikṣ</ls> 〔75.4〕; <ls>KP</ls> 〔97.4〕 kataraṃ (cited <ls>Śikṣ</ls> 〔233.15〕 as katarat) cittaṃ; <ls>MSV</ls> 〔iii.136.10〕 (read kataraṃ tat), 12. In <ls>LV</ls> 〔239.15〕 (Ārāḍasya dharmo …) na niryāti tat-katarasya samyagduḥkhakṣayāya, and <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.119.5〕 (nāyaṃ) Ārāḍasya dharmo niryāti tat-katarasya (so <ab>mss.</ab>) samyagduḥkhakṣayāye, could at best (but implausibly) be taken to mean {%<ab n="Ārāḍa">Ā.</ab>ʼs religion does not result in the complete destruction of the misery of anyone%}. But <ls>Senart</ls> emended to tat-karasya, {%of (for) the one who performs it%} (<ab>sc.</ab> <ab n="Ārāḍa">Ā.</ab>ʼs religion), which is confirmed by <lang>Tib.</lang> on <ls>LV</ls> <tib>de byed pa</tib>, {%one who has done that%}. It is indeed strange to find the same corruption in both texts; but the <ab>em.</ab> seems quite certain; it is confirmed by <lang>Pali</lang> takkarassa <ls>DN</ls> 〔i.235.17〕; <ls>MN</ls> 〔i.68.12〕, in a quite similar phrase; and in a close parallel <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.120.16〕 one <ab>ms.</ab> reads tatkarasya (the other corruptly taktenasya).
