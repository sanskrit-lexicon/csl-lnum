{@galita@}¦, of Buddhaʼs voice, perhaps {%fluent%}: <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.315.3〕 [Page211-a] °tam (so or °tam <ab>mss.</ab>; <ls>Senart</ls> <ab>em.</ab> gaditaṃ, but his note retracts the <ab>em.</ab>) āviṣṭaṃ bhāṣati, <ab>metr.</ab> dubious; 〔i.171.11〕 galita-pada-saṃcayavatī, of Buddhaʼs voice. It would perhaps be rash to read agalita, which is used in <lang>Pali</lang> in the sense of {%(not dropping,) fluent, distinct, agreeable%} (<ls>CPD</ls>). Relation of the two forms obscure.
