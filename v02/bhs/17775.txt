{@heluka@}¦ (<lex>m.</lex> or <lex>nt.</lex>), a high number: <ls>Gv</ls> 〔106.3〕; <ab>prob.</ab> a doublet for the next, for which the same line also has {@loka@} (read {@aloka@} or {@āl°@}), before this, and separated from it only by {@indriya@} which no other list contains; this, like {@heluga@} in <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔7741〕, is followed by {@durbuda@} (<ls>Mvy</ls> drabuddha), and then by {@haruṇa@} (in both alike).
