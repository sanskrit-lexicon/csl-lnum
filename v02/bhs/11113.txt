? {@bhaṅgakula@}¦, <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.251.6〕, in a list of enemies of birds, all <lex>gen.</lex> <ab>pl.</ab>, after sākuntikānām (śā°), cāṇḍālakānām (<ab>mss.</ab> ca°), mṛgalubdhakānām, biḍālakroṣṭukānām, and nakulānām, comes (in text) bhaṅgakulānām (but <ab>mss.</ab> both °kulān; one <ab>ms.</ab> bhaṅgeṇa—so, ṇ!—for bhaṅga-). <ls>Senart</ls> thinks of muṅgusa-kulānām (<lang>Pali</lang> <ab>Lex.</ab> muṅgusa, {%mongoose%}, <ls>Childers</ls>); closer to the <ab>mss.</ab> would be <lang>AMg.</lang> maṅgusa, <ab>id.</ab> As <ls>Senart</ls> notes, this would seem to duplicate nakulānām, the preceding term. Possibly, however, maṅgusānām may have been the <ab>orig.</ab> reading, the last part corrupted by confusion with nakula. It might, possibly, have designated a different species of {%mongoose%} from nakula, which would justify the collocation of the two words.
