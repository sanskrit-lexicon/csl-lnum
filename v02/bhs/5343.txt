{@kṣatra@}¦ (<lex>nt.</lex>) = kṣetra, {%field%}. <ab>Cf.</ab> <lang>Pali</lang> <ls>DN</ls> 〔3.93.13〕 khettānaṃ patī ti … khattiyo (in an etymology), which shows that a popular association of kṣatriya with kṣetra (or of their <lang>MIndic</lang> equivalents) existed. Doubtless as a result of this, the secondary etymological blend-form kṣatra occurs often in <ls>LV</ls>, as in 〔208.13〕; 〔283.8〕; 〔352.18〕; 〔354.14, 22〕; 〔355.16〕; 〔357.4〕; 〔366.8〕; in all these all <ab>mss.</ab> and <ls>Lefm.</ls> kṣa°; in <ls>LV</ls> 〔290.8, 15〕; 〔353.1〕 <ls>Lefm.</ls> kṣe° but most <ab>mss.</ab> kṣa°. The <ab>mss.</ab> of <ls>Mv</ls> also—sometimes nearly all of them—read kṣa°, as in <ab>v.l.</ab> for kṣe° at 〔i.121.9, 11, 12〕; 〔122.1, 2〕. In all these cases there is no doubt of the <ab>mg.</ab> {%field%}; it seems to me that <ls>Lefm.</ls> was right in recognizing the existence in <lang>BHS</lang> of kṣatra in this sense, because of its frequent occurrence, which the <ab>etym.</ab> in <ls>DN</ls> supports.
