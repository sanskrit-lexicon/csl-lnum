<hom>2</hom> {@Prakṛti@}¦, <ab>n.</ab> of an outcaste girl (mātaṅga-dārikā): <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔3665〕; <ls>Divy</ls> 〔611.6 ff.〕; also of a previous incarnation of the same person, when she was a brahmanʼs daughter, <ls>Divy</ls> 〔620.22 ff.〕 <ab>Acc.</ab> to <ls>Senart</ls>, 〔i.xliv infra〕, also <ab>n.</ab> of another girl, who plays a role in the story of {@Megha@}; but I believe this is an error. The girl is introduced but not named <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.232.13〕; she is then referred to as prakṛti (for °tī) māṇavikā 〔232.16〕, and, in oblique forms, °tiye °vikāye 〔233.14〕; 〔238.3〕; there is no indication that these passages state her name, and I believe they contain the <lang>Skt.</lang> <lex>adj.</lex> (<lex>ppp.</lex>) prakṛta, {%above-mentioned%} (<ls>BR</ls> 〔2.95〕), in <lex>fem.</lex> form (°tī, 〔§ 11.3〕).
