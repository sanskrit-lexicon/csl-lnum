This seems to me indicated by adjoining parallel terms, <ab>esp.</ab> {@paramata@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>, which <ls>Senart</ls> misunderstands: (bodhisattvacaritaṃ …) jātakāparamateṣu kovidā (deśayanti … īśvarā) <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.104.13〕 (<ab>vs</ab>; kā for -ka, <ab>m.c.</ab>), {%the Lords%} (Buddhas), {%being skilled in nativities%} (indicating personality and destiny; or, future births) {%and in the thoughts of others, proclaim the%} (future!) {%course of Bodhisattvas …%}; (yānīmāni) … jātakāni jinabhāṣitāni imāni kutaḥprabhṛtikāni vijñeyāni (? <ab>em.</ab>; <ab>mss.</ab> ciṃhneyāni) 〔105.5〕, answered by: yānīmāni … jātakāni jinabhāṣitāni imāṃ aṣṭamīṃ bhūmiṃ (so some <ab>mss.</ab>) prapadyanti (<ab>v.l.</ab> prayanti) 〔105.7〕; the <ab>mg.</ab>, as <ls>Senart</ls> suggests, seems (from -prabhṛtikāni) to be that they {%begin%} with the 8th bhūmi; but as this passage occurs in a description of the 4th bhūmi, it is {%future%} births or destines that are meant. In 〔i.192.19〕 (<ab>vs</ab>), after saṃbuddhāḥ sarvaparamataṃ viduḥ 18, {%Buddhas know all the thoughts of others%}, we read: adhyāśayaṃ parīkṣanti jātakā sarvaprāṇināṃ, {%they perceive the disposition and the destinies%} (future births) {%of all living beings%}.
