{@Dharmacinti(n)@}¦, {%‘thinking on the Doctrine’%}, perhaps <ab>n.</ab> of a previous incarnation of Śākyamuni (otherwise unrecorded): <ls>LV</ls> 〔170.17〕 (<ab>vs</ab>). <lang>Tib.</lang> <tib>chos sems</tib> confirms the meaning; but it lacks the connective <tib>daṅ</tib>, which occurs after each of the other three names in the line; accordingly it seems to have understood this word as an epithet of the following Arcimān.
