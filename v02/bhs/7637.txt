{@dviruttarapadasaṃdhi-lipi@}¦, a kind of writing: <ls>LV</ls> 〔126.8〕; <lang>Tib.</lang> <tib>tshig lan lan gñis su gdab paḥi tshig gi mtshams kyi (yi ge)</tib>, which <ls>Foucaux</ls> renders, {%<fr>(écriture) du saṃdhi (liaison) dʼun mot répété deux fois</fr>%}, which does not make much sense to me, nor can I see how it renders the <lang>Tib.</lang> (which however I find obscure). The text continues: yāvaddaśottarapadasaṃdhi-lipiṃ; this time <lang>Tib.</lang> is rather different, <tib>tshig gi mtshams bcur brgyud paḥi bar gyi (yi ge)</tib>, which <ls>Foucaux</ls> renders as before (with {%ten%} for {%two%}); it seems to mean {%writing up to a series of ten%} (forming) {%a combination of words%}, or {%writing of combinations of words in which up to ten words follow one another%}. Possibly dviruttara° means no more than {%writing of two words in combination%}.
