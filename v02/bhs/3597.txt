{@udvedha@}¦ (<lex>m.</lex>? = <lang>Pali</lang> ubbedha, defined as {%height%}; <lang>AMg.</lang> uvveha, defined by <ls>Ratnach.</ls> only as {%depth%}; <lang>Pkt.</lang> uvveha, <ab>acc.</ab> to <ls>Sheth</ls> {%height%} or {%depth%}, also zamīn-ka avagāha, {%penetration of the ground[?]%}), {%height%} (so surely in most cases): <ls>Śikṣ</ls> 〔246.5〕 lokadhātuḥ saṃtiṣṭhate, caturaśītiryojanasahasrāṇy udvedhena; <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.196.17〕; 〔iii.229.14〕; 〔232.10〕 (yaṣṭi, or yaṣṭī …) dvādaśayojanāni udvedhena; <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.196.2〕 (iṣikāni, so text …) dvādaśapauruṣā udvedhena; here preceded by figures relating to {%depth%} (extent of penetration of the ground), see {@naikhanya@}, and {%circumference%} (? see {@parigohya@}); in a close parallel, <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.228.13〕, (iṣīkāni …) dvādaśapuruṣa-udvedhena (<ab>mss.</ab> udvehena, uddehena) is preceded by the statement of depth ({@naikhanya@}) and by a form read by <ls>Senart</ls> tripauruṣoccāni, which would refer to {%height%} and so be inconsistent with udvedhena (which, however, if it meant {%depth%}, would be inconsistent with the preceding form containing naikhanya); it seems that <ls>Senart</ls> should have assumed -parigohya [Page132-b] (as in 〔i.196.2〕; or some form relating to {%circumference%}) instead of -ucca (<ab>mss.</ab> read -pauruṣaroccāni or -puruṣaroddhā, perhaps showing, in the syllable -ro-, a faint trace of that original). <ls>Senart</ls> himself saw this in his note on 〔i.196.2〕, but overlooked it on 〔iii.228.13〕. <ab>Cf.</ab> {@āvedha, pravedha@}.
