{@sattvāvāsa@}¦, <lex>m.</lex> (= <lang>Pali</lang> sattāvāsa), {%abode of beings%}. Nine such are listed <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔2288—97〕 and in <lang>Pali</lang> <ls>DN</ls> 〔iii.263.9 ff.〕; in both lists an example only (not an exhaustive enumeration) is cited under each ‘abode’. The first includes all men and lower beings, and the kāmāvacara gods; the 2d, 3d, and 4th are the gods of the 1st, 2d, and 3d dhyānabhūmi (of the rūpāvacara gods); then in <ls>Mvy</ls> come as <ab>Nos.</ab> 5—8 <ab>incl.</ab> the 4 classes of arūpāvacara gods, and finally as an example of 〔No. 9〕 the {@asaṃjñisattva@} (<ab>q.v.</ab>) gods; but this arrangement is certainly erroneous; <ls>DN</ls> 〔iii.263.19〕 correctly puts the asaññasatta gods (who belong to the 4th dhyānabhūmi of rūpāvacara) in the 5th satt(v)āvāsa (the śuddhāvāsakāyika doubtless belong here too), while the four arūpāvacara classes constitute the 6th to 9th <ab>incl.</ab> In <ls>Mvy</ls> the first four are characterized respectively as nānātvakāyā nānātvasaṃjñinaḥ, nānātvakāyā ekatvasaṃjñinaḥ, ekatvakāyā nānātvasaṃjñinaḥ, ekatvakāyā ekatvasaṃjñinaḥ. <ab>Cf.</ab> <ls>AbhidhK.
