{@itthatva@}¦, <lex>nt.</lex> (= <lang>Pali</lang> itthatta), {%the being in this world%}: <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.447.8〕 (kṣīṇā me jātir …) noparim itthatvam iti prajānāti. Recorded as icchatva <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.52.7〕 devanikāyato cyavitvā icchatvam āgacchanti, and in similar phrases 〔52.8〕; 〔338.18〕; 〔ii.133.4〕. <ls>Senart</ls> allows icchatva to stand, regarding it as a genuine phonetic alternative form (〔i.417〕); and all <ab>mss.</ab> read so in these passages. But in view of 〔iii.447.8〕 it seems to me likely that icchatva is a mere graphic corruption, 〔§ 2.22〕. See however {@icchatva@}.
