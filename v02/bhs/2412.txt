{@asaṃjñi-sattva@}¦ (= <lang>Pali</lang> asañña-satta), {%having a nature that is free from consciousness%}, or <ab>acc.</ab> to <ls>CPD</ls> {%Unconscious Beings%}, <ab>n.</ab> of a class of gods (see <ab>s.v.</ab> {@deva@}), one (in <ls>Dharmas</ls> and <ls>LV</ls> the 4th) of the classes of rūpāvacara gods of the 4th dhyāna-bhūmi (missing in the other standard lists of gods, but required to make up the standard count of 18 classes of gods in <lang>BHS</lang> or 16 in <lang>Pali</lang>): <ls>Dharmas</ls> 〔128〕; <ls>LV</ls> 〔150.9〕; <ls>Divy</ls> 〔505.23〕 (see <ab>s.v.</ab> {@āsaṃjñika@}); in <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔2297〕 mentioned as an example of dwellers in the 9th and highest {@sattvāvāsa@}, but this is certainly an error; they belong in the 5th sattvāvāsa, see this word. This is confirmed <ls>AbhidhK. LaV-P.</ls> 〔ii.199〕. <lex>f.</lex>, where the name is discussed, and it is said that they dwell in (a specially high part of) the {@bṛhatphala@} heaven.
