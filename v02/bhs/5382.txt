{@kṣudra-pāka@}¦, <lex>adj.</lex>, {%very ripe%}, of fruits in the last month of summer: <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.143.(14—)15〕 (grīṣmāṇāṃ) paścime māse kṣudrapākāni phalāni bhuktāni, whereupon he was thirsty, drank much cold water, and got indigestion; substantially the same, 〔144.5〕; 〔153.10〕; the <ab>mg.</ab> seems guaranteed by 〔154.6〕 where pakva-supakvāni replaces kṣudrapākāni, in what is otherwise virtually the same phrase. <ab>Cf.</ab> <lang>Skt.</lang> svādupāka, defined <ls>BR</ls> as {%<ger>was sich süss, angenehm kocht</ger>%}, <ger><ab>d.h.</ab></ger> {%<ger>verdaut</ger>%}; {@kṣudra@} here means {%honey-like = sweet%} (see <ab>s.v.</ab>). In <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.154.14〕 the ṛṣi who had the above adventure squeezes such fruits (so that the juice falls) into the mouth of the infant born to the doe who drank his seed: ṛṣi kṣudrapākāni phalāni mukhe pīḍeti. The interpretation is further confirmed by <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.145.2〕 kṣudra-kṣudrāṇi phalāni (on which see {@kṣudra@}), of the fruits fed by the ṛṣi to the young Ekaśṛṅga(ka). It seems that the ṛṣiʼs indigestion was caused by the excessive amount of cold water he drank, not by the fruits.
