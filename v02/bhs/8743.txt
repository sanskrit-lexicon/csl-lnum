{@Pakṣu@}¦, <ab>n.</ab> of a nāga king: °ur <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔3307〕. <ab>Cf.</ab> {@Vakṣu@}. <lang>Tib.</lang> <tib>Pag-śu</tib>. But it seems to be a river-name; the three preceding names are Gaṅgā-, Sindhur, and Sītā-nāgarājā; similarly in <ls>MSV</ls> 〔i.164.1〕. (Nāgas are often thought of as living in rivers, as is well known; <ab>cf.</ab> <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔3304—6〕.) Since Vakṣu occurs as <ab>n.</ab> of a river in <lang>Skt.</lang>, it is probably the correct form.
