It must be noted, however, that the meaning {%discouragement, mental trouble%} (as in {@a-paritasyana@} <ab>etc.</ab>, <ab>cf.</ab> {@paritasyati, °tras°@}) would be possible in the above <ls>AsP</ls> passage, and could also be the meaning of {@utkaṇṭhā@}, as in <lang>Pali</lang> ukkaṇṭhā and <lang>BHS</lang> {@utkaṇṭhati@}; the disappearance of the vision could lead to {%depression%} of mind, as well as to {%eager desire%} to see it again.
