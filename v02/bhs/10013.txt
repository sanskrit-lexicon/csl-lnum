{@pratipad@}¦, <lex>f.</lex>, also {@°dā@} (= <lang>Pali</lang> paṭipadā), {%course of conduct, practice, behavior%}, <ab>esp.</ab> {%good, approved behavior%}, = {@pratipatti@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>; <ab>acc.</ab> to <ls>Childers</ls> and <ls>PTSD</ls>, so also primarily <lang>Pali</lang> paṭipadā; this <ab>mg.</ab> is recognized by <ls>Speyer on Av</ls> 〔ii.130.2〕, which he reads by <ab>em.</ab> araṇya-°daṃ samādāya (better, I think araṇāṃ pra°, see <ab>s.v.</ab> {@araṇya@}; in that case render {%passionless way of behavior%}); he also accepts this <ab>mg.</ab> in puṇyāṃ pratipadam udbhāvayan dānadamasaṃyamādibhiḥ <ls>Jm</ls> 〔100.10〕, {%displaying meritorious behavior by …%}; vākpragraheṇa pratipanmayena <ls>Jm</ls> 〔105.2〕, {%by%} (the kind of) {%acceptance of his words which consists of behavior%}, <ab>i.e.</ab> by not only assenting verbally but putting them into practice; (anayāpi … caryayānayāpi) pratipadā <ls>LV</ls> 〔263.11〕 (pratipad = caryā), and similarly 〔264.18〕; often rendered {%way, path%}, and called ‘a quasi-synonym of magga’ in <ls>PTSD</ls>; this is due to the fact that the {%middle course of conduct%}, madhyamā pratipad(ā), is (in <lang>BHS</lang> as in <lang>Pali</lang>) identified with the eight-fold way (mārga) stated in the fourth Noble Truth, but the terms are quite differently defined, ma° pra° being the course of {%behavior%} which steers between the two extremes (anta) of violent asceticism and worldliness; the lack of real synonymity between <lang>Pali</lang> magga and paṭipadā is shown, <ab>e.g.</ab>, by <ls>DN</ls> 〔ii.154.25—26〕 (kaṅkhā vā vimati vā) Buddhe vā dhamme vā saṃghe vā magge vā paṭipadāya vā (obviously different things must be meant); madhyamayaiva pratipadā <ls>LV</ls> 〔416.21〕 (contrasted with amadhyamā pratipad = violent asceticism, 〔416.19〕); here as elsewhere such a statement introduces the Four Noble Truths, the fourth of which is duḥkhanirodhagāminī pratipad (with or without āryasatyam, in <ls>LV</ls> 〔417.3, 12〕 without it, in 12 = eṣa evāryāṣṭāṅgamārgaḥ); so <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔1314, 1319, 1324〕; <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.138.5〕 (with āryasatyam) and 10 (without it); 〔285.4〕 (without it); <ls>SP</ls> 〔179.3〕 (with it); more metaphysical interpretations of the term madhyamā pratipad in <ls>Bbh</ls> 〔39.26〕; <ls>KP</ls> 〔52.6〕 and repeatedly in following sections; one of the ten bala of a Tathāgata is sarvatragāmanī-pratipaj-jñānam <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔125〕, <ab>cf.</ab> sarvatragāminī-(the more usual form)-pratipatti-jñāna-balam <ls>Dharmas</ls> 〔76〕 (note obvious equivalence of pratipad and pratipatti!), {%power of knowledge of courses of conduct which may lead to any result%}; in same context sarvatragāminīṃ ca pratipadaṃ (<ab>v.l.</ab> °dāṃ) vetti <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.159.13〕 (<ab>vs</ab>), and, for another, see <ab>s.v.</ab> {@pratipadā@}; parānukampā-pratipad <ls>Jm</ls> 〔28.7〕, {%conducting oneself with compassion for others%}; nairyāṇika- (and °kī) pratipad, see <ab>s.v.</ab> {@nairyāṇika@}; śaikṣa-pratipady uttarikaraṇīyam (see this) <ls>Sukh</ls> 〔2.13〕, {%in the course%} ({%practice%}; here we could also, no doubt, translate {%path%}) of the {@śaikṣa@} (<ab>q.v.</ab>); there are four {%courses of conduct%} (<lang>Tib.</lang> <tib>lam</tib>, {%way, path%}, but also {%manner of conduct%}) <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔1244—1248〕, <ab>viz</ab> duḥkhā pra° dhandhābhijñā, sukhā pra° dhandhābhijñā, duḥkhā pra° kṣiprābhijñā, sukhā pra° kṣiprā° (for the corresponding <lang>Pali</lang> list, and interpretation, see <ls>Childers</ls> <ab>s.v.</ab> paṭipadā).
