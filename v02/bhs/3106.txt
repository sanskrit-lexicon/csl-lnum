{@āhāraka@}¦, <lex>m.</lex>, in <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔3851〕, <ab>acc.</ab> to <lang>Tib.</lang> <tib>sñod ciṅ stobs pa</tib>, which seems to mean someone concerned with food; so also <lang>Chin.</lang> <ab>Prob.</ab> this is etymological guesswork (<lang>Skt.</lang> āhāra). Certainly it refers to some member of a shipʼs crew; see {@āhāra, āharaṇa@}; perhaps {%one who tows%} (or otherwise propels?) {%a boat%}, as in <lang>Pali</lang> āharitvā (nāvaṃ) <ls>Jāt.</ls> 〔iv.159.16〕.
