{@samānārthatā@}¦ (in <lang>Pali</lang> samānattatā, as if *samānātmatā, is the 4th saṃgahavatthu), {%equality%}, ({@1@}) in general sense: <ls>LV</ls> 〔239.13〕 māṃ (<ab>sc.</ab> the Bodhisattva) °tayā saṃsthāpayati sma, {%he%} (Ārāḍa Kālāpa = °ma) {%set me on terms of equality with himself%}; in same incident <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.119.4〕 samānārthatāye sthāpayet; ({@2@}) as one of the 4 {@saṃgrahavastu@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>, <ab>acc.</ab> to <ls>Bbh</ls> 〔225.21 ff.〕 and <ls>Sūtrāl.</ls> 〔xvi.72〕, (a Bodhisattvaʼs) {%adoption of the same%} (religious) {%aims for himself which he preaches to others%}; in lists of the 4 saṃgraha-vastu occurs <ls>LV</ls> 〔38.17〕; 〔160.7〕; 〔182.6〕; 〔429.13〕; <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.395.9〕; <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔928〕; <ls>Dharmas</ls> 〔19〕. But in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.3.12〕 the 4th saṃgraha-vastu is given, instead, as {@samāna-sukhaduḥkhatā@} (<ab>mss.</ab> confused), <ab>i.e.</ab> {%having the same joys and sorrows%} (with others), or {%sympathy%}; this may have been the older interpretation, and seems to fit better the <lang>Pali</lang> equivalent (above), which is so interpreted <ls>DN comm.</ls> 〔iii.928.10 ff.〕 The definition in <ls>Bbh</ls> and <ls>Sūtrāl.</ls> may then be a late interpretation of pedantic Mahāyāna metaphysicians.
