{@bhrūṇa-dheya@}¦ (see {@-dheya@}), in °yam idaṃ cittaṃ niḥsāram anidarśanam <ls>Ud</ls> 〔xxxi.4〕. This <ab>cpd.</ab> of -dheya not recorded in <lang>Pali</lang>; is it a false <ab>Sktization</ab> of the troublesome <lang>Pali</lang> word bhūna-ha or °hu? This word the <lang>Pali</lang> <ab>comms.</ab> seem evidently to misunderstand. <ab>Cf.</ab> <ls>Renou, JA 1939</ls>, 〔p. 348 with n. 1〕, who connects the <lang>Pali</lang> word with <lang>Vedic</lang> and <lang>Skt.</lang> bhrūṇa-han; <ab>acc.</ab> to his note 1, the <lang>Skt.</lang> form is to be ‘restored’ in Dharmasamuccaya 〔16.8〕. <ls>Renou</ls> apparently did not know our <lang>BHS</lang> form, which seems only to complicate the question further. It is clear, in any case, that it is an uncomplimentary epithet. The <lang>Pali</lang> <ab>comms.</ab> interpret the <lang>Pali</lang> as {%destroying prosperity%} or {%welfare%}.
