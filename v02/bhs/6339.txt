{@cetaḥparyāya@}¦, <lex>m.</lex>, {%way of thought, manner of mind%}; less often citta-pa°; commonly preceded by para- or parasya, {%of others%}; knowledge of {%otherʼs mental make-up%} is one of the {@abhijñā@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>; so also in <lang>Pali</lang>, where Buddha is parassa (para-)ceto-(citta-)-pariyāya-kusala (-kovida), as one of the abhiññā. In <ls>Bhīk</ls> 〔27a.5〕 cetaḥparyāyasya is not preceded by para- or equivalent, but the meaning is certainly the same, since other abhijñā precede and follow it (divyasya śrotrasya, pūrvanivāsasya). In <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.321.13〕 Buddhas are called cetaḥparyāyasaṃpannāḥ, probably also with implication of para-, <ab>tho</ab> here most of the other abhijñā are not listed; but the next following epithet is ṛddhiprātihāryasaṃpannā(ḥ), which recalls one of them.
