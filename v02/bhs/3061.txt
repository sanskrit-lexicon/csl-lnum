{@āśvāsa-praśvāsa@}¦ (<lang>Pali</lang> assāsa-passāsa), <lex>m.</lex> dual or <ab>pl.</ab>, {%breath%}; usually used without clear indication of difference between the two terms, like {@ānāpāna@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>: <ls>LV</ls> 〔251.15—16〕 nāsikātaś cāśvāsapraśvāsāv uparuddhāv abhūtāṃ; 〔252.3〕 °sā ūrdhvaṃ śiraḥkapālam upanighnanti sma; as separate words, 〔259.7〕 āśvāsaviprahīnaḥ praśvāsavarjitu; <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.124.10 (and ff.)〕 mukhato nāsikāśrotrehi ca āśvāsapraśvāsā uparundhi (1 <ab>sg.</ab> <lex>aor.</lex>); <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.179.19〕 °sehi tathāgataṃ upahanati; <ls>Śāl</ls> 〔78.3, 17〕 kāyasyāśvāsapraśvāsakṛtyaṃ; <ls>Sādh</ls> 〔61.19〕 °sādikam; the verb {@uśvasati@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>, [Page110-b] corresponds to āśvāsa in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.208.3—4〕 āśvāsapraśvāsā uparuddhā … no pi uśvasati na praśvasati (the two verbs repeated twice in lines 8, 9), <ab>cf.</ab> <ls>LV</ls> 〔189.12〕 ucchvasantaṃ praśvasantam, rendered by <lang>Tib.</lang> <tib>dbugs dbyuṅ zhiṅ rṅub</tib> {%breathing out and in%}, but in line 15 below praśvasantaḥ is rendered <tib>dbugs dbyuṅ</tib>, {%breathing out%} (implying that ucchvasantaṃ was understood as {%breathing in%}); {@ucchvāsapraśvāso@} (<ab>sg.</ab>) also occurs, seemingly = āśvāsa-pra°, <ls>Śikṣ</ls> 〔42.5〕; in <ls>Sādh</ls> 〔146.17 ff.〕 it is entirely certain that praśvāsa is understood as {%outbreathing%} and āśvāsa {%inbreathing%}, tadanu tan mithunaṃ praśvāsavāyurathārūḍhaṃ nāsikāvivareṇa niḥsṛtya … sattvānāṃ kāyavākcittāni viśodhya gṛhītvā ca punar āśvāsavāyum āruhya tenaiva pathā svahṛtkamalakarṇikāyāṃ praviśet; consistent with this is <lang>AMg.</lang> ussāsa (and relatives), which <lang>BHS</lang> usage would clearly have associated with āśvāsa, and which <ab>acc.</ab> to <ls>Ratnach.</ls> means {%breathing in%}; <lang>Pali</lang> tradition is indeterminate, see <ls>Vism</ls> 〔i.272.1〕 which states that <ls>Vin. comm.</ls> defines assāsa as {%outgoing%}, passāsa as {%incoming%} breath, but that in Sutta <ab>comms.</ab> (Suttantaṭṭhakathāsu) the reverse is taught (the passage is misunderstood by <ls>PTSD</ls> and <ls>Pe Maung Tin</ls>; uppaṭipāṭiyā = <lang>Pkt.</lang> upparivāḍi, {%inverted, transposed%}). <lang>Tib.</lang> regularly āśvasati = <tib>dbugs brṅubs</tib> (or cognate) {%breathe in%} <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔1173, 1175〕, <ab>etc.</ab>, praśvasati = <tib>dbugs phyuṅ</tib> (or cognate) {%breathe out%} <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔1174, 1176〕, <ab>etc.</ab>; it therefore supports <ls>Sādh</ls> 〔146.17 ff.〕, and incidentally the equation of āśvāsa with āna and praśvāsa with apāna (see {@ānāpāna@}). How old this interpretation is remains uncertain, <ab>esp.</ab> in view of the fact that in <lang>Pali</lang> the <ab>comms.</ab> differed; Buddhaghosa himself, in the <ls>Vism.</ls> passage cited, declines to arbitrate between the two opposing views. Whatever may have been the meaning of the two terms, it seems clear that the <ab>cpd.</ab> (like {@ānāpāna@}) was commonly used in the sense of {%breath%}, collectively and as a whole.
