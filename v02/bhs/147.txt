{@agha@}¦, <lex>m.</lex> (= <lang>Pali</lang> <ab>id.</ab>), ({@1@}) {%sky, atmosphere%}; only in {@aghaniṣṭha@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>; ({@2@}) in the {@lokāntarikā@} (<ab>q.v.</ab>) passage, aghā aghasaṃvṛtā(ḥ) or aghasphuṭā(ḥ) (or other <ab>cpd.</ab>) means {%miseries (? miserable) and enclosed by%} ({%full of%}, or the like) {%miseries%}; so essentially <ls>Senart</ls>, <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i note 405 f.〕 We could perhaps recognize the first agha as an <lex>adj.</lex> (so in <ls>RV</ls> and once in <ls>BhāgP.</ls>); but it seems more likely that it is the more familiar noun, which <ab>esp.</ab> in <lang>Pali</lang> often means {%misery%}. In the <lang>Pali</lang> version (<ls>CPD</ls> <ab>s.v.</ab> ²agha, end) we should read aghā aghasaṃvutā, as <ls>Senart</ls> perceived (texts asaṃvutā, a very old corruption); or at least, that [Page005-b] must have been the original version. The <ls>CPD</ls> assumes an otherwise unknown <lex>adj.</lex> agha, {%aerial, without support%}, which is inappropriate and implausible.
