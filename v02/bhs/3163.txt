I find no basis for the theory. All the context shows is that persons dressed in these garbs should not be consecrated (dīkṣ). What the {%garb of Indra (? of a prince)%} means is not clear. It is true that śveta-paṭa is recorded as used of the Jain sect otherwise called śvetāmbara; doubtless this was the reason for Boehtlingkʼs conjecture, based on the assumption that this word equals digambara; but I doubt that this is sufficient to support it. That a real sort of cloth is meant is suggested by nānā-paṭeṣu, line 6.
