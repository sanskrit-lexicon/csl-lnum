{@jambu-kāñcana, jambū°@}¦, <ab>prob.</ab> to be read, with two <ab>mss.</ab> in first passage, for jāmbu° in <ls>LV</ls> 〔122.15〕 ekā kākini jāmbu-kāñcane bhavati upahatā, and 17 jāmbūkāñcanasaṃnibhā punar bhavet sakara iya mahī (both <ab>vss</ab>); the <ab>mg.</ab> seems evidently {%gold from the Jambu river%}, and it is hard to believe that ā in the first syllable is anything but a corruption (if an adjectival form, it should be jāmbava; the ā of jāmbunada, jāmbū°, is justified because that is derived from °nadī with suffix -a).
