{@puni@}¦, in <ls>LV</ls> 〔151.8〕 (<ab>vs</ab>) seemingly <ab>m.c.</ab> for *pune, certainly represents punar, {%but%}; both <ab>edd.</ab> read so, no <ab>v.l.</ab> No *pune seems to be recorded, even in a <lang>MIndic</lang> equivalent (as *puṇe, *uṇe). Possibly it may be assumed as <lex>loc.</lex> to the ‘stem’ puna- (<lang>Pkt.</lang> puṇa-, uṇa-) recorded by <ls>Pischel</ls> (see under {@punā@}). Less likely, in my opinion, *pune as ‘Māgadhism’ for <lang>MIndic</lang> puno.
