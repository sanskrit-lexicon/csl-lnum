{@Mātali@}¦, <ab>n.</ab> of a yakṣa: <ls>Māy</ls> 〔93〕; 〔237.4〕 In <lang>Pali</lang> Mātali, Indraʼs charioteer (as in <lang>Skt.</lang>), is assumed in <ls>DPPN</ls> to be identical with a yakkha who is to be called on in time of need. This yakkha, in any case, is presumably the same as our Mātali.
