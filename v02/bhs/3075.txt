{@āsarita@}¦, <lex>nt.</lex>, and {@niḥsarita@}, <lex>nt.</lex>; °taṃ <ls>Gv</ls> 〔351.18, 19〕 respectively: the first two of ten ‘bodily conditions’ (śarīrasthā dharmāḥ), the other 8 being cold, heat, hunger, thirst, delight, anger, birth-old-age-disease-and-death, and pain (pīḍā). Context throws no further light. Interpretation of these two terms obscure. Are they somehow related to āsario = saṃmukhāgataḥ <ls>Deśīn.</ls> 〔1.69〕, and ṇissariaṃ = srastam <ab>ibid.</ab> 〔4.40〕? Something like {%slack condition, slumped-down state%} might be intended by niḥsarita; would āsarita be its opposite, a state {%arrived%} at the right point?
