{@kṣaṇa@}¦, <lex>m.</lex> (= <lang>Pali</lang> khaṇa), {%birth under favorable conditions%}. There are 8 {@akṣaṇa@} (<ab>q.v.</ab>) but only 1 kṣaṇa, <ab>viz.</ab>, birth as a man in the ‘middle region’, where a Buddha is to be expected, at a time when he is born, and with the mental capacity to assimilate his doctrine (<lang>Pali</lang> <ls>AN</ls> 〔iv.227.8 ff.〕): <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.363.4〕 kṣaṇaṃ (<lex>acc.</lex>) ekaṃ buddhotpādaṃ suśobhanam; <ls>Suv</ls> 〔41.(13—)14(—15)〕 (bhavantu aṣṭākṣaṇavītivṛttāḥ, so read) āsādayantu kṣaṇarājam ({%the supreme favorable birth%}) uttamaṃ, (labhantu buddhehi samāgamaṃ sadā); <ls>Śikṣ</ls> 〔2.4〕; 〔114.15〕 kṣaṇasampad, {%the good luck of%} (this) {%favorable birth%}; 〔282.1〕 kṣaṇa-gati-pratilabdhena {%having obtained the lot of …%}; <ls>Kv</ls> 〔18.19〕 sarvakṣaṇopapannāḥ sattvā(ḥ), {%all creatures born under%} (the described) {%favorable conditions%}, <ab>cf.</ab> <ls>Sūtrāl.</ls> 〔xiii.10〕 kṣaṇopapatti.(In <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.378.1〕 <ls>Senart</ls> kṣaṇāṃś ca, but keep kṣaṇāc ca with <ab>mss.</ab>, {%and instantly%}.) Once, however, kṣaṇa in this sense seems to be [Page198-b] pluralized: <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.392.5—6〕 so akṣaṇāni parivarjayitvā, kṣaṇā ca tasya bhavanti viśiṣṭā (but <ab>mss.</ab> bhavati viśiṣṭo, taking kṣaṇā as <ab>n. sg.</ab>, 〔§ 8.24〕); the same <ab>vs</ab> <ls>Śikṣ</ls> 〔306.1〕 even makes 8 kṣaṇa, obviously as mechanical pendant to the 8 akṣaṇa; so akṣaṇaṃ vai vijahāti sarvaṃ, aṣṭakṣaṇāś cāsya viśiṣṭa bhonti. This is a secondary distortion. In <ls>LV</ls> 〔327.12〕 dullabho 'dya labhitaḥ kṣaṇavaro amṛto, {%today has been obtained the immortal%} (nectar-like?) {%excellent favorable birth that is hard to obtain%}, followed by 13 … varjitā (a)kṣaṇaduḥkhā asurasurapure, {%avoided the pains of unfavorable births in the cities of asuras and gods%}; evidently both kṣaṇa and akṣaṇa (the latter includes birth as a god!) are used in their standard meanings; but here the use of kṣaṇa is not strictly logical, since the Bodhisattva himself is speaking!
