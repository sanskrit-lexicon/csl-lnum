{@āgraha@}¦ (presumably <lex>m.</lex>; <ab>cf.</ab> {@āgṛhīta@}), {%niggardliness, holding back%} (from giving): <ls>SP</ls> 〔257.1〕 (after long description of how the Bodhisattva gave away everything, even his life) na ca me kadācid āgrahacittam utpannam, {%and I never conceived a thought of holding back%} (wrongly <ls>Burnouf</ls> and <ls>Kern</ls>); <ls>Av</ls> 〔i.174.5〕 (<ab>vs</ab>; after 4 nādattvā paribhuñjīran na syur matsariṇas tathā,) na caiṣām āgrahe cittam utpadyeta kadācana, {%and there would never arise for them a thought of holding back%} (from giving). As <ls>Speyer</ls> points out in his <ls>Index to Av, KSS</ls> 〔90.22〕 probably contains the word āgraheṇa {%with niggardliness, holding back from giving%}; but this <ab>mg.</ab> has not been recognized; the ordinary <lang>Skt.</lang> usage is not quite the same.
