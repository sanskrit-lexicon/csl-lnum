? {@niśāṭhaka@} or {@niśāthaka@}¦, in: kalaha-raṇa-°kā(ḥ) <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.176.6—7〕, <ab>ep.</ab> of Buddhas; clearly corrupt; <ls>Senart</ls> <ab>em.</ab> niśātakā, rendering {%(sharp =) redoubtable in%} (spiritual) {%fights and battles%}. But niśāta is not recorded in this use, and moreover I question such a complimentary <ab>fig.</ab> use of kalaha-raṇa. It seems more likely that some <ab>deriv.</ab> of niśāmyati, {%is pacified%}, is involved; a <lex>caus.</lex> to this would mean {%quieters%} (of strife and evil). Possibly niśāmakā(ḥ)?
