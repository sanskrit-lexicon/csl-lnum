{@nipaka@}¦, ({@1@}) <lex>m.</lex>, {%chief%} (<ab>cf.</ab> Jain <lang>Skt.</lang> nipa, doubtless semi-<lang>Skt.</lang> for <lang>AMg.</lang> ṇiva = <lang>Skt.</lang> nṛpa, <ls>Ind. Stud.</ls> 〔14.386〕): <ls>Divy</ls> 〔447.27〕; 〔451.20〕; ({@2@}) <lex>adj.</lex>, = <lang>Pali</lang> <ab>id.</ab>, in <lang>Pali</lang> tradition <ab>app.</ab> always interpreted as {%wise, prudent%}, and so nepakka, {%wisdom, prudence%}; occurs in <ls>Ud</ls> several times, mostly in <ab>vss</ab> which also occur in <lang>Pali</lang> with the same word, <ab>viz.</ab> 〔vi.8〕; 〔xii.18〕; 〔xiv.13, 14〕; 〔xv.6〕 (here text nṛpaka, not corrected in <ab>ed.</ab>; if genuine, could only be hyper-<ab>Sktism</ab>; the <lang>Pali</lang> <ab>vs</ab>, <ls>It.</ls> 〔47.3〕, has nipako); in all these occurrences {%zealous%} (see 3 below) would make quite as good sense; ({@3@}) in phrase nipakasyāṅgasaṃbhāraiḥ <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔7023〕 and <ls>Bbh</ls> 〔145.23〕, {%with the collection of parts of the nipaka%} (man)? <ab>Acc.</ab> to <lang>Tib.</lang> on <ls>Mvy</ls>, <tib>ḥgru skyaṅ</tib>, {%zealously attending (?), zealous%}, and so <lang>Chin.</lang> on <ls>Mvy</ls> appears to take nipaka; <ls>Wogiharaʼs Index to Bbh</ls> renders it by two <lang>Chin.</lang> characters which may mean {%constantly self-possessed%} (possibly associating the word with <lang>Pali</lang> niya, niyaka, = <lang>Skt.</lang> nija, {%own?%}). It would be possible to identify this occurrence of the word with <ab>mg.</ab> 2; it might mean {%prudent, wise%}, here; or contrariwise the occurrences under 2 might mean {%zealous%}. Further complication is caused by {@niyaka@}, which <lang>Tib.</lang> seems to interpret as the same as nipaka, suggesting graphic confusion; this is proposed in the <ls>Index to Mvy</ls> and in <ls>pw</ls> 〔7.352〕, where niyaka is assumed to stand for nipaka and the <ab>mg.</ab> {%wise%} is given for both <ls>Mvy</ls> passages, but doubtfully for the one here under discussion.
