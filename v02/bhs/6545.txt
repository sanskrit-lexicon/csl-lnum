{@jāgarya@}¦ (read °yā ? which is recorded in <lang>Skt.</lang> <ab>Gr.</ab> and <ab>Lex.</ab>, and <ab>prob.</ab> underlies <lang>Pali</lang> and <lang>AMg.</lang> jāgariyā), = <ab>prec.</ab>: jāgaryam anuyuktasya <ls>Ud</ls> 〔xv.8〕, {%of one devoted to%} (the discipline of) {%wakefulness%}. There is no metrical reason for shortening ā; °yām would be just as good. I suspect a misprint or error of tradition; <ab>prob.</ab> jāgaryām should be read.
