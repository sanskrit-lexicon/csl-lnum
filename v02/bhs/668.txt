So, by the knowledge of the Omniscient (sarvajñajñānena), because this knowledge is {%effortless%} (automatic, spontaneous: jñānānābhogatayā), a Bodhisattva gets in a single moment farther than he could get in 100,000 kalpas by his former effortful activity (pūrvakeṇa sābhogakarmaṇā). Again, in <ls>Sūtrālaṃkāra</ls> 〔ix.18—19〕, a Buddhaʼs activities proceed without ābhoga, {%effortlessly, spontaneously%}, like music from instruments that are not being played, or jewels that shine without labor.
