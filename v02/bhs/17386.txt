? {@styayāntataḥ@}¦, <ls>LV</ls> 〔3.22〕 (<ab>vs</ab>), uninterpretable; the preceding pāda is, yasyāpy avandhyāv iha darśanaśravā; then, after this word (the only <ab>v.l.</ab> is °takaḥ in <ed>Calc.</ed>; s- could possibly be the ending of -śravā, <ab>n. pl.</ab> for dual) śāntavimokṣapāragaḥ; <lang>Tib.</lang> faithfully renders all the rest but omits this completely. All the three other pādas of the <ab>vs</ab> begin with relative pronouns referring to the Bodhisattva; I have thought of reading here yo 'yaṃ tataḥ, which makes good sense but is remote from the <ab>mss.</ab>
