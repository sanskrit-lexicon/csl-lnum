{@muṣṭi@}¦, <lex>f.</lex> (used in <lang>Skt.</lang> of the {%handle%} or {%grasping-point%} of a weapon), ({@1@}) = {@muṣṭi-bandha@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>, {%grip%}, a manner of {%grasping%} (the bow): (bhagavatā, or maye, mayā, spoken by the Buddha) cirapraṇaṣṭā Śāk(i)yamuṣṭi jñātā <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.77.2, 3〕; 〔82.2〕, {%the long-lost%} (bow-){%grip of the Śākyas was known%}; referring to the young Bodhisattvaʼs exploit of wielding the bow of his grandfather Siṃhahanu, which no one else could wield; ({@2@}) see <ab>s.v.</ab> {@ācārya-muṣṭi@}; ({@3@}) since {@rikta-muṣṭi@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>, is used in lists of things empty and delusive, the word muṣṭi alone is, <ab>acc.</ab> to text <ls>Śikṣ</ls> 〔261.8〕, used in the same sense: evaṃ cakṣuś cendriyaṃ ca rikte (<ab>app.</ab> dual) muṣṭisadṛśam (but read rikta-muṣṭi-sadṛśam?) alīkam asadbhūtaṃ <ab>etc.</ab>; note that after rikte the epithets are (at least mostly; but see {@moṣadharma@}) singular, which makes the dual rikte suspicious, despite the double subject; and the standard use of {@riktamuṣṭi@}, occurring actually in the preceding line of <ls>Śikṣ</ls>, makes the <ab>em.</ab> seem called for.
