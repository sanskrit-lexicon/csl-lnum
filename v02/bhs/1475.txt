{@abhijānāti@}¦ (= <lang>Pali</lang> <ab>id.</ab>), ({@1@}) {%knows by%} {@abhijñā@}, <ab>q.v.</ab> The technical Buddhist meaning of the noun is certainly at times associated with the verb, which in <lang>Skt.</lang> means {%knows%} in a very general way. The extent to which the special Buddhist sense is present in the verb is often doubtful; I list a few cases where it seems pretty clear: abhijānāmi <ls>SP</ls> 〔200.8〕 (<ls>Burnouf</ls> and <ls>Kern</ls>, {%remember%}, I think wrongly); <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.57.7, 12〕; <ls>Gv</ls> 〔446.14〕; <ls>Vaj</ls> 〔34.20〕. The translation {%remember%}, also given <ls>CPD</ls>, is due to the fact that events of the past are often referred to; but I think the Buddha (the usual subject in such cases) {%knows%} them by {%supernatural knowledge%} or so-called {%intuition%} ({@abhijñā@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>), not by {%memory%}; ({@2@}) {%recognizes%} (as a duty), {%takes upon oneself%} (a vow or undertaking); so also in <lang>Pali</lang>, <ab>e.g.</ab> <ls>MN</ls> 〔i.80.5〕 (definitions in <lang>Pali</lang> dictionaries including <ls>CPD</ls> hardly do justice to this <ab>mg.</ab>): <ls>LV</ls> 〔254.2〕 abhijānāmy ahaṃ … ekam evādvitīyaṃ kolam āhāram āhartum, {%I undertake to allow myself to eat only a single kola as food%}; similarly <ls>LV</ls> 〔255.8, 15〕.
