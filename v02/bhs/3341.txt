{@utkrośayati@}¦ (<lex>denom.</lex> to <lang>AMg.</lang> ukkosa, see below), {%exalts, magnifies%}: <ls>AsP</ls> 〔419.4〕 ātmānam utkrośayati parān paṃsayati. The <lang>AMg.</lang> ukkosa is derived by <ls>Sheth</ls> and <ls>Ratnach.</ls> from utkarṣa (or utkṛṣṭa) and defined as <lex>adj.</lex>, {%highest, supreme%}, or, as <lex>n.</lex>, {%pride%}. If this is the true <ab>etym.</ab>, our word would be a hyper-<ab>Sktism</ab>, by false <ab>etym.</ab> Possibly, however, the <lang>AMg.</lang> word may really represent a <lang>Skt.</lang> *utkrośa, which, like <lang>Eng.</lang> {%a crying-up%}, could conceivably have meant {%glorification%}. To be sure I find no record, otherwise, of such a <ab>mg.</ab> in any <ab>deriv.</ab> of ut-kruś.
