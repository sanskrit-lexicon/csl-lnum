<hom>2</hom> {@cetayati@}¦ (the verb on which is based <lang>Pali</lang> <lex>caus.</lex> cetāpeti, below), {%buys%}: cetayitvā, <lex>ger.</lex>, <ls>Prāt</ls> 〔492.13〕; 〔493.2, 4, 9〕 <ab>etc.</ab>, see {@cetanaka@}. In <ls>Lang.</ls> 〔22.98〕 it was stated that the subject of <lang>Pali</lang> cetāpeti, {%causes to be bought, has bought%}, ‘is always a monk or nun, who instigates (a layman) to buy (something for himself or herself).’ This is true only in <ls>Vin.</ls> 〔iv.250.14—15〕; in <ls>Vin.</ls> 〔iii.216.13〕 and 〔237.10〕 the subject is a layman, <ab>tho</ab> the <ab>mg.</ab> is certainly {%causes to be bought, has bought%} (for the benefit of a monk). <ls>Vin.</ls> 〔iii.216.13〕 is the same passage as <ls>Prāt</ls> 〔492.13〕 (see {@cetanaka@}) where cetayitvā, {%having bought%}, replaces <lang>Pali</lang> cetāpetvā, {%having had%} (ordered) {%bought%} (for a monk). The non-<lex>caus.</lex> form of <ls>Prāt</ls> proves the meaning of the <lex>caus.</lex> <lang>Pali</lang> form, which <lang>Pali</lang> interpreters have not understood. The former is not recorded in <lang>Pali</lang>, nor the latter in <lang>BHS</lang>. The etymology is unknown but the <ab>mg.</ab> is clear from the contexts.
