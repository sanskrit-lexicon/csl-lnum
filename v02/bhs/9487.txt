{@-pāsa(ka)@}¦, <lex>f.</lex> {@-ikā@}, <ab>ifc.</ab> (<lang>Pali</lang> sūci-pāsa, <ls>Vism.</ls> 〔284.14〕), {%eye (of a needle)%}, in {@vaṭṭa-p°@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>, <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.87.17〕; text °yāsikā; same <ab>vs</ab> in <lang>Pali</lang>, <ls>Jāt.</ls> 〔iii.282.13〕, su-pāsiyaṃ (<ab>v.l.</ab> °kaṃ), <lex>acc.</lex> <ab>sg.</ab> with sūciṃ; <ab>comm.</ab> sundarena suviddhena pāsena samannāgatattā supāsiyaṃ (suggesting that -iya or -ka, -ikā, accompanies the <ab>Bhvr.</ab> <ab>cpd.</ab> only); and, in fact, pāse (<lex>loc.</lex>) occurs in the prose 〔iii.282.3, 5〕, with vijjhi(tvā), where the translators render wrongly {%dice%}; rather, {%piercing%} (the needle) {%at the%} (place for the) {%eye%}. From <lang>Skt.</lang> pāśa, {%loop?%} A <lang>Deśī</lang> word (<ls>Deśīn.</ls> 〔6.75〕) pāsa = akṣi, {%eye%}, is recorded. <lang>Hindi</lang> āṅkh, {%eye%}, is given the meaning {%hole of a needle%} (sūī kā ched) in <ls>Hindī Śabdasāgara (1914), 1</ls> 〔p. 312〕, <ab>s.v.</ab> āṅkh, <ab>mg.</ab> 4; I have found no confirmation of this, or of any use of a word for {%eye%}, of a {%needleʼs eye%}, in any Indian dialect, in any other source. The <lang>Hindi</lang> usage (evidently limited) could possibly be explained as due to English influence. <ls>Professor W.N. Brown</ls> informs me that the common <lang>Hindi</lang> word for {%eye of a needle%} is nākā. However, <ls>Jä.</ls> says that <lang>Tib.</lang> <tib>mig</tib>, regularly {%eye%}, also means {%eye of a needle%}, and {%hole for the handle%} of a hatchet <ab>etc.</ab>
