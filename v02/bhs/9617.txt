{@Purāṣa@}¦ (so <ab>ed.</ab> with <ab>mss.</ab>), <ab>n.</ab> of a former Buddha: <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.137.13〕. <ls>Senartʼs note</ls> rightly expresses doubt of the reading, which he says could at best represent <lang>Vedic</lang> Purāṣāḍ (once in <ls>RV</ls>). I suggest that Purāṇa is apt to be the true reading.
