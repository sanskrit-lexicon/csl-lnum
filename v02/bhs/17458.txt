{@sparśa-vihāra-tā@}¦ (once by error °vihāri-tā; <ab>etym.</ab>, see below), {%state of comfort, agreeable condition%}: <ls>SP</ls> 〔248.6〕; <ls>Bhīk</ls> 〔26a.3〕; in <ab>comp.</ab> with preceding sukha-, <ls>Kv</ls> 〔18.8〕 (here text erroneously °vihāri-tā); 〔89.13〕; oftener with sukhaṃ as separate and parallel near-synonym, <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.256.10〕; 〔323.20〕 (here sukha-tā); 〔324.5〕; <ls>Divy</ls> 〔156.14〕; <ls>Av</ls> 〔i.326.1〕; 〔ii.93.16〕. See {@asparśavihāra@}; and {@phāsu, phāsa, (a)phāṣa(ka)@}. The <lang>Pali</lang> equivalent is (a)phāsu(ka), often with vihāra; and <lang>AMg.</lang> has phāsuya (-vihāra). <ls>Pischel</ls> 〔208〕 derives from *sparśuka; <lang>Skt.</lang> sparśavant, <lang>BHS</lang> {@sparśanavant@}, {%pleasant to touch%}, suggest how the development of <ab>mg.</ab> might conceivably have taken place, but <ls>Pischel</ls>ʼs form is unrecorded. In <lang>BHS</lang> sparśa- is the regular form in this <ab>cpd.</ab>, but others occur, see above. It may be only a hyper-<ab>Sktism</ab>. The -u of the stem seems to be universally found in <lang>Pali</lang> and <lang>Pkt.</lang>, and occurs in <lang>BHS</lang>, but never followed by -ka, a fact which is not helpful to <ls>Pischel</ls>ʼs etymology. The Jain <lang>Skt.</lang> form is prāsuka, interpreted as {%free from living creatures%} (pra-asu; of a dwelling, vihāra, suitable for Jain monks); this looks like a fanciful hyper-<ab>Sktism</ab>. Various other etymologies have been suggested, see the <ls>Pali Dictt.</ls>; none are convincing. Note the use of phāsuṃ, phāṣaṃ as adverbs with viharati. The forms phāsa, phāṣa are recorded only in <lang>BHS</lang>.
