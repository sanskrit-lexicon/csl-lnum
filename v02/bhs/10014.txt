{@pratipadā@}¦ = <ab>prec.</ab> (as in <lang>Pali</lang> paṭipadā), but very much rarer; hence, where saṃdhi is ambiguous, I have assigned the doubtful forms to {@pratipad@}: dharmadeśanāpratipadā-saṃpannaṃ … śāstāraṃ <ls>Mv</ls> 〔iii.201.9〕, {%perfected in the practice of preaching the law%}; ye sarvatragāminīpratipadāṃ tatratatragāminīpratipadāṃ … prajānanti 〔320.14〕, in list of the ten {@bala@} of a Tathāgata, see pratipad, towards the end; nirvāṇagāminī °dā 〔201.15, 18〕; madhyamā °dā 〔331.8, 10〕, between the two extremes, introducing Four Noble Truths; in 12 the word mārga is omitted, text reading yad idam āryāṣṭāṅgikā, sayyathīdaṃ samyagdṛṣṭiḥ <ab>etc.</ab>; but one <ab>ms.</ab> reads āryāṣṭāṅgikaḥ, implying mārgaḥ as in all known parallels, and the adaptation to the <lex>fem.</lex> gender of pratipad in one <ab>ms.</ab> (followed by <ls>Senart</ls>) is <ab>prob.</ab> an error, resulting from the accidental omission of the noun mārgaḥ; below the usual formulas are found, duḥkhanirodhagāminī pratipad-āryasatyaṃ 〔331.18〕; tatra katamā (<ab>mss.</ab> °mo!) duḥkhanirodhagāminī pratipad āryasatyā (! so <ab>mss.</ab> and <ls>Senart</ls>), eṣaiva āryāṣṭāṅgo mārgo, <ab>etc.</ab>, 〔332.9—10〕.
