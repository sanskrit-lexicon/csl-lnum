{@durāvagāha@}¦, <lex>adj.</lex> (for durava°), {%hard to fathom%}: samudrakalpa … gambhīra-durāvagāhatvāt <ls>LV</ls> 〔424.11〕 (prose). See 〔§ 3.10〕. This is ignored by <ls>Weller</ls> 〔39〕, <ab>tho</ab> he refers to two other cases of apparent vowel-lengthening in the following lines (see <ab>l. c.</ab>). The -ā- here may have been carried over from some passage in <ab>vs</ab> where it was metrically required.
