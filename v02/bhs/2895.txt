{@Ārāḍa@}¦ (also {@Arāḍa@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>, and see next; = <lang>Pali</lang> Āḷāra), <ab>n.</ab> of a sage under whom Śākyamuni studied for a time; in a dvandva <ab>cpd.</ab> Ārāḍodraka (-Udraka) <ls>Divy</ls> 〔392.1〕 (see also under {@Arāḍa@} and {@Ārāḍaka@}); generally surnamed Kālāma (= <lang>Pali</lang> <ab>id.</ab>): °ḍa-Kāl° as one word <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔3515〕, but regularly two words: <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.118.1 ff.〕; 〔198.1〕; 〔iii.322.15, 17〕; in <ls>LV</ls> 〔238.14, 19 f.〕; 〔239.6, 12〕; 〔403.20〕; 〔404.2—3, 3—4〕, <ls>Lefmann</ls> reads the surname always Kālāpa; the <ab>mss.</ab> generally vary, in 〔404.3〕 all have Kālāma. However, there seems to have been some support in northern tradition for the ending -pa, for <lang>Tib.</lang> on <ls>Mvy</ls> and <ls>LV</ls> renders <tib>sgyu rtsal śes (byed)</tib>, {%knowing arts%}, which seems to point to analysis into kalā plus a form of root āp-.
