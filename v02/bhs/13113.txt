{@vaṃśa-ghaṭikā@}¦ (see {@ghaṭikā@}), {%bamboo-stick%}, as a kind of toy (rather than ‘game’, as Index and <ls>pw</ls> 〔Addendum〕): <ls>Divy</ls> 〔475.19〕. It may have been {%used%} in a game; <ab>cf.</ab> <lang>Pali</lang> vaṃsaṃ <ls>DN</ls> 〔i.6.13〕, <ab>comm.</ab> 〔i.84.26〕 = veṇuṃ ussāpetvā kīḷanaṃ; indeed, the true translation may be {%stick used in (the game of) vaṃśa%}, instead of the above.
