? {@krauṣita(-śabda)@}¦, (sound of) {%shrieking%}: <ls>Gv</ls> 〔522.16〕 (prose) °daṃ ca nārakāṇāṃ śṛṇyāt. Evidently a false hyper-<lang>Skt.</lang> form, based on some <lang>MIndic</lang> derivative of root kruś; no recorded form suggests itself as the precise source. Textual corruption, beyond the obvious ṣ for ś, is probably concerned.
