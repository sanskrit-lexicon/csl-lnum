{@gacchati@}¦, seems to be used in the sense of <lang>Skt.</lang> tiṣṭhati, vartate, {%exists, carries on%}, or substantially this, in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.22.11〕 (gharakehi) oruddhā chinna-īryāpathā (<ab>mss.</ab> oruddha chinna-ir°) gacchanti, (sinners in hell) {%shut up in huts, get along with their freedom of action cut off%}. So <ls>Senartʼs note</ls>. <ls>PTSD</ls> <ab>s.v.</ab> 5 gives a similar definition, but the passages it cites obviously do not support it. Here perhaps gacchanti <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.17.11, 12〕.
