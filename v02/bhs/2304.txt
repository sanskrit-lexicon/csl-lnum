{@a-vyābadhya@} or {@°vadhya@}¦, <lex>adj.</lex> and <lex>nt.</lex> <lex>subst.</lex> (see next, and <ab>cf.</ab> <lang>Pali</lang> avyāpajjha, as mentioned there), ({@1@}) <lex>adj.</lex>, {%that cannot be injured%} or {%disturbed, inviolable%}: <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.259.15〕 °dhyaṃ (<ab>ms.</ab>) … dharmaṃ deśayiṣyati; 〔279.9〕 °dhyaṃ arthaṃ prārthayamāno; in both of these spelled avyāvadhyaṃ, and associated with asādhāraṇaṃ; ({@2@}) apparently <lex>subst.</lex>, {%not doing harm%} (so <lang>Tib.</lang>, <tib>gnod pa mi byed</tib>): <ls>LV</ls> 〔380.17〕 avyābadhyaṃ (<ls>Foucaux</ls> {%<fr>la mansuétude</fr>%}) sukhaṃ loke. There is a <ab>v.l.</ab>, in <ab>mss.</ab> usually regarded as the best, adhyāvadhya; one might conjecture a-vyāvadhya, or °bādhya, <lex>ger.</lex>, {%not committing injury%}. But the context suggests that a <lex>nom.</lex> <ab>sg.</ab> noun is intended, sukhaṃ being apparently predicate (<ls>Foucaux</ls> {%<fr>douce</fr>%}): so <lang>Tib.</lang> takes it. In all of these forms the root vadh may have been felt to be concerned; or the short a of the root may be semi-<lang>MIndic</lang> (based on forms of bādh which are certainly commoner).
