[{@vīramaṇī@}¦ is cited <ls>PTSD</ls> <ab>s.v.</ab> veramaṇī as a <lang>BHS</lang> form for the latter, see {@vairamaṇa, °ṇya@}. But the only passage quoted is <ls>Jm</ls> 〔213(.7)〕, where the text reads vīramānī, which has nothing to do with <lang>Pali</lang> veramaṇī. If vīramaṇī exists in <lang>BHS</lang> I have failed to note it.]
