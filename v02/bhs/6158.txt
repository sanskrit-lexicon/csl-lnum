{@caryā@}¦ (<lang>Skt.</lang>) = {@cari@}, <ab>q.v.</ab>, used like that form (regularly in prose, but also in verses) <ab>esp.</ab> of the {%course of conduct%} of Bodhisattvas, which has four aspects or stages: catvārīmāni bodhisattvānāṃ bodhisattvacaryāṇi <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.1.2〕, listed in 3 as prakṛti-caryā, praṇidhāna-c°, {@anuloma-c°@}, anivartana-c° (<ab>cf.</ab> <ls>Senart</ls> 〔i p. xxi〕); same list, called catasraḥ … bodhisattvacaryāḥ 〔i.46.6〕; they are discussed in the following 〔46.8 ff.〕 (prakṛti-c° 〔46.8—47.11〕; praṇidhi-c° 〔47.12—63.10〕; anuloma- and avivarta-c°, very briefly, 〔63.11—14〕); they seem to be aspects, or possibly successive stages, of the Bodhisattvaʼs long course of development; prakṛti- refers to his original, basic endowment; praṇidhāna- (°dhi-) to his vows to attain enlightenment; anuloma- (also ānulomikī, see <ab>s.v.</ab> ānulomika) alludes to his progressive approach to the goal, and anivartana- (avivarta-) refers to the point at which it becomes impossible for him to backslide. We also find bodhicaryā(ṇi, with <lex>nt.</lex> ending, as above) <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.252.4〕, °ryāṃ 〔ii.341.1〕 (both of these <ab>vss</ab>), and duṣkara-caryāṃ 〔ii.241.4〕 (prose), parallel to bodhi-cari and duṣkara-cari.
