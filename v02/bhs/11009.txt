<hom>1</hom> {@bodha@}¦, <lex>m.</lex> (? = bodhi, normally <lex>f.</lex> in <lang>BHS</lang> as in <lang>Pali</lang>; but <lang>Pali</lang> records also bodha, <lex>m.</lex>, and <lang>Skt.</lang> bodha is used not very differently), ({@1@}) = {@bodhi@}, {%enlightenment%}, in the technical Buddhist sense; so far as noted, seems limited in <lang>BHS</lang> to the forms bodhāya and (rarely, <ab>prob.</ab> only in <ls>Mv</ls>) bodhāye, which are usually interpretable as datives: bodhāye <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.47.16〕; 〔60.11〕 (so <ab>mss.</ab> indicate); 〔ii.130.18〕 (in <ab>prec.</ab> line bodhāya, but <ab>v.l.</ab> °ye, in same phrase); <ls>Senart</ls>, whose note 〔i.369〕 on 〔i.3.2〕 discusses both the forms, calls bodhāye <lex>fem.</lex>, but such datives are recorded from indisputably <lex>m.</lex>-<lex>nt.</lex> stems, 〔§ 8.45〕; more tempting to the <lex>fem.</lex> interpretation is the occasional, <ab>tho</ab> rare, occurrence of bodhāya (in <ab>vss</ab>) where <lex>dat.</lex> syntax seems hard to accept; so <lex>gen.</lex>, to sarvi bodhāya (<ab>mss.</ab>) abhūṣi lābhinaḥ <ls>SP</ls> 〔49.14〕 (<ab>vs</ab>), repeated often in the sequel, as 〔50.2〕 <ab>etc.</ab>; in 〔50.12〕 and 〔51.4〕 bodhāya is confirmed by citations <ls>Śikṣ</ls> 〔92.13〕; 〔93.5〕; bodhāya … varṇam <ls>SP</ls> 〔10.6〕 (<ab>vs</ab>) = 〔12.16〕; <lex>loc.</lex>, bodhāya sthāpitāḥ <ls>SP</ls> 〔306.3〕 (<ab>vs</ab>); it is possible that the <lex>fem.</lex> gender of bodhi (in <lang>Pali</lang> and <lang>BHS</lang>) has led to some forms suggesting a stem bodhā (oblique °āya, °āye), but bodhāya is usually <lex>dat.</lex>, and occurs often in prose; <ls>KN</ls> <ab>ed.</ab> of <ls>SP</ls> often keeps it but as often emends to bodhīya, with utter inconsistency; <lex>dat.</lex> occurrences of bodhāya, <ls>SP</ls> (in <ab>mss.</ab>) 〔14.2〕; 〔33.1〕; 〔46.10〕; 〔47.13〕; 〔303.12〕; 〔334.11〕; <ls>LV</ls> 〔209.9〕 (prose); 〔284.8〕; <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.46.1〕; 〔63.2, 11〕; 〔97.2〕; 〔234.5〕; 〔ii.130.13, 17〕; <ls>Suv</ls> 〔42.6〕; <ls>Śikṣ</ls> 〔5.18〕; <ls>KP</ls> 〔20.9〕; <ls>Gv</ls> 〔105.15〕 (prose); <ls>Bbh</ls> 〔13.19〕 (prose), <ab>etc.</ab>; ({@2@}) <ab>n.</ab> of a householder: <ls>Divy</ls> 〔167.2 ff.〕; he lived in Śiśumāragiri; <ab>cf.</ab> <lang>Pali</lang> Bodhi (<ls>DPPN</ls>), a prince whose capital was Suṃsumāragiri; but the two stories seem quite unrelated otherwise.
