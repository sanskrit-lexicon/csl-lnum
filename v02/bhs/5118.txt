{@kṛtya@}¦, ({@1@}) <lex>m.</lex>, a kind of demon (<ab>cf.</ab> <lang>Skt.</lang> kṛtyā, of which this may be a <lex>masc.</lex> correspondent created for the nonce, in this passage which is a list of <lex>masc.</lex> evil spirits): <ls>SP</ls> 〔401.5—6〕 kṛtyo vā vetāḍo vā … (6) yakṣakṛtyo vāmanuṣyakṛtyo vā manuṣyakṛtyo vā; ({@2@}) <lex>nt.</lex>, or at end of <lex>adj.</lex> <ab>cpds.</ab>, {%business%} <ab>etc.</ab>, in some cases apparently transcending normal <lang>Skt.</lang> usage; bhakta-kṛtya (= <lang>Pali</lang> bhatta-kicca), <ab>lit.</ab> {%business of food%}, so {%a meal%}: <ls>Divy</ls> 〔185.22〕 °tyaṃ kartum ārabdhaḥ; āhāra-kṛtya, <ab>id.</ab>, <ls>Divy</ls> 〔82.26〕 nānenāhāreṇāhārakṛtyaṃ kariṣyati, {%he will not make his meal(s) on this food%}, <ab>i.e.</ab> live on this alone; <ls>Divy</ls> 〔236.6〕, text āhāraṃ (read °ra-?) kṛtyaṃ kuru, {%get your sustenance%}; <ab>acc.</ab> to <ls>Senart</ls>, note on <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.349.18〕 (〔p. 622〕), used like the <lang>Pkt.</lang> quasi-suffix -kera(ka) as substantial equivalent of <lex>gen.</lex> case-ending (<lang>Pkt.</lang> -kera is to be derived from <lang>Skt.</lang> kārya with <ls>Pischel</ls> 〔176〕; see {@-keraka@}); <ls>Senartʼs Index</ls> further interprets -kṛtye 〔ii.97.13〕 as ‘periphrasis for instrumental’, but this is certainly wrong, since there gītakṛtye pramattā jaladardarake ca clearly means {%careless in their occupation with singing and the%} (musical instrument) {%jaladardaraka%}; the cases where -kṛtya is alleged to be a ‘periphrasis for the <lex>gen.</lex>’ are also, in some cases, doubtful; in <ls>Mv</ls> 〔i.349.18〕 and 〔350.1〕 <ls>Senart</ls> rāja-kṛtyā kośāto, supposedly = {%from the kingʼs treasury%}, but the <ab>mss.</ab> read rāja-kṛto or (<ab>v.l.</ab> in 〔349.18〕) °kṛtāto, and the latter, at least, could be interpreted ({%the treasury made by the king%}); 〔ii.95.4〕 rājakṛtyato (<lex>abl.</lex>; <ab>v.l.</ab> °tāṃ) odhṛtabhāro, {%having laid down the burden of%} (<ab>lit.</ab> {%from, away from%}) {%royal duty%}; in 〔ii.446.14〕 rājakṛtye siṃhāsane rājeti kṛtva (°tvā?) upaviśāpito, {%he%} (who was actually not the king) {%was caused to sit upon the throne which was appropriate%} (really belonged) {%to the king%}; 〔ii.478.10〕 rājakṛtye (<ab>v.l.</ab> °kṛte) mahānase, and 12 rājakṛtyehi sūpehi, as in <ab>prec.</ab>; <ls>Senart</ls>ʼs interpretation may however be substantially correct in the last three, and in 〔ii.113.9〕 rājakṛtyaṃ udyānaṃ, {%the park that belonged to the king%}. Since <lang>Skt.</lang> kṛtya is in fact a synonym of kārya in some of its uses, the comparison with <lang>Pkt.</lang> -kera(ka), from <lang>Skt.</lang> kārya, is apposite. But the two alleged parallels from <ls>LV</ls> cited by <ls>Senart</ls> in his note, above, are not sound; one rests on a false reading of the Calcutta <ab>ed.</ab>, and the other is to be interpreted otherwise. ({@3@}) -kṛtya, -kṛtyaṃ, = {@-kṛtvā@} for <lang>Skt.</lang> -kṛtvas, <ab>q.v.</ab>
