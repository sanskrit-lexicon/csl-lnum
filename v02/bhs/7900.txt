{@dhātṛ@}¦ = {@dhātrī@}, {%nurse%}: mātṛbhir dhātṛbhiś (both <ab>edd.</ab>, no <ab>v.l.</ab>) ca rudantībhiḥ parivṛtāḥ <ls>SP</ls> 〔160.14〕 (prose), {%surrounded by their weeping mothers and nurses%}. The form has phonetic aspects (〔§ 3.95〕) but may and doubtless should be regarded as in part, and perhaps primarily, a riming adaptation to the preceding mātṛbhiḥ.
