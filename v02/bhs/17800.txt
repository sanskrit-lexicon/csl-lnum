? {@hrāsi@}¦ (for hrāse, <lex>loc.</lex> of hrāsa, {%diminution?%}), is obscure to me; occurs five times in a series of śloka <ab>vss</ab> (in many of which both meter and sense are bad, as the text is printed) in <ls>Mmk</ls>, evidently dealing with astronomical portents: tato hrāsi madhyāhne (submetrical! as 4th syllable from end, -i could be <ab>m.c.</ab> for -e) aparāhne divākare <ls>Mmk</ls> 〔276.6〕; tamo (read tato with all the rest ? or contrariwise, should they all be emended to tamo for tato ?) hrāsi-gate bhānoḥ kṣmākampo yadi jāyate <ab>ib.</ab> 〔11〕; tato hrāsi yāme vai (submetrical) calite vasumatī tadā (! hypermetric) 〔277.1〕; tato hrāsi yāmānte (submetrical) dṛśyate karma dāruṇam 〔3〕; tato hrāsi-madhye tu (submetrical) ante yāme prajāyate 〔17〕.
