[{@āśu@}¦: <ls>Johnston, notes on Saundarān.</ls> 〔vi.9〕 and <ls>Buddhac.</ls> 〔vi.64〕, assumes use as ‘expletive’, ‘to strengthen the force of the verb,’ ‘in <lang>epic</lang> and <lang>Buddhist Skt.</lang>,’ and suggests relation to the <lang>Pali</lang> particle assu. He so interprets āśu in <ls>Manu</ls> 〔4.171〕. I disagree on all this; it seems to me that there is no reason to assume any āśu except the <lex>adj.</lex> and adverb, {%quick(ly)%}. <lang>Tib.</lang> renders {%quickly%} at <ls>Buddhac.</ls> 〔vi.64〕.]
