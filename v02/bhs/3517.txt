{@Udāyin@}¦ (or Udayin? below), ({@1@}) = {@Kālodāyin@} (also appears as °dayin), <ab>q.v.</ab> (in <lang>Pali</lang> he is also called Udāyī): <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔1056〕, in text (also <ls>Mironov</ls>) printed Udayī, but Index Udāyin; <ls>Mv</ls> 〔ii.234.8〕; 〔iii.91.8〕; 〔93.3〕; <ls>LV</ls> 〔121.1〕 (son of the purohita Udayana); ({@2@}) one of the {@ṣaḍvārgika@} monks: <ls>Mvy</ls> 〔9476〕. (Tho not named in <lang>Pali</lang> as one of the Chabbaggiya monks, 2. Udāyī in <ls>DPPN</ls> seems to have had a character deserving this reproach and is doubtless the same person as ours.) Named <ls>Divy</ls> 〔543.24〕 as type of a monk who might commit a sin; subjected to {@parivāsa@} and succeeding penances, <ls>MSV</ls> 〔iii.32.14 ff.〕 (in <ls>Divy</ls> and <ls>MSV</ls> not identified with the ṣaḍvārgika); ({@3@}) <ab>n.</ab> of a son of Ajātaśatru and ancestor of Aśoka (= <lang>Pali</lang> Udāyibhadda): <ls>Divy</ls> 〔369.10〕; in the same line called, <ab>acc.</ab> to text, {@Udayibhadra@}; <ls>MSV</ls> 〔ii.42.11 ff.〕
