4. {%Kāñcī%}¦ (No. I, L. 19):
The earliest epigraphic mention of Kāñcī is to be found in this
[Page-255+ 39]
inscription. The inscription refers to Viṣṇugopa of Kāñcī as
one of the kings of Dakṣiṇāpatha defeated by Samudragupta
but reinstated in their kingdoms. Kāñcī is the same as Kāñcīpura
or modern Conjeevaram in the Chingleput district of Madras
Presidency.<sup>554</sup> The kingdom of Kāñcī extended from the mouth
of the Krishna to the south of the river Palar and sometimes
even to the Kaveri.<sup>555</sup> It is also known as Kāñcīpeḍu.<sup>556</sup> It is
mentioned in several early records relating to the ancient his-
tory of the Pallavas of Kāñcī (of about A.D. 250 to 355)<sup>557</sup> The
Aihole inscription of Pulakeśin, the Cālukya ruler in the 7th
century A.D. refers to his conquest of Kāñcīpura.<sup>558</sup> The ear-
liest literary reference to Kāñcī is in the Mahābhāṣya of Patañ-
jali.<sup>559</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Mahābhāṣya on Vārttika 26 to Pāṇini IV. 2. 104 men-
tions Kāñcīpuraka (i. e. a resident of Kāñcīpura).<sup>560</sup> Hiuen
Tsang informs us that Kāñcī was 30 li or 5 miles in circuit, and
that in the city there were eighty Deva temples and many here-
ties called Nirgranthas.<sup>561</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Purāṇas attach great importance to Kāñcī.<sup>562</sup> It is
included in a list of seven holy cities of India.<sup>563</sup> The Brah-
māṇḍa Purāṇa<sup>564</sup> associates Kāñcī with Kāśī, the two forming
the two eyes of Śiva. It is stated in the Bārhaspatya sūtra<sup>565</sup>
that Kāñcī is a Śākta-kṣetra. In the Devībhāgavata<sup>566</sup>, Kāñcī
is said to be a sthāna of the Devī called Annapūrṇā.<sup>567</sup> The
Vāmana Purāṇa<sup>568</sup> mentions it as the best among the cities.
The Skandapurāṇa<sup>569</sup> counts it amongst the holy places. The
Bhāgavatapurāṇa<sup>570</sup> and the Yoginītantra<sup>571</sup> also mention it.
In Daśakumāracaritam<sup>572</sup> it is referred to as a city of the Drāviḍa
country.
<div n="P"/>Kāñcī is full of temples and shrines. Śiva Kāñcī and Viṣṇu
Kāñcī form the western and eastern parts of the city, while
the Jaina Kāñcī is known as Tiruparutti-Kunram.<sup>573</sup> Of the
temples at Conjeevaram, the most famous are the Kāmākṣī
temple with a Cakra placed in front of the deity, the Vaikuṇṭha
Perumal temple of Viṣṇu and the Śhiva temple of Kailā-
śanātha.<sup>574</sup>
<div n="P"/>Apart from its religious significance Kāñcī has been a
famous centre of learning. The Pallava ruler Mahendravarman,
the author of the Mattavilāsa-Prahasana; Bhāravi, the author
[Page-256+ 39]
of the Kirātārjunīyam and Daṇḍin, the author of the Daśakumār-
acaritam are said to have flourished here.<sup>575</sup>
<div n="P"/>The famous Buddhist dialectician Dinnāga came here to
satisfy his intellectual and spiritual thirst and about the middle
of the fourth century A.D., the brāhmaṇa Mayūraśaraman,
who founded the Kadamba line came here for getting recogni-
tion in Vedic learning.<sup>576</sup> The Ādi-guru Śaṅkarācārya establi-
shed here the famous Pīṭha known as Kāmakotipīṭha.<sup>577</sup>
Literally Kāñcī means a ‘girdle’. It seems to have been so
named because it is situated like a girdle round the sea.
