5. {%Kubera%}¦ (No. 1, L. 20):
Ruler of Devarāṣṭra mentioned in the list of the kings of
Dakṣiṇāpatha who were defeated by Samudragupta. According
to Bhandarkar Kubera was perhaps the father of Kubera-nāgā
of the Nāga family, who was a queen of Candragupta II.<sup>52</sup> In
this case the name of Kubera, the god of wealth, has been
given directly which is against the rules prescribed by the
Gṛhya-sūtras.<sup>53</sup>
