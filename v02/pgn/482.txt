3. {%Sumeru%}¦ (No. 17, L. 13, No. 32, L. 15):
In No. 17 the mountain Sumeru is described as one of the
breasts of the earth (the other being Kailāśa) and the Gupta
[Page-299+ 39]
king Kumāragupta is mentioned as the lord of the earth. In
No. 32 it has been named as Amarabhūdhara. Its other names
are Meru, Karṇikācala, Ratnasānu, Svargiri, Svargigiri and
Kāñcanagiri.<sup>92</sup>
<div n="P"/>Sumeru is identified with Rudra Himālaya in Garhwal,
where the river Gaṅgā has its source, it is near Badarikāśrama.<sup>93</sup>
According to the Matsya Purāṇa<sup>94</sup> the Sumeru Parvata is
bounded on the north by Uttara-Kuru, on the South by
Bhāratavarṣa, on the west by Ketumāla and on the east by
Bhadrāśvavarṣa.<sup>95</sup> It is also mentioned in the Padmapurāṇa.<sup>96</sup>
and the Kālikāpurāṇa.<sup>97</sup> According to the Kālikāpurāṇa Śiva saw
the summit of it. We also learn from this text that the Jambu
river flows from this mountain.<sup>98</sup> We also find the mention of
the Meru in the Śiśupālavadha of Māgha. It was on account
of the eminence of Sumeru among the mountains that for
praising kings they were described as ‘Meru’ among kings.<sup>99</sup>
This metaphor may have been applied after the contention of
the Purāṇas that the earth is supposed to be like lotus, with
four Mahādvīpas as its four petals and mount Meru as its
pericarp.<sup>100</sup>
