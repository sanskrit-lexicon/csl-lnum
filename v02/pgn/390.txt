 {%Grāma:%}¦
<div n="P"/>It means an inhabited place, village, hamlet.<sup>383</sup> It seems
that firstly the word grāma denoted the collective inhabi-
tants of a place, community or race. Later on this sense was
transferred to an inhabitation and was used in the sense of a
village. The earlier usage of this word, which occurs frequently
from the Ṛgveda<sup>384</sup> onwards, appears to have been in the sense
of a village. The early Āryans must have dwelt in villages which
were scattered over the country, some close together, some far
apart, and were connected by roads.<sup>385</sup> In the early Vedic
literature village is regularly contrasted with the forest (āraṇya)
in the evening the cattle regularly returned thither from the
forest.<sup>386</sup> The villages were probably open, though perhaps a
fort(pur) might on occasion be built inside.<sup>387</sup> Presumably they
consisted of detached houses with enclosures, but no details
are to be found in Vedic literature. Large villages (mahā-
grāmāḥ) were known.<sup>388</sup> The grāma may, however, perhaps
be regarded more correctly as an aggregate of several fami-
lies, not necessarily forming a clan, but only part of a clan
(viś), as is often the case at the present day.<sup>389</sup> The head of the
village was called Grāmaṇi or ‘the leader of the village’. The
king's share in a village is referred to as early as the
Atharvaveda.<sup>390</sup>
<div n="P"/>Villages played an important role as a unit of Rāṣṭra or
city.<sup>391</sup> Kheṭa was the half of a city and the village was the
[Page-240+ 39]
half of a kheṭa.<sup>392</sup> Cities other than the capital are called
Karvaṭa, a little less is Nigama and lesser is grāma and still
lesser is a house.<sup>393</sup>
<div n="P"/>Grāma is changed into gaon,<sup>394</sup> as Suvarṇagrāma, Sonār-
gaon; Kalahagrāma, Kahalgaon.
<div n="P"/>Following are the place-name with this suffix. We have also
included here some place-names which are villages though they
have not been termed as such with this suffix.
