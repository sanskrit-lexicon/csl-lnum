1. {%Acyuta%}¦ (No. 1, L. 13):
It is the same as Acyutanandin mentioned in line 21.<sup>46</sup> It is
the abbreviated form of the full name Acyutanandin where
the latter part is dropped. The abridged form ‘Acyuta’ leads to
the violation of the injunctions of the Dharma-sūtras which
forbid giving direct names of gods to human-beings. Acyuta is
the name of god Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa.<sup>47</sup>
