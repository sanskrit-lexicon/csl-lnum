5. {%Kāśī%}¦ (No. 28, L. 6):
It is mentioned in Inscription No. 28. According to the in-
scription a vihāra at Vaṭa-gohālī was inhabited by the disciples
of the Nigrantha preceptor (Śramaṇācārya) Guhanandin,
belonging to the Pañca-stūpa section (nikāya) of Kāśī.<sup>578</sup>
Evidently Vaṭagohālī was a seat of Jain monks who had their
major seat at Kāśī.
<div n="P"/>The name Kāśī is derived from the root Kaś ‘to shine’.
The Skandapurāṇa<sup>579</sup> says that the city of Kāśī became famous
by that name because it sheds light on (the way to) nirvāṇa or
because, that indescribable refulgence, viz. god Śiva shines
forth here.<sup>580</sup> B.C. Law connects it with Ti-miao meaning ‘read
sprouts’, a Chinese translation of the word and this links it
with a certain kind of grass.<sup>581</sup> It has been known for centuries
under five different names, viz., Vārāṇasī (modern Banaras),
Kāśī, Avimukta, Ānandakānana and Śmaśāna or Mahāśma-
śāna.<sup>582</sup>
<div n="P"/>The earliest mention of the Kāśīs as a tribal people occurs
in the Paippalāda recension of the Atharvaveda.<sup>583</sup> Vārāṇasī
was the capital of the people of Kāśī.<sup>584</sup> Thus it seems that
geographically Kāśī represented a larger area than Vārāṇasī, the
latter being the capital of the former. But in medieval times
the position became just the reverse. Vārāṇasī comprehended
the entire district and Kāśī generally represented only a small
place. In a grant of Mahārāja Vināyakapāla we get a reference
to a village of Tikkarikā situated in the Pratiṣṭhāna-bhukti,
and attached to Kāśī-pāra-Pathaka which belonged to Vārāṇasī
viṣaya.<sup>585</sup> Kāśī pāra-pathaka represented the site of the ancient
city of the Kāśī.<sup>586</sup> The Vividhatīrthakalpa<sup>587</sup> also mentions
[Page-257+ 39]
Kāśī as a janapada in the Vārāṇasī City.
<div n="P"/>The ancient kingdom of Kāśī was bounded by Kośala on the
north, Magadha on the east, and Vatsa on the west. The
Cedis and Karuṣas lived to their south.<sup>588</sup> At the time of
Buddha, the kingdom of Kāśī was absorbed by the kingdom of
Kośala.<sup>589</sup>
<div n="P"/>We know that Lord Buddha gave his first discourse near
Kāśī in the Deer Park at Sārnāth. Kāśī was an important
Buddhist centre and was a seat of monastic establishments in
the time of Aśoka.<sup>590</sup> During the period of Gupta rule it was
on its way to become a strong centre of Śiva worship with the
mahāliṅgas set up in different parts of the city.<sup>591</sup> The Purāṇas
include the region in the Gupta empire.<sup>592</sup>
<div n="P"/>It was a great centre of trade and commerce. Patañjali in
his Mahābhāṣya<sup>593</sup> mentions Kāśī cloth. The Buddhist litera-
ture gives us many accounts of the merchants of the city.<sup>594</sup>
<div n="P"/>Kāśī has been a place of much importance for Hindu pil-
grimage. Its religious importance has been discussed at length
in the Kāśīkhaṇḍa of the Skanda Purāṇa. Lord Śiva never
leaves it, hence it is known as Avimukta. A man who dies here
is believed to get emancipation.<sup>595</sup>
