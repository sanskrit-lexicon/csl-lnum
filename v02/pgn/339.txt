 {%Rāṣṭra<sup>1</sup>%}¦ (from §rāj):
<div n="P"/>It is the oldest and biggest territorial term. In the Ṛgveda<sup>2</sup>
and later Saṃhitās,<sup>3</sup> it denotes ‘kingdom’ or ‘royal territory’.
It is considered to be one of the Prakṛtis (constituents)<sup>4</sup> and
refers to a country.<sup>5</sup> It was the name of a Commissioner's
division under the Rāṣṭrakūṭas.<sup>6</sup> In South India, under the
Pallavas, Kadambas, and Sālaṅkāyanas also it denotes only
a district, if not a tehsil.<sup>7</sup> The Samarāṅgaṇasūtradhāra<sup>8</sup> says
that ‘all the rāṣṭra including {%nagara%} is called {%deśa%} or {%maṇḍala%}
while nagara is excluded in janapada’.
<div n="P"/>It divides rāṣṭras into three kinds: —
<div n="P"/>(i) Big: It consists of nine thousand and ninety villages,
but some scholars say that the nine thousand and sixty
four villages make a big rāṣṭra.<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>(ii) Middle: It consists of five thousand, three hundred and
eighty four villages.<sup>10</sup>
<div n="P"/>(iii) Small: It consists of one thousand, five hundred and
forty eight villages.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>It further discusses that seven cities should be established
in each rāṣṭra.<sup>12</sup>
<div n="P"/>In place-names rāṣṭra is changed into:<sup>13</sup>
<div n="P"/>(a) Rāṭhā, as Mahārāṣṭra, Marāṭhā
<div n="P"/>(b) Rāṭ, at Mayarāṣṭra, (= Mayarāṭ), Mirāṭ
<div n="P"/>It also changes into raṭṭa,
<div n="P"/>Cf. Nāgiraṭṭa. Walde also derives it
from §rāj-(n. sg. rāṭ)

<div n="P"/>In ancient Indian history extending over several centuries,
we do not find uniformity in the nomenclature of the different
territorial and administrative divisions in the various kingdoms
flourishing in different centuries and provinces. In the small
kingdoms like those of the Pallavas, the Vākāṭakas and
Gāhaḍavālas we usually find reference to only one territorial
division, the district variously called {%viṣaya%} or {%rāṣṭra.<sup>15</sup>%}
<div n="P"/>Following are the names with this ending:
