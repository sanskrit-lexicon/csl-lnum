5. {%Matṛviṣṇu:%}¦ (No. 18, L. 7):
He was the installer of the stone pillar at Eraṇ, a mahārāja,
grandson of mahārāja Indraviṣṇu. We also find his name in
the Eraṇ Stone Boar Inscription of the time of Toramāṇa
(A.D. 500-515).<sup>20</sup> Mātṛ stands for one of the seven Mātṛ-
kās<sup>21</sup> and may refer to the prevalence of the Mātṛ cult. The
name is formed by the similar process of the combination of
the names of two deities, Mātṛ and Viṣṇu. Mātṛ if taken as a
short form for the Vedic Mātariśvan, together with Viṣṇu
would mean Agni and Viṣṇu an interpretation that is relevant
to the context.
