Sanskrit word. As Woolner has pointed out words with cereb-

Another possibility is that these names show dialectal elements.
Even now-a-days we give names like Maṇṭu, Baṇṭu, etc., to
little children. There is also a possibility that the Sanskrit
word ‘mantra’ meaning ‘a hymn or magical formula’ got
changed to ‘maṇṭa’ through a process of Prakritization, or
we may derive it from an artificial root ‘maṇṭ’ to act as
intermediator.<sup>36</sup>
