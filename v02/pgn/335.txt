22. {%Vāhlika%}¦ (No. 20, L. 2):
The Meharaulī Pillar Inscription (No. 20) describes the {%dig-%}
{%vijaya%} of a king named Candra (i. e. Candragupta II) in the
first verse as stated below: “He, on whose arm fame was
inscribed by the sword, when, in battle in the Vaṅga count-
ries, he kneaded (and turned) back with (his) breast the enemi-
es who, uniting together, came against him; — he, by whom,
having crossed in warfare the seven mouths of the (river)
Sindhu, the Vāhlikas were conquered; — he, by the breezes of
whose prowess the Southern ocean is even still perfumed”.<sup>526</sup>
<div n="P"/>We find various readings of the name Vāhlika in literature
which are: Vāhlika, Bāhlika, Vāhlīka and Bāhlīka. In our
inscription (No. 20) {%‘Vāhlikāḥ’,%} i. e. Vāhlika in plural denotes
the people of Vāhlika i. e. Bactria (modern Balkh) region on
the Oxus in the northern part of Afghanistan.<sup>527</sup>
<div n="P"/>Mislead by a verse in the Rāmāyaṇa,<sup>528</sup> D.R. Bhandarkar<sup>529</sup>
places Vāhlikas in the close proximity of the Vipāśā, the
modern Beas. The reading {%Vāhlīkān%} in the passage quoted
from the Rāmāyaṇa is a mistake for {%Vāhīkān.%} Numerous
passages can be quoted from the Epic, Puranic and classical
Sanskrit literature to prove that the Punjab = Pañcanada, ‘the
land of five rivers’, was in ancient times called the Vāhīka
country.<sup>530</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%‘Vāhīka’%} was, in fact, a general term for the whole of
Punjab. We know Śākala as {%Vāhīka-grāma%} from Patañjali and
also {%Pātanaprastha%} which is modern Pathankot by the same
term. Moreover, Vatsyāyana in his Kāmasūtra and Rajaśekhara
in his Kāvya-mīmāṃsā mention the people of Bāhlīka and
Punjab as two separate entities. <sup>531</sup>
<div n="P"/>There is, however, one verse in the Karṇaparvan of the
Mahābhārata which suggests that Vāhīka was originally the
name of a country or people on the Vipāśā, (the Beas): “In
the Vipāśā, there were two Piśācas named {%Vahi%} and {%Hika;%}
their descendants are called Vāhīkas who are not the creation
of Prajāpati”.<sup>532</sup>
[Page-168+ 39]
<div n="P"/>Later on the sense of the word expanded to cover all the
tribes living in the Punjab. It is interesting to note that the
Māhābhārata sometimes uses the terms Vāhīka, Madra, Jartika,
Āraṭṭa and Pañcanada synonymously. It appears that the lands
of these tribes which lived close to one another became in
course of time moulded into a big kingdom under the powerful
kings of Śākala (Sialkot). As Vāhīka was beyond Kurukshetra
and, therefore, outside the boundary of Brahmāvarta, its ana-
logical connection with the word {%‘bahis’%} may have been another
cause of the expansion of its geographical sense.<sup>533</sup> This is
also reflected in the Vārttikas of Katyāyana who derives the
word ‘Vāhīka’ from {%‘vahis’%} or {%‘bahis’,%} meaning ‘outside’ (the
pale of Āryandom).<sup>534</sup>
<div n="P"/>Some scholars<sup>535</sup> rely on the description of the Bāhlikas
as the offspring of two Piśācas, {%Bahi%} and {%Hika,%} as given in
the Mahābhārata. Buddha Prakash holds that fresh stream
of the Bactrian people which swooped over the Punjab came
to be known as Bālhikas; their name which became a general
designation for the people of Punjab was later corrupted as
Vāhīka.<sup>536</sup> But we have already shown that the two were
separate entities.
<div n="P"/>We know that the Vāhīkas were the people living within
the boundaries of the five rivers including the sixth Sindhu
(Indus),<sup>537</sup> but according to the Meharaulī Pillar Inscription
Candragupta conquered Vāhlikas after crossing the seven
months of the (river) Indus (sapta mukhāni sindhoḥ).<sup>538</sup> So
Vāhlika of our inscription is certainly Balkh in the extreme
north of Afghanistan.<sup>539</sup> Bajpai<sup>540</sup> opposes it on the ground
that Candragupta could not have gone to so far off a place as
Bactria which is situated across the Hindukush and rejects
the older contention of scholars that the Kuṣāṇas were ruling
in Bactria during king Candra's campaign and that he crossed
the Hindukush to crush them.
<div n="P"/>But the view of Bajpai is not tenable since it is clear from
the lines in our inscription<sup>541</sup> that king Candra had conquered
the Vāhlikas after crossing the seven mouths of the river
Indus.
<div n="P"/>So far as the literary evidence is concerned we find that
Bālhika is the name of a people in the Atharvaveda;<sup>542</sup> here
[Page-169+ 39]
the fever (Takman) is called upon to go to the {%Mūjavants,%} the
{%Mahāvṛṣas,%} and the {%Balhikas.%} The Mūjavants are quite certainly
a northern tribe, and though the passage may contain a pun
on Bālhika as suggesting ‘outsider’ (from {%bahis,%} ‘without’),<sup>543</sup>
still there is no doubt that the name was chosen from a northern
tribe.<sup>544</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇā<sup>545</sup> mentions a Kuru king named
Balhika Prātipīya. It seems that Balhika was a descendant of
Pratīpa. But there is no evidence to show why he bore the name
Balhika.<sup>546</sup> He is perhaps the same as Mahārāja Bāhlika Prātī-
peya of the Mahābhārata.<sup>547</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Rāmāyaṇa shows that the Royal Kuru family originally
migrated from the Bāhlīka country. The passage in question<sup>548</sup>
says that Ila, son of the Prajāpati Kardama, who was the king
of the Vāhli country, gave up Bahlika in favour of his son
Śaśavindu, and founded a new city Pratiṣṭhānapura in the
Madhya-deśa, where his other son Pururava Aila continued to
rule. This links up the Ailas, the progenitor of the Kurus, with
the Kardama royal family of Bāhli. H.C. Raychaudhuri<sup>549</sup>
suggests that Kārddama, the name of the ruling family of
Vāhlika, was obtained from the river of that name in Persia,
and thus infers that the home of the Kārddama king is to
be identified with Bahlika or Balkh in Iran. This view was
earlier advocated by Roth<sup>550</sup> and Weber.<sup>551</sup> But Zimmer<sup>552</sup>
rightly shows that there is no need to assume any Iranian
influence.<sup>553</sup>
<div n="P"/>We know Vāhlīka from the Puranic list of peoples<sup>554</sup> The
Account of fifty-six countries<sup>555</sup> is interesting as it mentions
them with the Hūṇas, Kauravas, Gāndhāras and Vidarbhas
among others. In the Śaktisaṅgama Tantra<sup>556</sup> Bāhlīka is
described as famous for horses and situated to the east of
Mahāmlechha and beginning with Kamboja. B.C. Law on the
basis of reference in the Mahābhārata<sup>557</sup> places the Vāhlikas
in the neighbourhood of Gandhar and Kamboja.<sup>558</sup>
<div n="P"/>Katyāyana (4th century B.C.)<sup>559</sup> mentions Bāhlāyana and
derives it from the word Bāhli, a country also mentioned in
the Arthaśāstra of Kauṭilya.<sup>560</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Vāyu Purāṇa, Śiva Purāṇā, Kāvya-Mīmāṃsā of Rājaśe-
khara and the Rāmāyaṇa<sup>561</sup> place the Vāhlika country in the
[Page-170+ 39]
northern division.<sup>562</sup> Bāhlika is the name of a person in the
Viṣṇu-Purāṇa.<sup>563</sup> The Nāṭyaśāstra<sup>564</sup> of Bharata says that
Bāhlikabhāṣā was spoken by the northern people (Udīcyas).
A similar reference is also to be found in the Sāhitya-darpaṇa.<sup>565</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Kāmasūtra of Vatsyāyana,<sup>566</sup> Bāhlīka is grouped
with Strīrājya, which occurs in the list of North-Western divi-
sion. The peculiar custom in Bāhlika of several young men
being married to a single woman as in {%strīrājya (strīrājye ca%}
{%Bāhlike...%}), appears to be an outlandish custom prevailing
in the regions to the west of India.<sup>567</sup> The Jayamaṅgalā comm-
entary also says that Bāhlīka was in Uttarāpatha.<sup>568</sup>
<div n="P"/>We find the word Vāhlika occurring in the Amara-kośa in
two ways:
