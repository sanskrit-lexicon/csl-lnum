10. {%Sudarśana%}¦ (No. 14, L. 15: L. 17):
It is the name of a lake situated at some distance from
Girinagara as mentioned in the Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription of
Rudradāman I (A.D. 150).<sup>64</sup> The lake was originally cons-
tructed by the Vaiśya Puṣyagupta, the provincial governor of
the Maurya king Candragupta. Later on during the reign of
Aśoka it was adorned with conduits, by the Yavana governor
Tuṣāspha.<sup>65</sup> The same lake was destroyed by the excessive
floods in the Suvarṇasikatā, Palāśinī and other streams arising
from the mountain Ūrjayat.<sup>66</sup> By a breach, four hundred and
twenty cubits long, just as much broad, (and) seventy-five
cubits deep, all the water flowed out, so that, the lake, almost
like a sandy desert became extremely ugly to look at.<sup>67</sup> The
lake was immediately beautified with repairs by king Rudradā-
man.<sup>68</sup>
<div n="P"/>Inscription No. 14 informs us that during the reign of
Gupta king Skandagupta in the year 136 (G. E.), due to heavy
continuous rains the Sudarśana lake burst out on all sides<sup>69</sup>
and had the appearance of a sea. Eventually, contrary to the
literal meaning of its name the Sudarśana became ugly to look
at.<sup>70</sup> The lake was repaired in the year 137 (G. E.)<sup>71</sup> (= A.D.
456) by Cakrapālita, who was appointed governor of Giri-
nagara by his father Parṇadatta, who was Skandagupta's
viceroy in Surāṣṭra.<sup>72</sup>
