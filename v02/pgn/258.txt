7. {%Sthāya (na) pāla%}¦ (No. 33, L. 8):
A merchant who also acts as a scribe. D.C. Sircar takes the
reading ‘Sthāyapāla’.<sup>99</sup> He also suggests the possibility of a
second reading {%‘sthānapāla’%} which means ‘watchman or police-
man’.<sup>100</sup> This reading seems to be correct; Sthāyapāla
yields no sensible meaning.
