10. {%Palakka%}¦ (No. I, L. 20):
It has been mentioned as one of the kingdoms of Southern
[Page-260+ 39]
India whose kings were first conquered and then released by
Samudragupta. Its ruler was Ugrasena. Palakka has been
identified with Palakkaḍa, the capital of a Pallava viceroyalty
and was situated in the Nellore district.<sup>632</sup> Law is inclined to
identify Palakkaḍa with Palakalūru in the Guntur taluka.<sup>633</sup>
Allan and G. Ramdas locate it in the Nellore district.<sup>634</sup> Smith
places Palakka in the Nellore district.<sup>635</sup> Dubreuil, however,
identifies Palakka with a capital of the same name which was
situated to the South of the Krishna and which is mentioned
in many Pallava Copper Plates.<sup>636</sup> The kingdom of Palakka
might have extended westwards beyond the region now occu-
pied by the districts of Auddepal and North Arcot.<sup>637</sup> It was
perhaps situated to the west of Kāñcī on the Eastern Ghāṭs.<sup>638</sup>
