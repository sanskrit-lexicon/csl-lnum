6. {%Govindagupta:%}¦ (No. 42, L. 2; No. 32, L. 3):
In No. 42, he is mentioned as the son of Candragupta II. His
mother's name was Dhruvasvāminī. No. 32 explains the basis
of his name: “The lord of the earth, i.e. king Candragupta,
produced a son whose exalted name was Govindagupta, who
was as famous as Govinda (Viṣṇu) for the glory of his virtues,
and who resembled the sons of Diti and Aditi, i.e. the demons
and gods.”<sup>77</sup> The poet means that Govindagupta resembled
demons in physical strength and valour, and gods in spiritual
virtues.
<div n="P"/>Govindagupta probably ruled as emperor between (his
father) Candragupta II and (his younger brother) Kumāra-
gupta 1. His reign could not have been more than three years,
the interval between the last known date of Candragupta II
(G. E. 93) and the earliest known date of Kumāragupta I (G.E.
96).<sup>78</sup> P. L. Gupta assigns his short regnal period between
A.D. 412 and 415.<sup>79</sup> That Govindagupta could have ruled as
emperor only for a very short period is also evident from the
fact that he has left no coins. Being a collateral, Govindagupta
does not appear in the genealogical table in the inscriptions of
Kumāragupta and his successors.<sup>80</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is also likely that Kumāragupta defeated or ousted
Govindagupta and seized the throne; and after his accession,
avoided all references to his elder brother.<sup>81</sup>
