2. {%Ārjunāyanas%}¦ (No. 1, L. 22):
One of the tribes subjugated by Samudragupta.
<div n="P"/>The name Ārjuneya is mentioned in the Ṛgveda as the
patronymic of Kautsa.<sup>56</sup> The tribe, associated with the name
of Arjuna, existed in the Punjab and the North-West up to
the advent of Gupta power in the fourth century A.D.<sup>57</sup> The
word Arjuna in the Vedic literature<sup>58</sup> denotes ‘white’ and
‘white lepresy’ and is also an epithet of Indra. But it does not
denote a tribe or a human hero.
<div n="P"/>The word Arjuna has an unmistakable resemblance with
the Śaka word erzuna, meaning a ‘leader’ or ‘chief’ which is
derived from arzi. Analogous to it are the Śaka words {%aljsā,%}
meaning ‘silvery’ and {%āljsata,%} meaning ‘silver’, that are akin to
the Avestan word {%erezata%} (silver), the Sanskrit word {%rajata%}
(silver) and the Persian word {%arziz%} (tin).<sup>59</sup> All these words have
the original sense of whiteness and brightness, that are also
connoted by the word arjuna in Sanskrit. It is highly significant
that Arjuna, the hero of the Mahābhārata, is said to have borne
this name, because he was ‘white’ and ‘pure’ in action.<sup>60</sup> All
over the Eurasian steppes the nobles were regarded as ‘white’
and the commoners were considered ‘black’. Hence the word
for white colour was employed to denote the idea of leadership.
This is why {%erzuna%} was used in the sense of a ‘leader’ in Śaka
languages.<sup>61</sup>
<div n="P"/>Vedic and Śaka both branched from the same parent Indo-
European language. Hence many words were common to both.
But whereas arjuna in Vedic lost its pristine sense and was
only used as an adjective, signifying ‘whiteness’, in Śaka it
meant a ‘tribe’ and a human hero and later on this sense was
imparted to this word in India as a result of the impact of the
Śakas.<sup>62</sup>
<div n="P"/>The tribe, bearing the name of Arjuna, was also connected
with some people of Chinese Turkestan, whose heroes, and
kings had this designation.<sup>63</sup> In the Uighur redaction of the
[Page-128+ 39]
Hiḍimbāvadha<sup>64</sup> the name of Arjuna occurs in the form of
Arcuni.<sup>65</sup> According to Sylvain Levi, this episode of the Mahā-
bhārata owed the privilege of entering into the Turkish world
to the presence of the name of Arjuna in it, who was regarded
as the eponymous founder of the dynasties of some Central
Asiatic oases-states.<sup>66</sup>
<div n="P"/>Pāṇini<sup>67</sup> refers to the worshipper of Arjuna, called Arjunaka,
together with the devotee of Vasudeva, called Vāsudevaka.
This remark implies that Arjuna was treated as a deity at the
time of Pāṇini and his followers occupied a prominent posi-
tion. <sup>68</sup> The Kāśikā replaces Auddālakāyana of Patañjali by
Ārjunāyana,<sup>69</sup> the name of a tribe nearer to its own time in
discussing the meaning of Prācya-bhārata (II. 4. 66).
<div n="P"/>From the accounts relating to the invasion of India by
Alexander we learn that a tribe named {%Agalassoi%} (Arjunāyana)
fought with Alexander.<sup>70</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Bṛhat-saṃhitā<sup>71</sup> places the Ārjunāyana in the northern
division of India and describes them as being in the region of
Bṛhaspati.<sup>72</sup>
<div n="P"/>Ptolemy refers to a people in the Punjab whom he calls
{%Pandoouoi%}<sup>73</sup> = Pāṇḍavas with whom the Ārjunāyanas may be
connected.<sup>74</sup> Ārjunāyana coins are found in the Mathurā
region and ‘they may be assigned with probability to the region
lying west of Agra and Mathura, equivalent, roughly speaking,
to the Bharatpur and Alwar States’.<sup>75</sup>
