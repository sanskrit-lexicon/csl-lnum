He is introduced as {%Mahārājādhirāja%} in all references except
the Mathurā Pillar Inscription of Candragupta II, G.E. 61<sup>57</sup>
where he is mentioned as {%Bhaṭṭārakamahārāja rājādhirāja.%} He
was the daughter's son of the Licchavis, and son of {%Mahārājā-%}
[Page-022+ 39]
{%dhirāja%} Śrī Candragupta I born on the queen Kumāradevī.<sup>58</sup>
He has been mentioned as a {%‘Paramabhāgavata’%} (a devout
devotee of Lord Viṣṇu).<sup>59</sup> No. 2, L. 10 gives the justification
of his name Samudragupta.<sup>60</sup> Mookerji says that the name
Samudragupta was probably a title assumed after his conquests.
It means ‘protected by the sea’ and may refer to his dominion
which extended upto the sea. The Mathurā Inscription of
Candragupta II actually describes the fame of his conquests as
extending up to the four oceans ({%caturudadhisalilāsvāditaya-%}
{%śasaḥ%}). The name Samudragupta may be split up into two parts,
Samudra being his personal name, and Gupta being his
surname. This is supported by the fact that the obverse of his
coins of standard type sometimes bears the legend ‘Samudra’
while the reverse has {%‘Parākramaḥ’%} as his title. The name
‘Samudra’ also appears on some other types of his coins, such
as the Archer type and Battle-Axe type.<sup>61</sup> Mookerji<sup>62</sup> holds that
Samudragupta's personal name was Kāca and that Samudra-
gupta was his title. But the identification of Kāca with
Samudragupta has been rightly opposed by scholars.<sup>63</sup> Vāmana
in his Kāvyalaṃkāra<sup>64</sup> refers to Candraprakāśa as the son of
Candragupta which Goyal takes to be another name of
Samudragupta.<sup>65</sup> But it seems to be the name of a local king of
Ayodhyā rather than that of a member of the Imperial Gupta
dynasty.<sup>66</sup> Another probable and most suitable explanation
of the name ‘Samudragupta’ may be ‘protected by Lord Śiva’,
Samudra being an epithet of Śiva.<sup>67</sup>
<div n="P"/>Samudragupta is given many epithets in No. 1. Some of
these are also supported by numismatic evidence.<sup>68</sup>
