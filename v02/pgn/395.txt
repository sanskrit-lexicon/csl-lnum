(5) {%Doṅgā-grāma%}¦ (No. 34, L. 11; No. 36. L. 6):
In No. 34 we get a reference to ‘Doṅgā’, but in No. 36, the
name appears as Doṅgā-grāma.
[Page-241+ 39]
<div n="P"/>The Doṅgā-grāma is said to have been situated in Himavac-
Chikhara<sup>403</sup> identified with Barāhachatra (Varāhakṣetra) in
Nepal.<sup>404</sup> But scholars<sup>405</sup> are not right in co-relating Doṅgā-
grāma with Himavac-Chikhara, Inscription No. 36 clarifies it.
There is a long gap between the references to Himavac-
Chikhara and Doṅgā-grāma. Actually Himavac-Chikhara is
associated with Kokāmukhasvāmin (a form of the Boar incar-
nation of Viṣṇu) and Śvetavarāhasvāmin where originally (ādya)
these gods were installed in a temple. The name Doṅgā-grāma
is used for the place where the lands were donated by Ṛbhupāla
for the construction of the two temples having the names of the
two deities.<sup>406</sup> The word ‘ādya’ in L. 7 is significant and dis-
tinguishes the temples at Himavac-Chikhara from those at
Doṅgā-grāma. The writer had to use the word ‘Himavac-
Chikhara’ again in L. 10, with the names of Kokāmukhasvāmin
and Śvetavarāhasvāmin in order to avoid confusion between
the temples at the two places. For the temple at Doṅgā-grāma
the writer uses the word ‘iha’ in L. 11. We also find the word
‘Himavac-Chikhara’ absent in another Dāmodarpur Copper
Plate Inscription of the Gupta Year 224 (= A.D. 543), where
a person named Amṛtadeva hailing from Ayodhyā donates a
land for the repairs and worship, etc., at the temple of Lord
Śvetavarāhasvāmin obviously because he was referring to the
temple at Doṅgā-grāma and there was now, no question of any
confusion or distinction.<sup>407</sup> Thus Doṅgāgrāma does not seem
to have any connection with Himavac-Chikhara. This village
is to be located somewhere near Dāmodarpur and belonged to
the Koṭivarṣa viṣaya as mentioned in the records.<sup>408</sup> But the
village was most probably situated in a hilly area which is clear
from the word Doṅgā itself.<sup>409</sup> The word ‘Atrāraṇye’ (local
forest where the temple of Śvetavarāhasvāmin was situated) in
No. 37 also attests to it.<sup>410</sup> The village may have consisted of a
few huts with bushes and trees all around or the place where
the temples were situated was away from habitation.
<div n="P"/>Thus the earlier suggestion that the Koṭivarṣa district
included the hilly region bordering on the northern fringe of
Bengal,<sup>411</sup> which was rejected by Sircar,<sup>412</sup> seems to be
correct.
