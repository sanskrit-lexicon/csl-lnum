1. {%Avamukta%}¦ (No. 1, L. 19):
<div n="P"/>The Inscription No. 1 refers to Avamukta as one of the
countries in Dakṣiṇāpatha subdued by Samudragupta. Its ruler
was Nīlarāja.<sup>529</sup>. Avamukta has not been identified with cer-
tainty. Some scholars on the basis of the similarity of names
identify it with Avimukta another name of Kāśī.<sup>530</sup> But the
suggestion cannot be accepted. Avamukta of the inscription
was a country in the South while Avimukta or Kāśī is an eas-
tern country. It may be considered to be situated in the Goda-
vari district.<sup>531</sup> According to D.B. Diskalkar it must lay on
the Eastern Ghāṭs which lie to the west of Kāñcī or Conjee-
varam.<sup>532</sup>
