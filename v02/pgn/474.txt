7. {%Palāśinī<sup>40</sup>%}¦ (No. 14, L. 16):
This river Palāśinī issues from the mountain Raivataka. On
account of the flood it had swollen. The poet, in describing
the scene says that the river had gone to join the sea. Palāśinī
is described as emanating from the mountain Ūrjayat (i. e. the
same as Raivataka).<sup>41</sup> We find another Palāśinī, (mod. Parās),
a tributary of the Koel in Choṭānagpur.<sup>42</sup> It seems that the
river was decorated with numerous Palāśa (flower) trees that
grew on its banks. The flowers falling in the river must have
given it the name of Palāśinī.<sup>43</sup>
