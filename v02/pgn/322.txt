9. {%Kurus%}¦ (No. 22, L. 7):
The Kurus were divided into two branches, the Northern and
the Southern.<sup>171</sup> We have here a reference to the Uttarakurus.<sup>172</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Kurus were one of the most ancient and prominent of
the Indo-Āryan kṣatriya tribes.<sup>173</sup> In the earliest literature the
Kurus do not appear under that name as a people. But
[Page-137+ 39]
mention is made of a prince, Kuruśravaṇa (Glory of the
Kurus)<sup>174</sup> and of a Pākasthāman Kauravyāyaṇa.<sup>175</sup> The Athar-
vaveda<sup>176</sup> refers to Parīkṣita as a king of the Kurus and his
son, Janamejaya, is mentioned in the Śātapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>177</sup>
as one of the great performers of the horse sacrifice.
<div n="P"/>Oldenberg<sup>178</sup> seems to be right in suggesting that the
Kuru people, as known later, included some of the tribes
referred to by other names in the Ṛgveda. Kuruśravaṇa,
shown by his name to be connected with the Kurus, is in the
Ṛgveda called Trāsadasyava, ‘descendant of Trasadasyu,’
who is well known as a king of the Purus. Moreover, it is
likely that the Tṛtsu-Bharatas, who appear in the Ṛgveda as
enemies of the Purus, later coalesced with them to form the
Kuru people.<sup>179</sup> Moreover, there is evidence that the Bharatas
occupied the territory in which the Kurus were later found.
Two of them are spoken of in a hymn of the Ṛgveda<sup>180</sup> as
having kindled fire on the Dṛṣadvatī, the Āpayā, and the
Sarasvatī — that is to say, in the sacred places of the later
Kurukshetra.<sup>181</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Brāhmaṇa literature, the Kurus are often con-
nected with Pāñcālas.<sup>182</sup>
<div n="P"/>The territory of the Kuru-Pāñcālas is declared in the
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa to be the middle country (Madhyadeśa).<sup>183</sup>
A group of the Kuru people still remained further north — the
Uttara Kurus beyond the Himalayas.<sup>184</sup> It appears from a
passage of the Śātapatha Brāhmaṇa that the speech of the
Northerners-that is, presumably the Northern Kurus-and of the
Kuru — Pāñcālas was similar, and regarded as specially pure.<sup>185</sup>
There seems little doubt that the Brahmanical Culture was
developed in the country of the Kuru-Pāñcālas, and that it
spread thence east, south and west. <sup>186</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Uttara Kurus, who play a mythical part in the Epic
and later literature, are still a historical people in the Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa.<sup>187</sup> where they are located beyond the Himalayas
(pareṇa Himavantam). In another passage,<sup>188</sup> however, the
country of the Uttara Kurus is stated by Vasiṣṭha Sāthavya
to be a land of the gods ({%deva-kṣetra%}), but Jānṃtapi
Atyarāti was anxious to conquer it, so that it is still not wholly
mythical. It is reasonable to accept Zimmer's view that the
[Page-138+ 39]
northern Kurus were settled in Kashmir, especially as Kuruk-
shetra is the region where tribes advancing from Kashmir
might naturally be found.<sup>189</sup> In Buddhist literature, Uttara-
Kuru is very often mentioned as a mythic region, but there are
some passages which go to show that there was a faint memory
of a country that once had a historical existence.<sup>190</sup>
<div n="P"/>Some time before the fourth century B.C., the monarchical
constitution of the Kurus gave place to a republic, for we are
told by Kauṭilya<sup>191</sup> that the Kurus were {%‘rāja-śabdopajīvinaḥ’,%}
or ‘enjoying the status of rājan’ — i. e. all citizens had equal rank
and rights.<sup>192</sup>
<div n="P"/>Shafer<sup>193</sup> shows that only the upper castes of the Kauravas
were Āryan, the bulk of the population were probably non-
Āryan as is clear from the fact that whereas the Kauravas
rallied the support mostly of the non-Āryans, the Pāṇḍavas
had the support of Āryans and concludes that the Northern
Kurus were Muṇḍic.<sup>194</sup>
