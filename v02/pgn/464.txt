1. {%Āryāvartta%}¦ (No. 1, L. 12):
Samudragupta is stated to have violently exterminated many
kings of Āryāvarta such as Rudradeva, Matila, Nāgadatta,
Candravarman, Gaṇapatināga, Nāgasena, Acyuta, Nandin
and Balavarman.<sup>677</sup> We also find references to Āryāvarta in
other epigraphic records.<sup>678</sup>
<div n="P"/>Literally Āryāvarta<sup>679</sup> means ‘the abode of the Āryas, or
excellent or noble people’. The word ‘Ārya’ here is significant.
<div n="P"/>It has been interpreted in two ways: some scholars derive
the word Ārya from the root §{%Ar,%} to plough, and suggest that
the Vedic Āryans were so called because they despised the
pursuits of agriculture and remained shepherds and hunters.<sup>680</sup>
<div n="P"/>“If {%Ārya%} were purely a racial term. a more probable deri-
vation would be {%Ar,%} meaning strength or valour, from §ar
to fight, whence we have the name of the Greek war-god Ares,
areios, brave or warlike, perhaps even arete, virtue signifying,
like the Latin virtues, first physical strength and courage and
then moral force and elevation”.<sup>681</sup> “Intrinsically, in its most
fundamental sense, Ārya means an effort or an uprising or
overcoming. The Āryan is he who strives and overcomes all
outside him and within him that stands opposed to the human
advance.”<sup>682</sup> Wilson says that a variety of ancient designations
of which ‘Āria’ is a component element (cf. Ariāna) are con-
nected with the term Ārya. The Zend name for the country
to the west of the Indus was ‘Eriene-veejo’, that is the Sans-
krit Āryāvarta.<sup>683</sup>
<div n="P"/>In defining the boundaries of Āryāvarta, Vasiṣṭha and
Baudhāyana in their Dharmasūtras lay stress on the word
Ārya and explain it to mean {%śiṣṭa.%} Patañjali also in his Mahā-
[Page-264+ 39]
bhāṣya first explains the meaning of {%śiṣṭa%} in order to draw
attention to the cultural basis of the name Āryāvarta. He
remarks that correct conduct is found in Āryāvarta and then
mentions its boundaries.<sup>684</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Brāhmaṇa period the centre of Āryan culture and ci-
vilization shifted to the Gangetic Doab “Āryāvarta came to be
treated as conterminous with the region between the Gaṅgā
and Yamunā.<sup>685</sup> In the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka<sup>686</sup> special honour
is assigned to those who dwell between the Gaṅgā and the
Yamunā. In the Śutra period Āryāvarta extended from the
hills of Central Rajasthan to the hills of Central Bihar.<sup>687</sup>
<div n="P"/>At the time of Patañjali,<sup>688</sup> Āryāvarta was bounded on the
north by the Himalayas, on the south by Pāriyātraka, on the
west by Ādarśāvalī and on the east by Kālakavana (Rajmahal
hills) ‘Black Forest’ or rather Kanakhala, near Hardwar.<sup>689</sup>
<div n="P"/>Thus it seems that Āryāvarta bore a sacerdotal sense and
denoted a particularly limited area where Āryan institutions
were the basis of social order.<sup>690</sup>
<div n="P"/>What was originally called Āryāvarta was later named as
Madhya-deśa and Āryāvarta came to include the whole of
Northern India. This is related to the gradual spread of Ārya-
nism.<sup>691</sup> Brahmāvarta and Brahmarṣideśa lost their identity in
the Madhya-deśa and combined with Prācya, Pratīcya and
Udīcya (Uttarāpatha) became the equivalent of Āryāvarta.<sup>692</sup>
Both Udīcya and Prācya were taken as the home (loka) of
standard Sanskrit both in Pāṇini's time and earlier. In the time
of Patañjali, Āryāvarta came to be regarded as the home of the
Śiṣṭas (persons proficient in the Śāstras) whose language set the
norm.<sup>693</sup>
<div n="P"/>By the second century A.D., the last limit of the composi-
tion of the Manu-smṛti, the wider outlook of Āryāvarta was
popular. It was the name of the tract extending from the
Eastern to the Western Ocean, and bounded on the north and
south by the Himalaya and Vindhya respectively.<sup>694</sup> This is
supported by the Kāvyamīmāṃsā of Rājaśekhara.<sup>695</sup> Rājaśek-
hara speaks of the river Narmadā as the dividing line between
Āryāvarta and the Dakṣiṇāpatha.<sup>696</sup> In Inscription No. 1, L. 29
Āryāvarta is contrasted with Dakṣiṇāpatha, ‘the southern
region’.<sup>697</sup> The wider sense of Āryāvarta is also supported by
[Page-265+ 39]
references in the Abhidhāna-cintāmaṇi<sup>698</sup> and the Rājataraṅ-
giṇī.<sup>699</sup>
