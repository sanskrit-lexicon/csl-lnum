We get a reference to the Vāṭā-nadī in an inscription at Kalai-
kuri, Sultānpur near Naogaon, Rajshahi district, East Pakistan
now Bangla Desh. It was flowing to the east of a village
named Dhānyapāṭalikā.

lying about 10 miles to the north-east of its junction with the
Atrai.<sup>73</sup> It flows west to east through the southern part of the
Rajshahi district<sup>74</sup>
