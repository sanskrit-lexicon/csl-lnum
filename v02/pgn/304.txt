7. {%Sagara%}¦ (No. 36, L. 12; No. 37, L. 21):
He is mentioned in these inscriptions as a donor of lands.<sup>72</sup>
Literally Sagara means ‘containing poison or poisonous’
It is the name of a king of the solar race, sovereign of Ayodhyā,
son of Bāhu. He is said to have been called Sa-gara, as born
together with a poison administered to his mother by the co-
wives of her husband. He was father of Asamañjasa by Keśinī
and of sixty thousand sons by Sumati; the latter were turned
into a heap of ashes by the sage Kapila, and their funeral
ceremonies could only be performed by the waters of Gaṅgā
to be brought from heaven for the purpose of purifying their
remains; this was finally accomplished by Bhagīratha.<sup>73</sup>
