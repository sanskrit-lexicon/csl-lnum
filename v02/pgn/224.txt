6. {%Somaviṣṇu%}¦ (No. 43, L. 8):
Soma is also a deity, personified as one of the most important
Vedic gods, but in post-Vedic mythology and even in a few
(late) hymns of the Ṛgveda and sometimes also in later-Vedic
period Soma is identified with the Moon (as the receptacle
of the other beverage of gods called {%Amṛta,%} or as the lord of
the plants) and with the god of the Moon as well as with
Viṣṇu, Śiva, Yama and Kubera.<sup>55</sup> This name has also been
formed by the combination of the names of two deities.
