11. {%Madrakas%}¦ (No. I, L. 22):
One of the tribes subjugated by Samudragupta. We also know
of Madra as a personal name in No. 15, L. 8.
<div n="P"/>Madras claimed descent from an eponymous king Madraka,
son of Śibi Auśīnara, and were septs of the family of Śivi
like the Kaikeyas.<sup>231</sup>
<div n="P"/>According to Dr. Buddha Prakash ‘Bhadra’ was another
Variant of Madra.<sup>232</sup> But this view is not acceptable to us.
The Mahābhārata<sup>233</sup> mentions the Bhadras, but only in the
Bombay recension; the Calcutta recension has Madra.<sup>234</sup> We
know that Bhadra and Madra had independent existence, as
found in the legend of Bhadrā Kākṣīvatī, bride of Vyuṣi-
tāśva.<sup>235</sup> The queen had seven children, three Śālvas and
four Madras. <sup>236</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Candravṛtti on Candra<sup>237</sup> informs us that Udumbara,
Tilakhala, Madrakāra, Yugandhara, Bhuliṅga and Śaradaṇḍa,
are the divisions of Sālva (or Śālva). The word Śālva literally
[Page-144+ 39]
means an animal like stag or gazelle which bespeaks of
Scythian origin.<sup>238</sup> Buddha Prakash connects it with the
modern sub-caste Saluja (Skt. Sālvaja). Anyhow, we know that
Madras were a branch of Śālvas who were sons of Bhadra.
J. Przyluski<sup>239</sup> considers the Madras to have been a section of
the Bhadras on the ground that the former had among their
ancestress a queen named Bhadrā. Both the Bhadras and the
Madrakas are mentioned separately in the Bṛhatsaṃhitā,<sup>240</sup> the
Bhadras with the Śālvas in the Madhyadeśa (Middle land)
and the Madrakas with the Mālavas in the northern quarter.
<div n="P"/>Nakula and Sahadeva were the sons of Pāṇḍu by his
wife Mādrī. The name of their mother Mādrī suggests their
connection with the clan of the Madras.<sup>241</sup> Since Bālhiki
(Bāhlika stands for the Bactrians) was the title of Mādrī,
Madras were of Irano-Bactrian origin; the Madras may rep-
resent the Iranian tribe, Māda or Mede.<sup>242</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Madras were an ancient kṣatriya tribe.<sup>243</sup> We do not
find their mention in the early Vedic Saṃhitās but the Vaṃśa
Brāhmaṇa (of the Sāmaveda) tells us of a Vedic teacher named
Madra-gāra Śauṅgāyani (‘descendant of Śuṅga’) whose pupil
was Kāmboja Aupamanyava.<sup>244</sup> Zimmer<sup>245</sup> concludes, with pro-
bability, that these names point to a connexion of the Kambojas
and the Madras. We know from the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>246</sup>
that the Madra country was the chief centre of Vedic learning.
We know of a Kāpya Patañcala amongst the Madras who
was a famous teacher of Vedic lore.<sup>247</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Uttara Madras, the ‘northern Madras’ are referred
to in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>248</sup> as living beyond the Himalaya
({%pareṇa himavantam%}) in the neighbourhood of the Uttara
Kurus, probably, as Zimmer<sup>249</sup> conjectures, in the land of
Kashmira. The Madras mentioned in the Upaniṣads were, like
the Kurus, probably settled somewhere in Kurukshetra in the
Madhyadeśa or ‘Middle Land’.<sup>250</sup>
<div n="P"/>Pāṇini<sup>251</sup> mentions two divisions of the Madras, Pūrva
(eastern) and Apara (Western). In the Bṛhatsaṃhitā they are
mentioned twice; firstly as Madra situated in West in Vāyavya
Koṇa,<sup>252</sup> and secondly as Madraka with Mālava in the
North.<sup>253</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Rāmāyaṇa, we read that Sugrīva sent monkeys to
[Page-145+ 39]
the Madrakas and other tribes in quest of Sītā.<sup>254</sup> The Madra
tribe or kingdom<sup>255</sup> is mentioned in the Bhīṣmaparvan of the
Mahābhārata (chap. IX) and in Pāṇini's grammar (II, 3, 73;
IV, 4, 67). The Madras held the Central portions of the
Punjab;<sup>256</sup> they appear in the Epic period to have occupied
the district of Sialkot, between the rivers Chenab and Ravi,<sup>257</sup>
or according to some between the Jhelum and the Ravi.<sup>258</sup>
S.B. Chaudhuri<sup>259</sup> says that the Madras held the portion in
the Doab between the Chenab and the Ravi, possibly com-
prising even a portion of the country between the Jhelum and
the Chenab, and thus abutted on Kaikeya on the West.
We get a clue to the inhabitance of the Madras from a verse
in the Karṇaparvan of the Mahābhārata<sup>260</sup> which refers to a
Madra, who had come to live among the Kurus, as yearning
for his return to his native place beyond the Śatadru and the
Irāvatī to enjoy the company of charming women.
<div n="P"/>Śākala (Pali-Sagala, modern Sialkot) was the capital of the
{%Madras%} identified<sup>261</sup> with Sanglawala-Tiba, to the West of the
Ravi. From the Milinda-pañho, we learn that king Milinda
(Menander) a Graeco-Bactrian king, who became a convert to
Buddhism, was ruling over the Madda country with Sagala as
his capital which according to a Buddhist lexicon, was one of
the twenty ancient cities.<sup>262</sup> The brahminical name<sup>263</sup> of the
Madra Capital was Śākala mentioned by Pāṇini<sup>264</sup> as Sānkala.
In the Mahābhārata<sup>265</sup> and the Jātakas<sup>266</sup> Śākala is described
as standing on the bank of the Āpagā in a tongue of land
between two rivers, called the Śākaladvīpa, which corresponds
to the Rechna Doab.
<div n="P"/>We know from the Mahābhārata about Śalya, king of the
Madras (Madrarāja). <sup>267</sup> After severe fighting, and many
vicissitudes, the Madra soldiers were killed by Arjuna.<sup>268</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Madras are mentioned in the Purāṇas as well.<sup>269</sup> The
Viṣṇu Purāṇa<sup>270</sup> refers to the Madras along with the Ārāmas,
Pārasīkas, and others and in the Matsya Purāṇa<sup>271</sup> with
Gāndhāra, Yavana and others. The latter<sup>272</sup> mentions king
Aśvapati of Śākala in the kingdom of the {%Madras.%}
<div n="P"/>The {%Madras,%} according to the Arthaśāstra of Kauṭilya<sup>273</sup>
were a corporation of warriors and people enjoyed the title of
{%rājan (rājaśabdopajīvinaḥ).%}<sup>274</sup>
[Page-146+ 39]
<div n="P"/>Madra women were noted for their beauty. <sup>275</sup> The Jātakas
bear ample testimony to the fact that the Madra princesses
were sought in marriage by the great kṣatriya house of North
India.<sup>276</sup> The Mahābhārata tells us that it was a family custom
of the {%Madras%} to receive a fee from the bridegroom when they
gave their daughters in marriage.<sup>277</sup>
<div n="P"/>Some scholars identify the {%Madras%} with Vāhlika (or
Vāhīka).<sup>278</sup> Śākala as a Vāhīkagrāma is also mentioned by
Patañjali.<sup>279</sup> From the references in the Mahābhārata, Vāhīka
would appear to have stood for the whole of Punjab.<sup>280</sup> The
Vāhīka-grāmas of Śākala and Pātanaprastha, as referred to
in the grammatical works,<sup>281</sup> imply the inclusion of {%Madra-%}
{%janapada%} in the Vāhīka country.
<div n="P"/>The {%Madras%} are known as low, barbarous<sup>282</sup> and sinful
people.<sup>283</sup> They are mentioned as base, impure and contemp-
tible.<sup>284</sup> “Amongst the Madrakas all acts of friendship are
lost”<sup>285</sup> and so it is said: “Neither one should create enmity, nor
friendship with a Madraka”.<sup>286</sup> The Rājataraṅgiṇī also records
similar views.<sup>287</sup>
<div n="P"/>But the advent of the {%Jarttikas%} or {%Jartas%} (modern Jāṭs) who
spread over the whole of Punjab was responsible for the degene-
ration of the Madras.<sup>288</sup> The legend of Sāvitrī and Satyavan
is connected with the Madra country, for Sāvitrī was the
daughter of Aśvapati, king of Madra.<sup>289</sup> In the Udyogaparvan
the camp of Śalya is described as full of warriors, whose strange
armours, bows and banners, unfamiliar trappings, vehicles and
equipment and local costumes, ornaments and deportment
presented a unique spectacle in the country of the Kurus. <sup>290</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the early part of the sixth century A.D. the Madra
country passed under the rule of the Hūṇa conqueror Mihira-
kula (A.D. 515-535) who ruled from Sialkot. The Madras
continued to flourish even up to the time of the Pāla king
Dharmapāla in the 9th century A.D.<sup>291</sup>
