16. {%Yajñarāta-kṣetra%}¦ (No. 52, L. 27):
The field of Yajñarāta. Yajña means sacrifice or worship and
rāta means ‘given’ presented, bestowed’.<sup>522</sup> The whole will
literally mean ‘given by Yajña’. The field may be a place of
worship or sacrifice. Because of the performance of Yajña on a
certain occasion the field came to be so named as if it was a
permanent place of sacrifice or the field might have been named
after a person ‘Yajñarāta’.
