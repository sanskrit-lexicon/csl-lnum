16. {%Saṃgohalikagrāma%}¦ (No. 43, L. 2, L. 20):
Saṃgohālika was the name of a village. In L. 2 we get the form
Saṃgohāli, while in L. 20, it is mentioned as Saṃgohalikā-
grāma.<sup>432</sup> Sircar takes the reading to be ‘Gulmagandhikā-
grāma’ in place of Saṃgohālikagrāma.<sup>433</sup> But Saṃgohālika-
grāma is the correct form. We can compare Saṃgohāli in L. 2
of this inscription with the letters appearing in L. 20. The first
[Page-244+ 37]
three letters are no doubt not fully legible, but the two remain-
ing are surely ‘lika’. Thus the name can never be Gulmagan-
dhikā, most probably it was Saṃgohālika. Moreover, the
context of both the lines 20 and 2 is the same.
<div n="P"/>The word gohālī when joined with the suffix ‘saṃ’ means
‘a good gohālī’. In Inscription No. 28 the word gohālī has in
all cases been spelt with long ‘ī’, i. e. gohālī.<sup>434</sup>
