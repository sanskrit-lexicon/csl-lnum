7. {%Gulmagandhikā%}¦ (No. 43, LL. 1-2, L. 22):
It is the name of a village. It occurs once in lines 1-2 and twice
in L. 22.<sup>415</sup>
<div n="P"/>Gulma means ‘a cluster of trees’<sup>416</sup> and gandhikā means
‘having the smell of’.<sup>417</sup> The whole will literally mean ‘a place
which is full of a cluster of trees having smell’. We may
conjecture that the village originally possessed a few shrubs or
small trees which produced fragrance.
