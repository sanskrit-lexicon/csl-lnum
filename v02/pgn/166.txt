2. {%Māra (viṣa)%}¦ (No. 55, LL. 2-3):
He was the father of Dāmasvāminī who raised a pillar at
Rājaghāṭ, Vārāṇasī; in memory of her parents. The first part
of the name is Māra which is the name of the god of love who
in the Buddhist literature is described as the greatest enemy of
the Buddha and his religion.<sup>83</sup> The second part of the name is
not legible. If it is {%viṣa%} then the whole can literally mean ‘one
who is a poison for the god of love’, i.e., a man of great
self-control whom the arrows of Māra cannot affect.
