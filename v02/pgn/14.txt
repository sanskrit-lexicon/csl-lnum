14. {%Viṣṇugupta%}¦ (No. 38, L. 4):
Viṣṇugupta is mentioned here as a {%Paramabhāgavata%} and
{%Mahārājādhirāja.%} He was the son and successor of Kumāra-
gupta III who in his turn was the son and successor of
Narasiṃhagupta. Unfortunately the name of the mother of
Viṣṇugupta (and the wife of Kumārgupta III) has been lost in
the portion of the last line.
<div n="P"/>The Kalighat hoard<sup>105</sup> contained besides Candragupta II's
coins those of Narasiṃhagupta, Kumāragupta III and Viṣṇu-
gupta. Altekar identified Viṣṇugupta of the coins with the
homonymous ruler of the later Gupta family of Magadha,
who flourished in the eighth century A.D.<sup>106</sup> At that time the
learned professor had no knowledge of this seal of an earlier
Viṣṇugupta.
<div n="P"/>His name is clearly based on god Viṣṇu.
