5. {%Rāmī%}¦ (No. 28, LL. 4, 12, 17):
She has been mentioned as the wife of a brāhmaṇa, named
Nāthaśarman.
<div n="P"/>Rāmī means ‘darkness or night’. <sup>11</sup> It may mean ‘a woman
of dark complexion’ or it can be a patronymic from Rāma.<sup>12</sup>
Monier Williams mentions the form with short {%‘i’%} suffix (Rāmi)
but it can be with long {%‘ī’%} as well, as we have ‘Devakī’ a
patronymic from Devaka.<sup>13</sup> Chatterji mentions it to be a
feminine form of Rāma and considers it a naming pattern
prevalent among the lower classes<sup>14</sup>
