9. {%Nepāla%}¦ (No. I, L. 22):
It is mentioned as one of the border states which accepted the
subordination of Samudragupta. Some take it to refer to
Tippera<sup>622</sup> which is doubtful.<sup>623</sup> The city is said to have been
founded by Ne ṛṣi who performed his religious services at the
junction of the Bāgmatī and Kesāvatī and who also ruled over
the country.<sup>624</sup> The Nepāla valley originally contained a lake
called Nāga Bāsa or Kālihrada, in which lived Nāga Karkoṭaka.
It was fourteen miles in length and four miles in breadth<sup>625</sup>
<div n="P"/>The former name of Nepāla was Śleṣmātakavana.<sup>626</sup> The
famous temple of Paśupatinātha on the western bank of the
Bāgmatī river, is situated about three miles north west of
Kathmandu in the town of Devipatan said to have been founded
by Aśoka's daughter Cārumatī.<sup>627</sup> The Śaktisaṅgama Tantra
describes the country of Nepāla as placed between Jaṭeśvara
and Yoginī.<sup>628</sup> Sircar equates Yoginīpura with Delhi and
Jaṭeśvara with Jalpeśvara, the famous Śiva of the Jalpaiguri
district in North Bengal.<sup>629</sup>
<div n="P"/>Nepāla was a buffer state in the 7th century A.D. In
the 8th century A.D. she shook of its domination by Tibet.<sup>630</sup>
According to the Deopara inscription, Nānyadeva, the ruler
of Nepāla, is said to have been defeated and imprisoned with
many other princes by Vijayasena, about the middle of the
12th century A.D.<sup>631</sup>
