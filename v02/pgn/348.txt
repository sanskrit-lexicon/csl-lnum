5. {%Lāṭa<sup>139</sup>%}¦ (No. 17, L. 3)
The district or viṣaya of Lāṭa is here described as “pleasing
with choice trees that are bowed down by the weight of (their)
flowers, and with temples and assembly-halls of the gods, and
with vihāras, (and) the mountains of which are covered over
with vegetation”.
<div n="P"/>The country south of Mahī or at times south of the Nar-
badā up to the Pūrva or so far as Daman, was called Lāṭa and
‘it corresponded roughly with Southern Gujarat’.<sup>140</sup> It comp-
rised the collectorates of Surat, Bharoch, Kheda and parts of
Baroda territory.<sup>141</sup>
<div n="P"/>According to Prof. Bühler, Lāṭa is Central Gujarat, the
district between the Mahī and Kim rivers and its chief city was
Broach.<sup>142</sup> Lāṭa has been identified with Central and Southern
Gujarat in the Rewah Stone Inscription of Karṇa.<sup>143</sup> We also
find the Lāṭa kingdom mentioned in other epigraphical reco-
rds.<sup>144</sup> Lāṭarāṣṭra<sup>145</sup> is identical with the old Lāṭa kingdom of
Gujarat, the capital city of which is stated in the Dīpavaṃśa to
have been Siṃapura (Sīhapura).<sup>146</sup> In the early days of the
imperial Guptas, the Lāṭa country was formed into an admini-
strative province in the Lāṭaviṣaya.<sup>147</sup> The Śaktisaṅgam Tantra
places the Lāṭa country to the west of Avanti and to the north-
west of Vidarbha.<sup>148</sup>
<div n="P"/>Lāṭa is the same as the Larike of Ptolemy which lay to the
east of Indo-Scythia along the sea-coast.<sup>149</sup> The word Lāṭa is
[Page-219+ 38]
derived from Sanskrit Rāṣṭra.<sup>150</sup> The Nāgara brāhmaṇas of
Lāṭa (Gujarat) are said to have invented the Nāgarī character
which is believed to have been derived from the Brāhmī alpha-
bet.<sup>151</sup>
