3. {%Vīrasena%}¦ (No. 6, L. 4):
Hailing from Pāṭaliputra he was Candragupta II's minister
for peace and war by hereditary right<sup>60</sup> and accompanied the
king on his far-reaching military expeditions. The first part is
Vīra which means ‘brave’ and the second is {%‘sena’,%} the whole
literally meaning ‘one with a brave army’. Pāṇini refers to
{%Senānta%} names in his Aṣṭādhyāyī.<sup>61</sup> We find many such
names as Vārisena, Ṛṣṭiṣeṇa, Bhīmasena and Ugrasena.<sup>62</sup>
U.N. Roy conjectures the possibility of the composition
of the {%‘Praśasti’%} inscribed on the Meharauli Iron Pillar
Inscription by Śāba alias Vīrasena who was an accomplished
poet and a favourite minister of Candragupta II, Vikramā-
ditya.<sup>63</sup> It is possible that he outlived his patron and when
during a {%Dharmayātrā%} he revisited the spot where the lofty
banner had been raised as a mark of homage to Lord Viṣṇu
after the victory over the Vāhlikas, was moved to compose
and inscribe this {%Praśasti%} on the Meharauli Pillar.<sup>64</sup>
