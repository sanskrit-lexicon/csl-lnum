12. {%Samataṭa%}¦ (No. 1, L. 22):
It is one of the frontier kingdoms which offered their sub-
mission to Samudragupta.<sup>645</sup> Sen<sup>646</sup> remarks that Samudra-
gupta reduced the king of Samataṭa to the rank of a subordi-
nate prince who had to part with most of his powers and was
‘allowed to rule over a much reduced dominion as a vassal of
the emperor’. Retaining only the control of its internal ad-
ministration, he had to pay various kinds of taxes to Samudra-
gupta, attend his durbars, render obeisance to him and gratify
[Page-261+ 39]
his imperious commands.<sup>647</sup> Samataṭa is the only territory in
Bengal to be referred to in the Allahabed Praśasti.<sup>648</sup> The
first epigraphic reference to Samataṭa is to be found in this
inscription.<sup>649</sup> Literally the name means ‘the shore country’
or ‘Level country’.<sup>650</sup> ‘Samataṭa in the Gupta period denoted
a territory lying to the east of the Brahmaputra’. The Bṛhat-
saṃhitā mentions it as a country situated in the East.<sup>651</sup> The
Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsang proceeded from Kāmarūpa
southwards and after a journey of 1,200 or 1,300 li (6 li-
1 mile) reached the country of Samataṭa. According to him,
this country was on the seaside and was low and moist and
was more than 3,000 li in circuit.<sup>652</sup> From Samataṭa, the
pilgrim journeyed towards the West for over 900 li and
reached Tanmolihti,<sup>653</sup> or Tāmralipta, the modern Tamluk in
the Midnāpur district.<sup>654</sup> Samataṭa, therefore, must have been
the South-eastern part of the Bengal presidency corresponding
to the Dacca, Faridpur, Backerganj, Jessore and Khulna
districts.<sup>655</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is known from the Baghaura Inscription<sup>656</sup> that the
Tipperah district was in Samataṭa. The Ārya-Mañjuśrī Mūla-
kalpa states that Samataṭa was situated to the east of the
Lohitya.<sup>657</sup> The Yādavaprakāśa equates Bhaurika with
Samataṭa.<sup>658</sup>
<div n="P"/>Epigraphical evidence, however, shows that Samataṭa com-
prised the districts of Comilla, Noakhali and Sylhat.<sup>659</sup> Its
capital Karmmanta has been identified with Baḍ-Kāmatā, 12
miles west of Comilla district.<sup>660</sup> After the rule of the Guptas,
Samataṭa was successively under the Khaḍga, Candra, Varman
and Sena dynasties.<sup>661</sup>
