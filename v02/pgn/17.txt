3. {%Bhānugupta%}¦ (No. 19, L. 5):
He is known only from No. 19. His no other coin or seal has
yet come to light. As regards the position of Bhānugupta, seve-
ral alternatives are possible. First, he may have been a succes-
sor of Vainyagupta and the dominions of both may have
included parts of Eastern Malwa. Second, Vainyagupta may have
been the lord of the eastern part of the Gupta Empire when its
western part was being ruled by Bhānugupta. Third, Bhānu-
gupta may have been a viceroy in the Malwa region like
Govindagupta and Ghaṭotkacagupta. It is possible that he be-
longed to the Imperial Gupta line but whether he succeeded
Vainygupta, or the two ruled at the same time respectively
over the western and eastern parts of the empire, is difficult to
determine. The latter view seems more probable and this in-
ternal dissension perhaps paved the way for the downfall of the
empire.<sup>117</sup> Bhānugupta, in spite of the high encomiums paid to
his bravery in Eraṇ Inscription, remains a shadowy figure, and
we do not know what was his position in the Gupta Imperial
family, or what part he played in the dark days of the Gupta
empire.<sup>118</sup>
<div n="P"/>His name is based on the god Sun ‘Bhānu’.
