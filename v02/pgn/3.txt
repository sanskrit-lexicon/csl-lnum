3. {%Candragupta I:%}¦ (No. 47, L. 2; No. 53, L. 2; No. 40, L. 3;
No. 21, L. 5; No. 1, L. 28; No. 30, L. 1):
While his two predecessors are each given the title of
{%Mahārāja,%} Candragupta I is described in the inscriptions as
{%Mahārājādhirāja,%} ‘king of kings’. Mookerjee connects the passage
from the Purāṇas defining the extent of the Gupta territory
with the period before Samudragupta, i.e., under Candragupta
I.<sup>53</sup> It has been suggested that Caṇḍasena of the play ‘Kaumudī-
Mahotsava’ is to be identified with Candragupta I. The
Licchavi alliance is the common point in the account given by
the drama and the inscriptions.<sup>54</sup> Other details of the drama,
however, do not support this identification. The drama
condemns Caṇḍasena as an usurper and belonging to low caste
whom the citizens of Magadha could not tolerate and drove out
to die in exile. Linguistically also Caṇḍasena and Candragupta
are different names. Candra can become Caṇḍa in Prakrit but
Gupta cannot be transformed into Sena. Moreover, in the fifth
act of the play we are informed through a character Lokākṣī
that the cursed Caṇḍasena has been killed and his royal family
uprooted.<sup>55</sup> Thus we know about the total annihilation of the
dynasty after the death of Caṇḍasena which is not applicable
to the dynasty of Caṇḍragupta which ruled for several genera-
tions after him.<sup>56</sup> The name of the deity {%Candra%} ‘moon’ has
been given to this king; Gupta is the surname. It may refer
to his handsome physical features.
