17. {%Sāhānuṣāhi%}¦<sup>416</sup> (No. 1, L. 23):
Ṣāhānuṣāhis are also mentioned to have paid homage to
Samudragupta along with other tribes. The Ṣāhānuṣāhis are
to be identified with the Sassanids or the Sassanian kings. The
title {%‘Sāhānuṣāhi (śahān-śāh)%} has frequently been used by the
Sassanian kings.<sup>417</sup> The contemporary Sassanian emperor was
Shahpur II (A.D. 309-379).<sup>418</sup> The Sassanians are known to
have been the rulers of Persia from A.D. 211 to 651.<sup>419</sup> Accord-
ing to tradition the dynasty is named after its founder Sassan.
His son and successor Papaka, seized power by a coup d'etat
against his suzerain, the Parthian king and his accession was
the starting point for a new era (A.D. 208).<sup>420</sup>
<div n="P"/>Goyal<sup>421</sup> confuses the Sassanians with the Pārasīkas of
Kālidāsa. But they were different from the Pārasīkas. The
Sassanians had founded a powerful kingdom in Persia, but they
had not yet conquered the whole of Persia.<sup>422</sup> The Pārasīkas
of Kālidāsa were the Ṣāhis.<sup>423</sup> Though the possibility of a
Kuṣāṇa-Sassanian coalition may not be ruled out it seems that
at the time of Samudragupta,<sup>424</sup> three kings the Daivaputra (the
Kuṣāṇas), the Ṣāhi (the Persians or the Pārasīkas of Kālidāsa),
and the Ṣāhānuṣāhi (the Sassanians) were ruling indepen-
dently.<sup>425</sup>
<div n="P"/>Buddha Prakash<sup>426</sup> traces the Khatri sub-castes Sahni and
Osahan as the remnants of the title ‘Ṣāhānuṣāhi’. But this is
far-fetched. So far as Sahni is concerned it is to be connected
with Sādhanika the name of an officer in the administration of
the early medieval period.<sup>427</sup>
<div n="P"/>It may be noted that the Sassanian title Śahan-Śāh was
used for the Great Emperor in Mughal period, which usage
continues. In popular parlance the term is used for calling or
