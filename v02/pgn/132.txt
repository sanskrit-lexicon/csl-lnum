1. {%Gaṇḍa%}¦ (No. 43, L. 4):
According to lexicographers Gaṇḍa means ‘the chief; best,
excellent’<sup>43</sup> and thus can signify a hero. The term is also used
for the animal rhinoceros, so it can also be a case of a name
based on the name of an animal.
<div n="P"/>The custom of deriving names from animals was unknown
in the Vedic period.<sup>44</sup> But in Pāṇini we find such references.<sup>45</sup>
