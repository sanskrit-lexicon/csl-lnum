9. {%Jitasena%}¦ (No. 52, L. 30):
The first part of the name {%‘Jita’%} means ‘won’. ‘Sena’ the second
part of the name, generally refers to an army but in the present
case we may translate it better as ‘body’ which is supported by
lexicographers.<sup>36</sup> Thus the whole may literally mean ‘One who
has won the body’, i.e. one having control over one's senses’.
This would suit the context because Jitasena was an ācāryya
of the Buddhist order.<sup>37</sup>
