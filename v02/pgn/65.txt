1. {%Āmrakārddava%}¦ (No. 5, L. 5):
Hailing from Sukuli-deśa who loyally served Candragupta
II by fighting and winning many battles for him.
<div n="P"/>The first part of the name is based on the mango tree.
The second part is {%kārddava.<sup>56</sup>%} It is the name of some Nāgas
or serpent-demons thought to be inhabitants of the lower
regions.<sup>57</sup> Kadru is the name of the mother of serpents.
Kādrava by metathesis becomes Kārddava which literally
means ‘born of Kadru’. In south, among aboriginal people
and lower castes, the practice of matriarchal names is well
known. The whole term ‘Āmrakārddava’ is inexplicable as one
word. Āmra seems to be his personal name and Kārddava his
family title.
