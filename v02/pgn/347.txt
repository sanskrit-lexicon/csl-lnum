4. {%Kṛmilā%}¦ (No. 40, L. 5):
The Viṣaya or district of Kṛmilā also spelt as Krimilā is mention-
ed in inscription No. 40. According to D.C. Sircar “as the
charter is spurious and seems to have been forged a few centu-
ries after Samudragupta's time, it may or may not prove the
existence of a viṣaya and therefore of a city of the above name
in the fourth century.<sup>122</sup> But certain old seals found at Nālandā
prove the existence of Kṛmilā before the Pāla occupation of
Bihar.<sup>123</sup> The village Kavāla in the Krimilāviṣaya known from
one such seal can be identified with modern Kawāli not far
from Valgūdar.<sup>124</sup> The viṣaya or district of Kṛmilā is also men-
tioned in the records of the Pālas of Bengal and Bihar.<sup>125</sup>
<div n="P"/>According to a tradition recorded in the Harivaṃśa,<sup>126</sup>
Vayu Purāṇa<sup>127</sup> and the Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa<sup>128</sup> Kṛmi, the son
of king Uśīnara of the Puru dynasty, born of his second queen
Kṛmi, was the lord of Kṛmilāpurī.<sup>129</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Buddhist literature, we get various forms for the city
of Kṛmilā: Kimilā, Kimmilā and Kimbilā. The name of an
inhabitant of the city is given as Kimila, Kimmilā or Kimbilā.
Malālasekera<sup>130</sup> recognises the spellings Kimilā or Kimbilā and
Kimila or Kimbila, but prefers the forms Kimbilā and Kimbilā.
Kimilā can be the Pali form of Sanskrit Kṛmilā (or Krimilā),
and Kimmilā can be derived from the other Sanskrit variant
Kirmilā.<sup>131</sup> Two Suttas, the Kimilāsutta and Kimilasutta, were
preached by the Buddha when he was camping at the city of
Kimilā (Kṛmilā) said to have been situated on the bank of the
Gaṅgā. The river is now at a short distance from the villages
of Valgūdar and Rajauna, on the site of which the ancient city
stood.<sup>132</sup>
<div n="P"/>M.S. Pandey<sup>133</sup> opposes the identification of Kṛmilā with
Valgūdar on the ground that there is not sufficient evidence
to prove this identification. Though Kṛmilā is not referred to
in early Pali literature, we find a city named Kṛmilā mention-
ed in the Aṅguttara Nikāya Commentary.<sup>134</sup> According to this
commentary, the city stood on the bank of the Gaṅgā. But
now-a-days, the Gaṅgā flows at some distance from this region
which may be due to a change in the course of the river dur-
ing so many centuries. The city was not very important and
may have gradually disappeared. At present we do not find
[Page-218+ 39]
any traces of the city: it may have been washed away by the
Gaṅgā. According to Pandey<sup>135</sup> the name of the modern villa-
ge Kiul has some resemblance with the name Kṛmilā and it is
not unlikely that the city may have been somewhere in that
locality.
<div n="P"/>Sircar is himself not sure about the identification of Kṛmilā
with Valgūdar<sup>136</sup> and seems to prefer the claim of modern
Kawali not being far from Valgūdar Kṛmilā.<sup>137</sup> But in the
district Gazetteer of Monghyr it is the village of Kiul which
is mentioned and not Kawali. Hence we prefer the view of
Dr. Pandey.
<div n="P"/>The word Kṛmilā means “a fruitful woman” or “a place
full of worms” and the word Kṛmi forming its first part is
sometimes also written as Krimi.<sup>138</sup>
