3. {%Koṭivarṣa%}¦ (No. 34, L. 3; No. 35, L. 3; No. 36, L. 3; No. 37, L. 3):
It has been described as a viṣaya under Puṇḍravardhana-bhukti.
This reference clearly shows that the size of a viṣaya was small-
er than that of a bhukti. The viṣaya of Koṭivarṣa occurs frequ-
ently in the epigraphic records of the Pālas and Senas.<sup>107</sup> It
seems to have comprised the southern part of the Dinajpur
district, the northern portion of Rajashahi and probably also
the eastern tracts of the Bogra district.<sup>108</sup> Its head-quarters was
Diw-kot (Devakoṭa or Devīkoṭa).<sup>109</sup> Yādavaprakāśa identifies
Koṭivarṣa with Devīkoṭṭa.<sup>110</sup> The Vāyu Purāṇa also refers to a
city of the name of Koṭivarṣa.<sup>111</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Prakrit lexicon Pāia-sadda-mahaṇṇavo describes it as
the capital of Lāṭa country.<sup>112</sup> The name is known to the Jain
Prajñāpanā in which it is placed in Lāḍha or Lāṭa.<sup>113</sup>
<div n="P"/>Hemacandra<sup>114</sup> says that Koṭivarṣa, Bāṇapura, Devīkoṭa,
Umāvana and Śoṇitapura are identical. Puruṣottama<sup>115</sup> agrees
with Hemacandra with the only difference that he mentions
Uṣāvana in place of Umāvana. Bāṇapura is represented by
Bāngarh in the Dinajpur district, which still preserves the exten-
sive ruins of a citadel known as Damdamaḥ said to have been
the fort of Devīkoṭa associated with the exploits of the mythi-
cal king Bāṇa.<sup>116</sup> Diw-koṭa or Devīkoṭa (wrongly read as Dihi-
kota in the A-In-i-Akbarī) was a mahal under the Sarkar of
Lakhnautī (Lakṣaṇavatī).<sup>117</sup>
<div n="P"/>The termination varṣa is significant. It denotes a division
of the earth as separated off by mountain ranges.<sup>118</sup> From the
Purāṇas we know of such names as Harivarṣa, Kiṃpuruṣa-
Varṣa and Bhārata-Varṣa.<sup>119</sup> Varṣam in Pāṇini<sup>120</sup> means the
rainy season. We know that rains are connected with the moun-
tains. So originally the divisions might have been made accord-
ing to the rains in different areas. Rains being very important
for agriculture affect the inhabitants of a certain area through-
out the year. Later on the semantic development of the word
came to denote a year. In India the seasons have been regard-
ed to be important and hence they had often been used to
[Page-217+ 40]
denote the year.<sup>121</sup>
