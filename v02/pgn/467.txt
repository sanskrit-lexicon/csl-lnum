4. {%Vaṅga%}¦ (No. 20, L. I):
In this inscription, king Candra, “on whose arm fame was
inscribed by the sword, when in battle in Vaṅga countries, is
stated to have kneaded, back with his breast the enemies who,
uniting together, came against him”.<sup>713</sup> This is taken by
scholars<sup>714</sup> to be the first epigraphic mention of Vaṅga. The
Vaṅgas here mean the ‘Vaṅga country’ the eastern Bengal of
modern times. Bajpai is of the opinion that the Vaṅgas
of the Meharaulī Pillar Inscription of Candra (No. 20) are the
people living in the Makaran coast of Baluchistan.<sup>715</sup> But the
Vaṅgas here denote country and not the people. Moreover, the
victory of king Candra over the Vaṅga countries has no con-
nection with his conquest of the Vāhlikas. Both are separately
mentioned in his campaign. In Sanskrit the tribal name in the
plural is regularly used to indicate the country inhabited by the
tribe.<sup>716</sup> The Vaṅga countries are also referred to in the
Mahākūṭa Pillar Inscription,<sup>717</sup> but in the inscriptions after
the 9th century A.D. the word Vaṅgāla is usually mention-
ed.<sup>718</sup>
<div n="P"/>The earliest mention of the Vaṅgas along with the Magadhas
is in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka.<sup>719</sup> The name is also found in the
Baudhāyana Dharma-Sūtra<sup>720</sup> where the Vaṅgas are mentioned
as impure people.<sup>721</sup> But the Drama ‘Pratijñā-Yaugandha-
rāyaṇa’ (Act II), ascribed to Bhāsa and probably not older
than the 4th century A.D., suggests that the ruling families of
Bengal were regarded as equals to those of Northern India for
intermarriage with the royal family of Mālava.<sup>722</sup>
<div n="P"/>The people of Vaṅga are stated to have fought in the Kuru-
kshetra war<sup>723</sup> and, in course of his expedition Bhīṣma is said
to have defeated Samudrasena of Vaṅga.<sup>724</sup> The Kāśikā men-
tions Vāṅgaka to explain Pāṇini's sūtra (IV. 3. 100) denoting
[Page-267+ 38]
loyalty of the citizen to the state.<sup>725</sup> Pāṇini mentions Vāṅgī
(the lady of Vaṅga Janapada) along with Avantī, Kurū and
Yaudheyī.<sup>726</sup> Patañjali also refers to the Vaṅgas by way of
illustration.<sup>727</sup> Kauṭilya makes similar references to the
country.<sup>728</sup> The Bhāgavata Purāṇa also mentions it as a
country.<sup>729</sup> Kālidāsa states that Raghu after conquering the
Sumhas,<sup>730</sup> defeated the Vaṅgas with his force.<sup>731</sup> The Kāvya-
mīmāṃsā mentions Vaṅga as a janapada situated in the east.<sup>732</sup>
The Bṛhatsaṃhitā also mentions it in the east along with Upa-
Vaṅga.<sup>733</sup>
<div n="P"/>According to the Mahābhārata<sup>734</sup> Vaṅga, son of Bali, had
established this country. The Amarakośa<sup>735</sup> mentions Vaṅga
as a synonym of Raṅga (lead), but lead is not available
in Bengal and is found in abundance in Malaya, Pegu and
East Indies. People in other parts of India may have received
lead through the people of East Bengal. Suśruta also uses
Vaṅga in the same sense as Amara does<sup>736</sup>
<div n="P"/>R.C. Banerji<sup>737</sup>, on the basis of the Ablur Inscription of the
Kalacuri king Bijjala<sup>738</sup> takes Vaṅga and Vaṅgāla as two dis-
tinct people or tribes. This view has been correctly refuted by
S.B. Chaudhuri<sup>739</sup> who concludes that Vaṅgāla was within Vaṅga
and hence was not altogether a separate geographical entity
as is maintained by some.
<div n="P"/>The confusion may be due to the fact that the geographi-
cal location of the Vaṅga country changed in different periods.
The same country Vaṅga was known as Vaṅgāla with the addi-
tion of the Prakrit suffix {%‘āla’%}<sup>740</sup> which was transliterated by the
Muslims as Bangālah (pronouncing Bangāla) in their script<sup>741</sup>
and this was changed into Bengal by the English people.
<div n="P"/>The Yādavaprakāśa equates Vaṅga with Harikeli<sup>742</sup> but
the Kalpadrukośa, a work of the seventeenth century states that
Śrīhaṭṭa is Harikeli.<sup>743</sup> The commentary of Yaśodhara on the
Kāmasūtra refers to Vaṅga as situated to the east of the
Brahmaputra.<sup>744</sup>
