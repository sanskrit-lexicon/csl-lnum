(4) {%Indrapura%}¦ (No. 16, L. 5, L. 6, L. 7, L. 8):
The inscription states that an endowment was given by a brāh-
maṇa named Devaviṣṇu for the maintenance of a lamp in a
temple of the Sun established by the merchants of the town of
Indrapura kṣatriyas named Acalavarman and Bhrukuṇṭhasiṃha
at Indrapura.
<div n="P"/>In line 5 we get ‘Candrāpuraka-Padmā’ as the reading
taken by Fleet<sup>251</sup> and he thus considers it a separate town than
Indrapura.<sup>252</sup> But the correct reading should be as ‘Cendra-
puraka-Padmā’, since we find a small stroke by the left side of
‘c’. The stroke in other lines for ‘e’ is very clear (e. g. in L. 2)
though it is not very clear in L. 5 still we cannot read it simply
‘c’. The reading ‘ce’ for ‘c’ has been suggested by Sircar and
Jagannath.<sup>253</sup> Thus we see that the Padmā referred in line 5
[Page-228+ 39]
of this inscription also belongs to Indrapura.
<div n="P"/>Now we find two different spellings of Indrāpura in lines 5
and 6 and Indrapura in lines 7 and 8.<sup>254</sup>
<div n="P"/>What we can find out here is that the affix ‘ka’ in lines 5
and 6 is very important which seems to have grammatically a
succinct purpose here. The vṛddhi of the first vowel ‘i’ was
desirable here as is also clear by the use of affix ‘ka’ in the
Allahabad Inscription of Samudragupta.<sup>255</sup> So it is a weaker
form of the affix ‘ka’, without vṛddhi of the vowel in the first
syllable.<sup>256</sup> The writer seems to have used the long vowel
(with the last syllable of Indra) instead of vṛddhi in the first
syllable to avoid confusion between Aindrapura and Indrapura.
We do not find any such example of the elongation of vowel
in the classical Sanskrit literature though we find its rare use
in Vedic literature.<sup>257</sup> So we shall translate ‘Indrāpuraka Pad-
mā’ as ‘Padmā of (the town of) Indrapura and ‘Indrapuraka-
vaṇigbhyām’ as ‘merchants of (the town of) Indrapura’. This
Indrapura is the same as modern Indor,<sup>258</sup> near Dibhāi, Buland-
shahr district, U.P.<sup>259</sup> The ancient town of Indrapura was
situated on a large and lofty mound about five miles to the
north-west of Dibhāi.<sup>260</sup> Now-a-days it is only a kheḍā or deser-
ted mound, and is not shown in maps<sup>261</sup>
