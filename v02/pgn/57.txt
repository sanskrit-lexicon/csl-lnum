5. {%Viśvavarmman%}¦ (No. 17, L. 14):
A ruler ({%Goptṛ%}) in the time of Kumāragupta I. Literally the
name may mean ‘a protector of the world’. There is a second
possibility that it is a name based on the deity Viṣṇu, because
Viśva meaning all-pervading or all-containing, omnipresent,<sup>45</sup>
is also the name of Viṣṇu-kṛṣṇa.
