(3) {%Chaṇḍagrāma%}¦ (No. 33, L. 3):
The village is difficult to identify.<sup>399</sup> Caṇḍa is the Prakritic
form of Candra<sup>400</sup> which means ‘the moon’. Thus the village
seems to have been named after the Moon-god. But Caṇḍa
may also mean ferocious or turbulent and in that case it may
have been so named because of its wild looks or its violent
population.
