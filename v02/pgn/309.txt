[Page-104+ 39]
{%Upāsikā%} (lay-worshipper) Harisvāminī, was the wife of {%Upāsaka%}
Sanasiddha who donated money to the {%Ārya-saṃgha%} (commu-
nity of the faithful) at the great {%vihāra%} (Buddhist convent) of
Kākanādaboṭa (i. e., the great {%stūpa%} at Sāñcī) for feeding
one {%Bhikṣu%} everyday and maintaining lamps in the shrines of
the Buddha.<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>The first part of the name, Hari, stands alike for Lord
Kṛṣṇa, Viṣṇu and Śiva. The second part is {%‘Svāminī’%} meaning
mistress. Thus the whole literally means ‘one who has Hari
as her master’.
