<div n="P"/>Literally vihāra means ‘a place of recreation or pleasure-
ground’. With Buddhists or Jains it means a monastery
or temple, originally a hall where the monks met or walked
about. Afterwards, these halls were used as assembly halls or
places of worship. The modern province of Bihar or Behar is
so named on account of the large number of Buddhist monas-
teries in it.<sup>478</sup>
