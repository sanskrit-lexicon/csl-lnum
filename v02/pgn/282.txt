6. {%Datilācāryya%}¦ (No. 31, L. 2):
He was a Jaina ācāryya. The correct form of the name should
have been Dattilācārya. The word seems to be in a Prakritised
form. According to Monier Williams<sup>31</sup> ‘Dattila’ is one of the
forms of names terminating in {%‘datta’.%} Names like Devadatta
when contracted may turn into Dattila.<sup>32</sup> Ācāryya seems to be
an epithet.
