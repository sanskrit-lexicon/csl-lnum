(9) {%Piṣṭapura%}¦ (No. 1, L. 19):
It has been mentioned as one of the southern regions which
were first captured and then liberated by Samudragupta.<sup>320</sup>
Mahendragiri is mentioned as its king. Piṣṭapura is the same
as the fortress Piṣṭapura captured by the Cālukya king
Pulakeśin II. The Tāṇḍivāda grant of Pṛthivī Mahārāja also
refers to Piṣṭapura.<sup>321</sup> Piṣṭapura is modern Pithapuram in the
Godavari district of the Madras Presidency.<sup>322</sup> It was the
capital of Kaliṅga.<sup>323</sup> ‘Kaliṅgādhipati’ Anantavarman issued
a grant<sup>324</sup> from the victorious city of Piṣṭapura. This grant
records that Anantavarman's grandfather Guṇavarman ruled
over Devarāṣṭra with Piṣṭapura as its chief city.<sup>325</sup> In our
inscription Devarāṣṭra<sup>326</sup> has been treated separately. It seems
that during Samudragupta's time these two States (Devarāṣṭra
and Kaliṅga) were separate states but later on under Guṇavar-
man they were amalgamated.
<div n="P"/>Guha ruled over the whole of Kaliṅga and the neighbour-
ing regions.<sup>327</sup> Guha belonged to the Sālaṅkāyana family of
brāhmaṇas. Samudragupta installed him as his viceroy in
Kaliṅga.<sup>328</sup> Guha was already reigning over Kaliṅga (with his
capital at Piṣṭapura) when Samudragupta conquered him and
placed him as his feudatory. ‘Mahendragiri’ may have been
another name given to him on account of the extension of
his dominion over the Mahendra mountain.<sup>329</sup> It is interesting
to note that Kālidāsa<sup>330</sup> refers to Raghu defeating a king
named Mahendranātha in the course of his southern campaign.
It is tempting to connect Mahendranātha with Mahendragiri.
After the victory of Samudragupta, Guha was confirmed in
the enjoyment of sovereignty under the imperial tutelage.<sup>331</sup>
<div n="P"/>At Piṣṭapura there is a Vaiṣṇava temple named Kunti-
mādhava.<sup>332</sup> We get references to Piṣṭapurī or Piṣṭapurikādevī,
a form at Mānapura, of the goddess Lakṣmī, in the inscriptions
of the Privrājaka Mahārājas and the Mahārājas of Uccakalpa
during the Gupta period.<sup>333</sup> This must be a local form of some
popular goddess at Piṣṭapura itself.<sup>334</sup>
