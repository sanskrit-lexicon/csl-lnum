9. {%Sindhu%}¦ (No. 20, L. 2):
The river is mentioned in connexion with the description of
the victories of king Candra who is said to have conquered the
Vāhlikas after having crossed the seven mouths of the (river)
Sindhu<sup>50</sup> in warfare. Sindhu in the Ṛgveda<sup>51</sup> and the Athar-
vaveda<sup>52</sup> often means simply a ‘stream’. The Ṛgveda (VIII.
24. 27) refers to ‘Sapta Sindhavaḥ’ or ‘the seven rivers’.<sup>53</sup> But
it is also<sup>54</sup> used in the more exact sense of the ‘stream’ par
excellence or ‘The Indus’. We get a reference to Sindhu as a
river in the Amara-kośa.<sup>55</sup> The territories adjoining it were
famous for horses<sup>56</sup> and salt.<sup>57</sup>
<div n="P"/>The term Sindhu was corrupted to Hindu in the old Per-
sian inscriptions of Darius I (516-485 B.C.), and to Indus by
the Ionian (= Pāṇini's Yavana) Greeks.<sup>58</sup> The word ‘India’ is
derived from the river Sindhu or the Indus.<sup>59</sup> Taking its rise
from the snows of Western Kailāśa in Tibet, the Sindhu first
flows north-west of Kashmir and South of little Pamir, and
then takes a southward course along which lay some of the
important cities of north India. Emerging from the Darad
high-lands, the river (Dāradī Sindhuḥ) enters the Gandhāra
country until it receives its most important western tributary
the Kabul river at Ohind, a few miles north of Attock.<sup>60</sup>
<div n="P"/>The river Sindhu is mentioned in the Purāṇas along with
the Gaṅgā, Sarasvatī, Satluj, Chinab and Yamunā.<sup>61</sup>
<div n="P"/>Vogel suggests that the expression ‘Sindhor sapta mukhāni’
may indicate the ‘sapta sindhavaḥ’ of the Ṛgveda, i. e. the
river Indus and its tributaries. The term mukha would then
be not taken in the sense of ‘the mouth of a river’, but as
meaning a river-head.<sup>62</sup> But the translation of the expression
as done by Fleet (i. e. the seven mouths of the river Indus) is
generally accepted.<sup>63</sup> The seven mouths of the river Indus
thus represent the points of its confluence with its tributaries
[Page-297+ 39]
and not the tributaries individually as suggested by Vogel.
