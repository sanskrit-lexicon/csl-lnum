11. {%Pratyanta%}¦ (No. 1, L. 22):
It is mentioned in Inscription No. 1 that the kings of frontier
(or border) states ‘Samataṭa, Ḍavāka, Kāmarūpa, Nepāla and
Kartṛpura’ gratified the imperious commands of Samudrgupta,
by giving all (kinds of) taxes and obeying (his) orders and
coming to perform obeisance.<sup>639</sup> We also find a reference to
Pratyanta in the Girnar Rock Edict No. 2. of Aśoka.<sup>640</sup>
<div n="P"/>Law<sup>641</sup> contrasts between Āryāvarta and Pratyanta. He
takes Pratyanta to mean the Mleccha country and quotes the
Amarakośa, Divyāvadāna, Abhidhānacintāmaṇi and Smṛti-
candrikā.<sup>642</sup> But in the inscription<sup>643</sup> the contrast is between
Dakṣināpatha and Āryāvarta while the word Āṭavikarāja
breaks the link between Āryāvarta and Pratyanta. Moreover,
all the border states mentioned in the inscription could not
have been Mleccha and inhabited by Kirātas.<sup>644</sup> The word
Pratyanta and its substitutes in the Aśokan edicts also refer to
the frontier states.
