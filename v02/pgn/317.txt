4. {%Daivaputra%}¦<sup>87</sup> (No. 1, L. 23):
Daivaputras along with Ṣāhis, Ṣāhānuṣāhis, Śakas and
Muruṇḍas are mentioned to have paid homage to Samudra-
gupta by rendering to him all kinds of service.
<div n="P"/>The word ‘Daivaputra’ denotes those ‘who belong to
{%devaputra%}’, i. e., Kaniṣka, i. e., the Kuṣāṇa ruler. The title
devaputra has frequently been used as a title by the Kuṣāṇa
kings.<sup>88</sup>
<div n="P"/>The common belief is that the designation {%devaputra%} ‘god-
son’ was copied by the Kuṣāṇas from the ancient Chinese
imperial title, ‘T’ien-tzu’, ‘son of heaven’.<sup>89</sup> Thomas considers
that this title used by the Kuṣāṇas must have been borrowed
from the Hsiung-nu (a Central Asian Tribe) and not directly
from the Chinese.<sup>90</sup> Narain also believes the title to have been
borrowed by the Kuṣāṇas from Central Asia.<sup>91</sup> The title has
been frequently used by the kings in the Kharoṣṭhī documents
discovered from Chinese Turkestan.<sup>92</sup> As regards the origin of
the title, the divinity of the kings has been stressed upon in
many ancient empires.<sup>93</sup> The ancient Indian concept for ‘Deva-
[Page-130+ 39]
putra’<sup>94</sup> meaning ‘god-son’ is slightly different. It was not used
for worldly kings but specifically for a class of distinguished
divinities, which in Indian Buddhist texts was specifically used
for four regional ‘great kings’, i. e., regents of four quarters,
East, West, North and South who were ‘sons of heaven’. In
the later Kuṣāṇa times, the term seems to have denoted the
sense of Royal insignia.<sup>95</sup> In a Buddhist text of this period the
question is raised ‘why kings are called {%devaputra%}’ and the
answer is that before being born as a man, he was abiding
among the gods (devas) and that, because the thirty-three gods
(each) contributed to his substance, therefore, he is ‘god-son’.<sup>96</sup>
<div n="P"/>That Daivaputra denotes the Kuṣāṇas is obvious, since, no
other Indian king is known to have been styled ‘devaputra’.
Though Indian kings were usually addressed as ‘Deva’, we do
not find any evidence of an Indian king referring to himself as
{%deva.%} The Kuṣāṇas did not adopt {%devaputra%} as an official title
in early times. It is totally absent from their coins, its reading
on one coin of Kujula Kara Kaphsa being an error which
has been noticed by Thomas after re-examining the coin in
consultation with Allan.<sup>97</sup> Kaniṣka has not used the title even
in Peshawar Casket Inscriptions which were officially engraved.
It is only in documents inscribed by Indians that the title
{%‘devaputra’%} is used for the Kuṣāṇa kings.<sup>98</sup> The title is used for
the first time for Kaniṣka (known as Candana Kaniṣka).<sup>99</sup>
{%Mahārāja -rājātirāja devaputra%} Kuṣāṇa of the Taxila Silver
Scroll Inscription is generally taken to refer to Kaniṣka.<sup>100</sup>
As rightly observed by Thomas “the devaputrasa of the scroll
inscription is the first known instance of the application to
the Kuṣāṇas of the designation devaputra, which regularly,
though not invariably, recurs with Kaniṣka and his succes-
sors.”<sup>101</sup>
<div n="P"/>Thus we do not find the title Devaputra being used by
the Kuṣāṇa rulers themselves but was applied to them by the
Indians. Why of all ruling dynasties only the Kuṣāṇas were
designated as ‘Devaputras’ is really inexplicable. Thomas
suggests two possibilities. It may be due to the fact that the
Indians saw some similarity between the figures of the grand
Yakṣa and those of the burly Kusāṇa kings and the superior
title of ‘Devaputra’ may have appeared to be a suitable appel-
[Page-131+ 39]
lation. Another possibility is that they found some similarity
between the Kuṣāṇa kings and Kubera (described in India as
regent of the north and god of wealth and known as Devaputra
in ancient Indian concept of Devaputra which simply means
god-son), especially in view of the lavish gold coinage of the
Kuṣāṇas. Aśvaghoṣa refers to the ‘great king Kanika’ as
‘guardian of the northern heaven’.<sup>102</sup> It is also likely that
the title devaputra may have been given due to Śiva-maheśvara,
whom we have seen styled as Devaputra and who is the sole
deity figured on the coins of Wima Kadphises.<sup>103</sup> These facts
need further investigation.
<div n="P"/>Most probably from the Epic Period, Indian concept of
Devaputra ‘god-son’ is linked with kings to give them divinity
and not as a title.<sup>104</sup> Aśoka could claim the title only of
{%‘Devānām priya’%}<sup>105</sup> meaning ‘the beloved of the gods’. Thus
{%Devaputra%} or ‘god-son’ was a superior title given to the Kuṣāṇas
by Indians. It is interesting to note that the epithet {%Devaputravat%}
has been used for Buddha in one of our inscriptions<sup>106</sup>
