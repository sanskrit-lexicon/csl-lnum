2. {%Hariṣeṇa%}¦ (No. 1, L. 32):
He is given several titles indicating offices held of a {%Khādya-%}
{%ṭapākika,<sup>58</sup>%} a {%Sāndhivigrahika,%} a {%Kumārāmātya%} and a {%Mahāda-%}
{%ṇḍanāyaka%} of Samudragupta. He is also the composer of this
inscription which has been termed as a {%kāvya.<sup>59</sup>%}
<div n="P"/>Hari is Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa and {%sena%} is to be obtained from
Sanskrit senā. The name can be explained in two ways.
That Hari is his personal name and ṣeṇa or sena his surname.
We may also explain it is, ‘one with Hari as his army’. The
Mahābhārata informs us that there was only big army on the side
of the Kauarvas and there was only Hari, i.e., Lord Kṛṣṇa on
the side of the Pāṇḍavas. The Pāṇḍavas could get Hari on
their side by foregoing the Yādava army to the Kauravas.
