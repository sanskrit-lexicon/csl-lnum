1. {%Bali%}¦ (No. 14, L. 2):
The reference to Bali comes in connection with the praise of
Lord Viṣṇu.<sup>57</sup> Literally meaning ‘one who is powerful or
vigorous’, Bali was the son of Virocana and the grandson of
Prahlāda and has been the king of the Asuras.<sup>58</sup> A famous
legend about him runs thus — The demon Bali, by his austeri-
ties acquired the dominion over the three worlds, and caused
annoyance and anxiety to the gods. Viṣṇu then reincarnated
himself as a dwarf, appeared before Bali, and asked for as
much land as he could cover with three strides. Bali assented
to his request, and Viṣṇu with two strides covered the heavens
and the earth, but, in commiseration for Bali, who then
humbled himself, left him the dominion over the lower
regions below the earth.<sup>59</sup> We get a reference to this legend
as early as in the Viṣṇusūkta of the Ṛgveda.<sup>60</sup>
