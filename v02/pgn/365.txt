 {%Pur or Pura%}¦
Pur is a word of frequent occurrence in the Ṛgveda.<sup>209</sup> The
early Vedic Āryans were not city builders. Puras<sup>210</sup> which are
mentioned from the context seem to have been always associ-
ated with the dasyus and the enemies of the Āryans.<sup>211</sup> Pura,
the oldest Sanskrit word denoting city, is usually derived from
the Dravidian {%ur.%} From what we read in the Ṛgveda about
Puraṃdara's exploits in connection with the destruction of
the ninety-nine puras of the Asuras who had been causing
havoc to the gods, these puras seem to refer to the cities of
the Indus Valley pre-Āryans.<sup>212</sup> But the word {%ur%} is not availa-
ble in Dravidian lexicons: on the contrary it is pura which is
mentioned by them.<sup>213</sup> The word {%ur%} is not to be traced in the
I. E. languages.<sup>214</sup> We find {%Ur%} only as the name of a town in
Babylonia.<sup>215</sup> In Tamil country, in the inscriptions of the
Chola dynasty (A.D. 900-1300) the word {%‘ur’%} is used to
refer to ‘The Primary Assembly of the villagers’ in the case of
ordinary villages while in the same context the word Sabhā is
used in case of Agrahāra villages, mostly tenanted by learned
brāhmaṇas.<sup>216</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the later Vedic literature<sup>217</sup> the word Pur meant ‘rampart’,
‘fort’, or ‘stronghold’. The meaning of Pura as ‘city’ developed
later and was not at all in vogue in the Vedic literature.
<div n="P"/>Lexicons define it as a place containing large buildings
surrounded by a ditch and extending not less than one Kośa in
length, if it extends for half that distance it is called a kheṭa;
if less than that, a karvaṭa or small market town, any smaller
cluster of houses is called a grāma or village.<sup>218</sup> The Sama-
[Page-225+ 39]
rāṅgaṇasūtradhāra describes puras as being of three kinds —
Big, middle and small which have different measurements for
their ditches, buildings, streets and road-ways.<sup>219</sup> The big one
possesses a circumference of four thousand arcs, the middle of
two thousand arcs and the small of one thousand arcs.<sup>220</sup>
T. Burrow derives pura from §pri to fill Piparti ‘fills’: pur ‘city’:
Lithuanian pilis (l becomes r).<sup>221</sup> We find the word being spelt
in two ways pur<sup>222</sup> and pura<sup>223</sup> Pur (city), from puru (much)
and pūrṇa (full) means ‘plentitude’ or multitude of settlers.
Similarly Greek polis (city) from poly (much): Latin populus
(population, people) from plenus (full), and English folk from
full. Pur is the city and puruṣa the citizen. Greek polites
(citizens), is preserved in politics (civic concerns), police (city
administration), and cosmopolitan (citizen of the world):
Lithuanian pilis (fort, castle).<sup>224</sup> In modern times the word
purā (from pura) is used for mohalla in India. It seems to be
the result of Muslim contact.<sup>225</sup>
<div n="P"/>Pura, where it does not retain the original from pur, is
changed into the following<sup>226</sup>:
<div n="HI"/>(a) Wār: as Purushapura, Peshawar; Nalapura, Narwar;
Matipura, Madwār; Śalwapura, Alwar; Candrapura,
Candwar.
<div n="P"/>(b) Urs or ur, as Māyāpura, Mayura; Siṃhapura, Siṅgur;
Juṣkapura, Zukur
<div n="P"/>(c) Or, as Traipura, Tcor; Candrādityapura, Caindor
<div n="P"/>(d) Ora, as Ilbalapura, Ellora
<div n="P"/>(e) Ore, as Lavapura, Lahore
<div n="P"/>(f) Ola, as Āryapura, Aihole
<div n="P"/>(g) ar, as Kusumapura, Kumrār
<div n="P"/>(h) aur, as Siddhapura, Siddhaur
<div n="P"/>(i) Own, as Hiraṇyapura, Hindoun or Herdoun
<div n="P"/>There are many names with the suffix Pura in the Aṣṭā-
dhyāyī, Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya and the Kāśikā.<sup>227</sup> The word
Mahāpura in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās<sup>228</sup> and the Brāhmaṇas<sup>229</sup>
denotes a great fortress. Probably the only difference between
the Pur and Mahāpura was in their size.<sup>230</sup>
