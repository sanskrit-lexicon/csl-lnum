 {%Pallī%}¦
The suffix — palli, pallī, pallaka or its diminutive pallikā is
derived from §pal to go, to move.<sup>442</sup> It means a small village,
(esp.) a settlement of wild tribes (e. g. Triśira-pallī = Trichin-
opoly).<sup>443</sup> Pallī has been used as meaning a den of thieves in
the Uttarādhyanasūtra and other Jain canonical texts,<sup>444</sup> the
earliest portions of which are assigned to about 300 B.C.<sup>445</sup>

<div n="P"/>The Samarāṅgaṇasūtradhāra by king Bhojadeva, an ele-
venth century work, defines Pallī thus:
<div n="P"/>“Where Pulindas<sup>446</sup> live building their huts with leafs,
branches and stones etc. is called Pallī and a small Pallī is
called Pallīkā”.<sup>447</sup>
<div n="P"/>Its derivation from §pal to go, to move, fits in very well as
it was an inhabitation of Ābhīras, thieves and barbarians who
moved from one place to another and were usually in small
number.
<div n="P"/>It seems to be a Dravidian word loaned in Sanskrit. We
find in Tamil, Malayalam and Kannada the word palli meaning
hamlet, settlement, small village and in Telugu the words Palli
and Palliya denoting ‘a small village’.<sup>448</sup>
<div n="P"/>Pallī<sup>449</sup> is changed into:
<div n="P"/>(a) bal: Āśāpallī, Yessabal
<div n="P"/>(b) Poli, as Triśirapallī (= Trishṇāpallī), Trichinopoly
<div n="P"/>(c) oli, as Ahalyapallī, Ahiroli (also Ahiāri).
<div n="P"/>We have only one place-name ending in this suffix, with
a slight variation which is ‘palla’ and is detailed below:
