14. {%Śuṅkaka%}¦ (No. 29, L. 4):
It is also an abbreviated name with the addition of suffix {%‘ka’.%}
The word should have been Śaṅkuka instead of Śuṅkaka.
The present form may be due to the mistake of the engraver.
The word Śuṅkaka is meaningless. Śaṅku is the name of Lord
Śiva. We have many names based on the word Śaṅku in lite-
rature. Śaṅkuka was the name of a poet (author of the
Bhuvanābhyudaya and son of Mayūra),<sup>66</sup> and also of a writer
on rhetoric.<sup>67</sup>
