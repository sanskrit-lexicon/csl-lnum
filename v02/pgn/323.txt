The epithet ‘Licchavi-dauhitra’ (daughter's son of the Licchavi)
for Samudragupta occurs in all these Gupta records It
suggests the importance of Candragupta I's marriage with the
Licchavi princess Kumāradevī. The alliance had no social
importance but it was important for political gain by virtue
of which Candragupta I (Samudragupta's father) gained power-
ful position in Magadha and the neighbouring countries. In
the Candragupta-Kumāradevī-coins, we have no mention of
the Guptas but only of the Licchavis in plural {%‘Licchavayaḥ’%}
(the Licchavis). This supports the amalgamation of the
Guptas with the Licchavis and we may agree with Majumdar
that ‘the epithet {%Licchavi dauhitra%} was deliberately given to
Samudragupta to emphasize his right of succession to the dual
monarchy’.<sup>195</sup>
<div n="P"/>We also know of a house of the Licchavis at Nepal<sup>196</sup> but
the separate reference to Nepal as a tributary province in the
Allahabad Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta<sup>197</sup> proves that it
was different from the Licchavi kingdom which Samudragupta
had inherited from his mother. The Licchavi kingdom of
[Page-139+ 39]
Kumāradevī may be located in North Bihar with Vaiśālī
(modern Basarh in Muzaffarpur district) as its centre.<sup>198</sup> It was
a credit for the astute diplomacy of Candragupta to marry the
Licchavi princess as we know, in ancient times, the Licchavis of
Vaiśālī had been the rivals of the kings of Pāṭaliputra<sup>199</sup> and
that they did not marry outside their area.<sup>200</sup>
<div n="P"/>The name of this powerful people has come to us in many
different readings:
<div n="P"/>Licchavi, Lecchavi, Lecchai, Lecchaki, Licchvi, Nicchivi,
<div n="P"/>Lichikki and Lichavi.
<div n="P"/>Of these the Licchavi has been most commonly used in
literature.<sup>201</sup>
<div n="P"/>The earliest mention of this people is in Kauṭilya's Artha-
śāstra,<sup>202</sup> where they are called Licchavis. Here we read that
the corporations of Licchivi, Vṛji, Malla, Madra, Kakura,
Kuru, Pañcāla and others were {%‘rājaśabdopajīvinaḥ’.%} It is note-
worthy that Kauṭilya distinguishes the Licchavis from the Vṛjis
though some scholars consider them to be one.<sup>203</sup> H. Pandey<sup>204</sup>
says that it appears from the Pali suttas that the names Vajji
and Licchavi are interchangeable to some extent. But the
accounts of Chinese pilgrims point to a different conclusion.
Fa-Hien describes the kingdom of Vaiśālī where ‘Licchavis’
were the people of the country. He does not mention Vṛji or
Vajji. Hiuen Tsang describes Vaiśālī and Vṛji as two distinct
countries, and Watters is inclined to doubt the accuracy of his
description of the Vṛji country.<sup>205</sup> But we know that Vajji was
a powerful confederacy of which the Videhas along with the
Licchavis, Jñātrikas, Ugras, Bhojas and others were the cons-
tituent confederate clans (aṭṭhakula). Of these the Licchavis and
the Videhas were the most important, and the Licchavi Capital
Vaiśālī was the head-quarter of the confederacy.<sup>206</sup> But Ray
Chaudhuri observes: “Vajji was not only the name of the
confederacy but also of one of the constituent clans. But the
Vajjis like the Licchavis are sometimes associated with the
city of Vaiśālī which was not only the capital of the Licchavi
clan, but also the metropolis of the entire confederacy”.<sup>207</sup> The
Licchavi republic was generally called the saṃgha or gaṇa of
the Vajjis. The Licchavis would not possibly have allowed this
name, had they not themselves been Vajjians. In one passage,
[Page-140+ 39]
the Licchavi Mahānāma, seeing that a band of young Licchavis
who had been out hunting were gathered round the Buddha, is
represented as saying, “They (i. e. the Licchavis) will become
Vajjians, they will become Vajjians ({%bhavissanti Vajji bhavis-%}
{%santi Vajji)%}”! This possibly only means that there was great
hope of these Licchavi young men becoming true Vajjians,
practising the seven conditions of welfare taught by the
Buddha, conditions which endured their prosperity, and lead-
ing a more cultured life. Thus the Vajji appears to be a more
dignified term. It might have originally been given to the tribe
which inhabited what is known as {%Vajjiraṭṭha (Vṛji-rāṣṭra),%} i. e.,
the Vajjian country, in Buddhist literature. Later a separation
seems to have taken place among the Vajjis and Licchavis,
because the Arthaśāstra (XI. I) mentions the Licchavika and
the Vṛjika as two distinct republics.<sup>208</sup>
<div n="P"/>The clan of the Licchavis figures very prominently in the
annals of early Buddhism. Buddhaghoṣa, the celebrated Pali
commentator has the following story<sup>209</sup>: The chief queen of
the king of Benaras, at the time of her child-birth delivered
lump of flesh, ‘of the colour of lac and of bandhu and Jīvaka
flowers’. Fearing the displeasure of the king if he should hear
of this, the other queens put the lump of flesh into a casket
marked with royal seal and placed it on the flowing waters of
the Ganges. The casket was discovered by an ascetic, and
taken by him to his hermitage, where he cared for the lump of
flesh. After the lapse of some time, tha lump broke up into
two pieces of flesh, which gradually assumed shape, till finally
one of them became a boy resplendent like gold, and the other a
girl. Whatever entered the stomach of these two infants looked
as if put into a vessel of precious transparent stone {%(maṇi)%}
so that they seemed to have no skin {%(Nicchavi).%} Others said: ‘the
two were attached to each other by their skin {%(līna-chavi)%} as if
they had been sewn together’; so that these infants came to be
designated ‘Licchavis’. We are further told that on coming of
age the boy and the girl were married to each other and from
this brother and sister union sprang the race of the Licchavis<sup>210</sup>
<div n="P"/>The origin of the Licchavis has been a matter of great
controversy. They have been represented as Scythians, Kolari-
ans, Tibetans and Persians by different authorities.<sup>211</sup>
[Page-141+ 39]
<div n="P"/>Samuel Beal<sup>212</sup> takes the Licchavis or Vajjis to be a
branch of the ‘Yue-Chi’ forgetting that the latter came to India
in the first century B.C. while the Licchavis were a highly
civilized and prosperous people in the sixth century B.C.
<div n="P"/>In the opinion of J.P. Hewitt, there are “very strong
indications that the Vajjians, who were certainly the earliest
settlers in the country, were of Kolarian race who had lived
there long before the arrival of the Dravidians and Āryans”.
The learned writer ignores the existence of the pre-Vajjian
Āryan dynasty of rulers at Vaiśālī.<sup>213</sup>
<div n="P"/>V.A. Smith<sup>214</sup> found similarities between the customs of
the Tibetans and those of the Licchavis in the practice of the
exposure of the dead and also in judicial procedure. And
hence he came to the conclusion that the Licchavis, the
ruling tribe or clan in Vṛji country of which Vaiśālī was the
capital, was really a Tibetan (or Mongolian) tribe which settled
in the plains during the prehistoric times. The view has been
criticised by B.C. Law, K.P. Jayaswal, H.C. Raychaudhuri
and others on the following grounds<sup>215</sup>:
<div n="HI"/>(1) The custom of the disposal of the dead was prevalent
among the Vedic Āryans from whom the Licchavis
were descended;
<div n="HI"/>(2) In the case of Tibet we have only three courts as
against the seven tribunals of the Licchavis; further
we know very little about the relative antiquity of the
Tibetan procedure which might very well have been
suggested by the system expounded in the Aṭṭhakathā.
<div n="P"/>S.C. Vidyābhūṣaṇa<sup>216</sup> suggests a Persian origin for the
Licchavis holding that the name Licchavi ({%Nicchavi%} of Manu,
X. 22) was derived from the Persian city of {%Nisibis.%} There
is very little in Vidyābhūṣaṇa's surmise except a fancied
resemblance between the names Nicchivi and Nisibis. Inscrip-
tions of the Achaemenids are silent about any Persian settle-
ment in the Eastern India in the sixth or fifth century B.C. The
Licchavi people were more interested in {%Yakṣa caityas%} and the
teaching of Mahāvīra and the Buddha than in the deities and
Prophets of Iran.<sup>217</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Licchavis have been invariably represented as kṣatriyas
in ancient Indian literature. As the Mahāparinibbāṇa-Sutta
[Page-142+ 39]
informs us, they claimed a share of the remnants of the
Buddha's body on the ground that they were kṣatriyas like the
Buddha himself: “The Exalted one was a kṣatriya and so are
we. We are worthy to receive a portion of relies of the Exalted
one”. We get many other similar instances.<sup>218</sup> We find that
both the Śākyas (to whose race the Buddha belonged) and the
Licchavis are described as progenies of brother and sister
unions. Like the Śākyas, the Licchavis are also described as
kṣatriyas.<sup>219</sup> Manu speaks of the Licchavis as kṣatriyas, though
of the Vrātya variety.<sup>220</sup> Regarding the Vrātyas, Manu says:
‘Those (sons) whom the twice-born have by the wives of equal
caste, but who, not fulfilling their scared duties, are excluded
from the initiation to {%Sāvitrī,%} one must designate by the appel-
lation vrātyas’.<sup>221</sup>
<div n="P"/>We know that Mahāvīra, the founder of Jainism, was the
very kin of the Licchavis and that he had many followers
among the residents of Vaiśālī, even among the highest officers.
Then again, between the sixth century B.C. and 200 B.C., the
earliest estimated date of the Manusmṛti,<sup>222</sup> the Licchavis had
won the good graces of the Buddha as well as of the followers
of the religion he preached. During this long interval, when the
two great ‘heretic’ faiths flourished in their country, the
Licchavis might not have been particular to the ceremonies and
practices that the regulations of the orthodox brāhmaṇas
required. ‘Hence we can understand how Manu, the great
brāhmaṇa law-giver came to refer to the Licchavis as
Vrātyas’.<sup>223</sup> But Gokhale<sup>224</sup> takes the term kṣatriya in this
context to mean representative of political power rather than
a specific caste in the brahminical hierarchy and from the word
{%Vrātya%} infers that they were outside the pale of the brahminical
civilization.
<div n="P"/>Scholars have divergent views about the connotation of the
word ‘Vrātya’.<sup>225</sup> Charpentier described the Vrātyas, as a band
of people not governed by the rules of caste, probably repre-
senting the worst elements of Indian society, — the thief, the
robber, the drunken one, etc. But Keith rejected this view by
pointing out that Manu's reference to the {%Rājanya Vrātyas,%}
e. g. Licchavis and Mallas (X. 22) has no value for Vedic
times.<sup>226</sup> Haver in his article ‘Der Vrātya’ derives ‘Vrātya’
[Page-143+ 39]
from {%‘vrata’.%} Thus the oldest meaning of ‘Vrāta’ is a group of
people bound by holy ceremonies, bound by a vow to cult-
actions being derived from {%‘vrata’%} which is a vow taken in the
service of a god. The {%Vrātīnas,%} on the other hand, ‘were
Aryans of a more primitive culture and religion, than the
orthodox brāhmaṇas, and were organised in cult-unions and
both {%‘vrātya’%} and {%‘vrātīna’%} being derived from {%‘vrata’%} are
‘members of the same holy union’. The only difference between
them apparently was that the Vrātīna went to the brāhmaṇa
countries to perform the Vrātya-work and were paid for it,
while the Vrātyas acted in their own homeland.<sup>227</sup>
<div n="P"/>From all these considerations, we can see that the views of
Manu and the suggestion of B.C. Law are more tenable. In
the Nepāla Vaṃśāvalī, the Licchavis are allotted to the Sūrya-
vaṃśa or solar race of the kṣatriyas.<sup>228</sup> This is quite in agree-
ment with the fact elicited from the Buddhist records that they
were Vāsiṣṭhas by {%Gotra,%} for we know from the Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa<sup>229</sup> that the {%gotra%} or {%pravara%} (family) of a kṣatriya is
the same as that of his {%purohita%} or family-priest. The Vasiṣṭha
{%gotra%} was, therefore, the {%gotra%} of their family priest, and we
know that the Vasiṣṭhas were the family priests of the kings of
the solar race, especially of the Ikṣvākus.<sup>230</sup>
