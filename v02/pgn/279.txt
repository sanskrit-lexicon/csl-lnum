3. {%Bhaṭṭibhava%}¦ (No. 31, L. 2):
[Page-092+ 39]
The image on which the Mathurā Jaina Inscription of Kumāra-
gupta I, of G. E. 113 is inscribed was set up by Śāmāḍhyā (Śyāmā-
ḍhyā), the daughter of Bhaṭṭibhava. Bhaṭṭibhava seems to have
been a brāhmaṇa-follower of Jainism. Bhaṭṭa or Bhaṭṭi, a surname
meaning ‘a teacher’ has been put here before Bhava. Bhaṭṭi is
the Prakritised form of Sanskrit ‘Bharti’ meaning a lord or
master which came to be accepted as a Sanskrit word. ‘Bhava’
means ‘a god, deity’ and is also the name of Lord Śiva.
Bhava also means ‘prosperity, welfare’.<sup>30</sup> Thus the full name
literally means ‘one who is a (source of) prosperity, for his
teacher’. It can also be a case of a name after the deity ‘Bhava’
or ‘Śiva’.
