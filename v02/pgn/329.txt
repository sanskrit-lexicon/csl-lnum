16. {%Puṣyamitras%}¦ (No. 13, L. 11):
The Bhitari Stone Pillar Inscription<sup>397</sup> records Skandagupta's
victory over a powerful enemy called the Puṣyamitras, who
possessed a strong army and a rich treasury: he (Skandagupta)
placed (his) left foot on a foot-stool which was the king (of
that tribe himself).<sup>398</sup> H.R. Divekar suggested the reading
{%Yudhy-amitrān%} in place of {%Puṣyamitrān.%} But, as pointed out by
R.D. Banerji,<sup>399</sup> the proposed reading is impossible.
<div n="P"/>There are several views about the identification of the
Puṣyamitras.
<div n="HI"/>(i) Fleet identified them with the people mentioned in the
Purāṇas as {%Paṭumitras%} and located them on the
Narmadā.<sup>400</sup>
<div n="HI"/>(ii) V.A. Smith<sup>401</sup> regarded them as a people of the North.
<div n="HI"/>(iii) Hoernle believed that they were the same as the
{%Maitrakas.%}<sup>402</sup>
<div n="HI"/>(iv) R.D. Banerji<sup>403</sup> regarded them as the first wave of the
Hūṇas.
<div n="HI"/>(v) N.K. Bhattasali has suggested that the Puṣyamitras
were the descendants of king Puṣyavarmā of Assam.<sup>404</sup>
<div n="P"/>Bhattasali says that a pun (śleṣa) has been used for “the
descendants of Puṣyavarman of Assam who had so long been
{%mitras%} or friends of the Guptas, but had change into foes by
their desire for conquest and had invaded the Gupta empire from
the east and made it totter”. But as remarked by D.C. Sircar,
“there is no grammatical, lexicographical, or literary support,
for this interpretation of the name Puṣyamitra”.<sup>405</sup>
<div n="P"/>Bhattasali opines that Mahendravarman, whom he assigns
to the period A.D. 450 to 490 who performed two horse-sacri-
fices must have been powerful enough to launch an attack on
the Gupta empire in the reign of Skandagupta.
[Page-156+ 39]
<div n="P"/>We know that the definite limits of Skandagupta's reign
are from A.D. 455 to 467. The period of the rule of
Mahendravarman, however, cannot be so definitely fixed because
we do not possess any dated records of his reign. As a matter
of fact the entire chronology of the kings of Assam can be
settled approximately only by means of synchronisms and rough
calculations. The attack on the Gupta empire by the Varmans
of Assam in the reign of Skandagupta is an impossibility.<sup>406</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Puṣyamitras cannot be a branch of the Hūṇas as held by
R.D. Banerji. The Hūṇas have been mentioned separately in
the Bhitari Inscription.<sup>407</sup> “By whose (Skandagupta's) two
arms the earth was shaken, when he, the creator (of a distur-
bance like that) of a terrible whirlpool, joined in close conflict
with the Hūṇas”. Hoernle's view that “the Puṣyamitras were the
same as Maitrakas who some years later under the leadership
of Bhaṭārka established themselves in Valabhī probably with
the help of the Hūṇa ruler Toramāṇa”;<sup>408</sup> is also not accept-
able as the Maitrakas remained subservient to the Imperial
Guptas from the time of Bhaṭārka to that of Droṇasiṃha.<sup>409</sup>
Therefore, they cannot be the same as Puṣyamitras who rebelled
against Skandagupta.
<div n="P"/>The Purāṇas mention a people called Puṣyamitras, whose
rule commenced after the end of the dynasty of the {%Vindhyakas.%}
In the Viṣṇupurāṇa MSS. consulted by Prof. Wilson we have
the following statement: “and Puṣpamitras, and Paṭumitras
and others to the number of thirteen will rule over Mekalā”.<sup>410</sup>
Prof. Wilson has added the following note, “It seems most
correct to separate the thirteen sons or families of the Vindhya
princes from these Bāhlikas and then from the Puṣyamitras and
Paṭumitras who governed Mekalā, a country on the Nar-
madā”.<sup>411</sup>
<div n="P"/>A similar statement is to be found in the Vāyupurāṇa,
according to which ‘the Puṣyamitras and Paṭumitras are
grouped with the rulers of Mekalā, whose seven kings have not
been named.<sup>412</sup>
<div n="P"/>The mention of {%Vindhyakas,%} evidently a people of the
Vindhya region, and of Mekalā, points to the south rather than
to North. So the view of V.A. Smith that the Puṣyamitras were
a people of the North is not acceptable.
[Page-157+ 39]
<div n="P"/>Thus the view of Fleet that the Puṣyamitras are to be placed
in Central India somewhere in the country along the banks of
the Narmadā, seems to be most reasonable.<sup>413</sup> This is supported
by numismatic evidence, a hoard of coins brought to light by
D.B. Diskalkar,<sup>414</sup> from the village of Bamnala, 24 miles to
the south of the Narmadā, indicates that there was a serious
disturbance of peace in the vicinity of Mekalā, in the middle
of the fifth century A.D. and we may connect it with the rising
of the Puṣyamitras in that region.<sup>415</sup>
