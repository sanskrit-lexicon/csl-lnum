18. {%Vaṭodaka<sup>435</sup>%}¦ (No. 30, L. 4):
It is the name of a village. Vaṭa is probably a Prakritic form of
vṛtta meaning ‘surrounded or covered’<sup>436</sup> and the word udaka
means ‘water’. So the whole will literally mean ‘a place sur-
rounded by water’. It has been mentioned in the inscription as
the abode of good people where lived a person, who bore the
distinguished appellation Śrīdeva.<sup>437</sup>
<div n="P"/>Vaṭodaka has been identified with Badoh which is a small
village in the Bhilsa district of the old Gwalior State, now in
Madhya Pradesh.<sup>438</sup>
