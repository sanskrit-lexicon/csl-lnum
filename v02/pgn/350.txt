 {%Maṇḍala%}¦
Maṇḍala is a territorial unit which is found in the inscriptions
of many dynasties of the early medieval period. Originally it
denoted in the Arthaśāstra and other legal texts,<sup>154</sup> a diploma-
tic circle of twelve neighbouring kings, some friendly and
others unfriendly, in relation to a king desirous of conquest.
The term could also be used for the territory under the posse-
ssion of a feudatory. But in the Gupta period maṇḍala is used
for some kind of administrative division though in early medie-
val period its use was in feudalistic association.<sup>155</sup> In Cālukyan
records, the governor of a maṇḍala was usually called a Maṇḍ-
aleśvara or Mahāmaṇḍaleśvara.<sup>156</sup> In the records of the Impe-
rial Guptas it denoted a unit smaller than a Vīthī.<sup>157</sup> Literally
meaning a circle or round it denotes a district, province, coun-
try in general or it may signify a surrounding district or neigh-
bouring state.<sup>158</sup>
