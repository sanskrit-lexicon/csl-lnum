4. {%Himaśarmman%}¦ (No. 43, L. 9):
Hima<sup>39</sup> means snow or winter. G. Bühler<sup>40</sup> takes the mean-
ing of {%hima%} as ‘the moon’. So we can say that the name is
based on the deity moon. The word Śarman signifies only
a surname. It has got no meaning as the part of the name.
Or we may say that the name is based on the winter
season.<sup>41</sup>
