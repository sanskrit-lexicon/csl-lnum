23. {%Yaudheya%}¦ (No. 1, L. 22):
The Yaudheyas are included among the tribes subjugated by
Samudragupta. In his time, they seem to have occupied north-
ern Rajputana and south-east Punjab, and their territory
extended up to the confines of the Bahawalpur State where
their name survives in the name of the tract called Johiyawar.<sup>581</sup>
Their earliest reference in the inscriptions is found in the
Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription of Rudradāman I (A.D. 150)<sup>582</sup>
which mentions the victory of Mahākṣatrapa Rudradāman over
the Yaudheyas who were ‘proud of their heroism’. The Bijaya-
gadh Inscription<sup>583</sup> which is a record of the Yaudheyas (in
Brāhmī characters of the second-third century A.D.)<sup>584</sup> connects
them with Bharatpur State in Rajputana. It refers to one
Mahārāja Mahāsenāpati, the ruler of the Yaudheya-gaṇa.<sup>585</sup>
<div n="P"/>Literally the word {%Yaudheya%} means ‘a warrior’ which corr-
esponds with the {%Ossadü%} of Arrian, the {%Sambastae%} of Diodorus
and the {%Sambracae%} of Curtius, who made their submission to
Alexander.<sup>586</sup> They were a powerful nation and their forces
consisted of 60,000 foot, 6000 horse, and 500 chariots.<sup>587</sup>
<div n="P"/>We get three different versions about the origin of the
Yaudheyas:
<div n="HI"/>(i) In the Mahābhārata<sup>588</sup> it is stated that Yudhiṣṭhira
married the daughter of the Śaivya King Govāsana
named Devikā and begot a son from her named
Yaudheya.
Buddha Prakash<sup>589</sup> and M.K. Sharan,<sup>590</sup> on this basis,
have been tempted to connect the Yaudheyas with
Yudhiṣṭhira, the eldest of the Pāṇḍava brothers. D.K.
Gupta questions the foundations of this theory on this
solitary basis in the absence of a more solid or a posi-
tive evidence;<sup>591</sup> but on the other hand he himself has
indulged in connecting the Ārjunāyanas with the epic
hero Arjuna.<sup>592</sup>
<div n="P"/>(ii) The Viṣṇu-Purāṇa gives a contrary view of the same
story. It states that {%Yaudheyī%} was the queen of Yudhi-
ṣṭhira from whom he had a son named Devaka<sup>593</sup>
[Page-172+ 39]
<div n="HI"/>(iii) The Harivaṃśa<sup>594</sup> and the Vāyu Purāṇa<sup>595</sup> state that
King Uśīnara of the Puru dynasty had five queens
named Nṛgā or Mṛgā, Kṛmī, Navā, Darvā and Dṛṣad-
vatī who gave birth to five sons named Nṛga, (or Mṛga),
Kṛmi, Nava, Suvrata and Śibi (or Śivi) respectively.
Śibi was the lord of the Śibi people or of the city of
Śivapura, while Nṛga (or Mṛga) was the ruler of the
Yodheyas or of Yaudheyapura. The other three sons
of Uśīnara, viz., Nava, Kṛmi and Suvrata, were the
lords respectively of Navarāṣṭra, Kṛmilāpurī and Amba-
ṣṭhapurī.<sup>596</sup> According to Pargiter, King Uśinara
established the Yaudheyas, Ambaṣṭhas, Navarāṣṭra, and
the city of Kṛmilā, all on the eastern border of the
Punjab; while his famous son Śivi Auśīnara originated
the Śivis or Śrbis in Sivapura.<sup>597</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is very difficult to reject or accept the Puranic tradition
without any further evidence. However, as regards their conne-
ction with Uśīnara, we may say that scholars are somewhat
confused by differing versions by varied text with regard to the
territory ruled over by him.<sup>598</sup> The Ṛgveda, the Jātakas as
well as the accounts of Fahien and Hiuen Tsang connect the
Uśīnaras with a region farther to the north-west in Swat Valley,
a part of the ancient Mahājanapada of Gandhāra; while the
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, the Kauśītakī Upaniṣad and the Kathāsa-
ritsāgara associate them to the region north of Haridwar near
the source of Ganges at Kanakhala.
<div n="P"/>It is possible that originally they were settled in the Swat
Valley but by the passage of time, they migrated to other places
as well. For example, we find that the Śibis were known to
Alexander's followers, living between the Indus and the
Akesines (Chenab).<sup>599</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Mahābhārata,<sup>600</sup> the Yaudheyas are described as
having been defeated by Arjuna, along with the Mālavas and
Trigarttas. In the Sabhāparvan,<sup>601</sup> the Yaudheyas together
with the Śibis and the Trigarttas are represented as having
paid homage to Yudhiṣṭhira. In the Droṇaparvan,<sup>602</sup> we find
that an epithet {%‘Adrija’%} meaning ‘mountain-born’, is used for
the Yaudheyas.
<div n="P"/>The Yaudheyas were one of the republican tribes of the
[Page-173+ 39]
Punjab. Pāṇini<sup>603</sup> includes them among the {%āyudhajīvī saṃghas%}
together with the Parśus who are considered to be Persians
by Dr. Buddha Prakash.<sup>604</sup> Pāṇini mentions the Yaudheyas in
another Sūtra also.<sup>605</sup> Kauṭilya also refers to the Yaudheya as
a warrior clan of the Punjab.<sup>606</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Bṛhatsaṃhitā<sup>607</sup> places them in the northern division of
India and describes them as being in the region of Bṛhaspati.<sup>608</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Sāhityadarpaṇa of Viśvanātha, they are described as
interested in gambling ({%dīvyatām%}) and speaking the Southern
Vaidarbhī.<sup>609</sup>
<div n="P"/>Yaudheya coins have been found all over the area from
Saharanpur to Multan. In the Ludhiana district have been
unearthed their votive tablets. A rich find of their coin-moulds
was brought to light by B. Sahni at Khokrakot near Rohtak
where there seems to have existed a regular mint.<sup>610</sup> Their
new currency<sup>611</sup> depicting their tutelary deity Kārttikeya which
replaced the Kuṣāṇa currency in these regions, shows that
they played a leading part in the extermination of Śaka rule
in India.<sup>612</sup> The findings of the Yaudheya coins in large num-
ber at Saharanpur, Dehradoon, Delhi, Rohtak and Kangra
attest the fact that they had driven out the Kuṣāṇas from these
areas and had re-established themselves firmly, in the 3rd-4th
century A.D.<sup>613</sup>
<div n="P"/>One of their seals, bearing the legend {%“Yaudheyānām jayam-%}
{%antradharāṇām”%}<sup>614</sup> shows that they were held in high esteem
among the warrior-clans of the Punjab. Some scholars seem
to be confused about its interpretation. Shobha Mukerji<sup>615</sup>
opines that their coins were issued in the name of the gaṇa as
well as the Mantra-dharas. M.K. Sharan<sup>616</sup> explains the word
{%“Mantradhara”%} to mean the members of the Executive Com-
mittee “those vested with the policy of the state”. He is of the
opinion that one set of the Yaudheya coins is struck in the
name of the {%“Mantradharas”%} and the {%“Gaṇa”,%} while the other
set is struck simply in the name of Gaṇa.<sup>617</sup> He seems to have
wrongly substituted the reading {%“Mantradhāra”%} for {%“Mantra-%}
{%dhara”.%} He has been arbitrary in separating {%“Jaya”%} from
{%Mantradharāṇām%}”<sup>618</sup> which forms a compound by the combi-
nation of the two words. Further he rejects the view of some
historians who consider the word {%“Mantradharāṇām”%} to mean
[Page-174+ 39]
‘those who were in possession of Victory Charm’. But he
contradicts himself at another place while explaining a seal<sup>619</sup>
found at Naurangabad with the remarks: “This seal indicates
the bravery of the tribe and that they were never defeated as
they had adopted the title of {#‘jayamantraDarAH’#}”.
<div n="P"/>Actually the expression may mean ‘the Yaudheyas who
knew the secret of victory’. It is symbolic of their victory and
pride that they never got defeated.
<div n="P"/>Another word which has raised some controversy among
the scholars is {%“Darma”%} found on some of the Yaudheya coins.
Some scholars take it to mean Dharma while others take it for
{%‘Dama’%} or {%‘Darma’%} to be a Sanskritised form of Greek —
{%“Drachma”.%}<sup>620</sup> Again some controversy arose whether it was
a Copper one or of silver.<sup>621</sup> The word {%‘Damma’%} or {%‘Dramma’%}
has been used for a gold coin.<sup>622</sup> It may be remarked that the
word borrowed from some foreign language may not strictly
be used in the original sense and hence it may simply mean
coin.<sup>623</sup> The Kuṣāṇas had introduced gold-coins which were
later on adopted by the Guptas. But the Yaudheyas seem to
have never adopted the gold currency since so far we have found
no gold coin belonging to them. This may speak of their weaker
economic condition; surely they could not compare with
powerful monarchies. On some of the Yaudheya coins, we have
the mysterious words, {%“dvi”%} (two) and {%“tri”%} (three) after the
legend {%“Yaudheyagaṇasya jayaḥ”%} which may point out their
making a confederation with other tribes, viz., the Ārjunāyanas
and the Kuṇindas.<sup>624</sup> They seem to have controlled the area
lying on the banks of the river Sutlej up to the borders of the
Bahawalpur State which is still called Johiyawar. The word
{%‘Johiya’%} is apparently an abbreviation of {%‘Jodhiya’,%} which is the
Sanskrit Yaudheya.<sup>625</sup> Cunningham, however, takes the words
{%‘dvi’%} and {%‘tri’%} of the above-mentioned coins to signify ‘the
money of the second and third tribes of the Yaudheyas’.<sup>626</sup>
<div n="P"/>M.K. Sharan<sup>627</sup> has enlisted about twenty-four types and
Symbols on the coins of the Yaudheyas which may point to
their religious leanings as well bear out some aspects of their
social life. They are as follows:
<div n="P"/>1. Bull
<div n="P"/>2. Elephant
[Page-175+ 24]
<div n="P"/>3. Deer
<div n="P"/>4. Peacock
<div n="P"/>5. Tree-in-railing
<div n="P"/>6. Human figure standing (warrior)
<div n="P"/>7. Lakṣmī
<div n="P"/>8. Cobra
<div n="P"/>9. Scythic-like object (Yūpa)
<div n="P"/>10. Stūpa
<div n="P"/>11. Triśūla
<div n="P"/>12. Nandipada
<div n="P"/>13. Shell
<div n="P"/>14. Svastika
<div n="P"/>15. Vase or Maṅgala Kalaśa
<div n="P"/>16. Tribal sign or Ujjayinī Symbol
<div n="HI"/>17. Two {%‘s’%} with a line in between probably representing
two hooded snakes
<div n="P"/>18. Triangular-headed symbol or more probably a Yūpa
<div n="P"/>19. Zig-Zag line depicting snake or river
<div n="P"/>20. Circles with dots around, probably representing the sun
<div n="HI"/>21. Curved object within railing, probably a representation
of the Yūpa
<div n="P"/>22. Hill so-called Caitya
<div n="P"/>23. Six-headed Ṣaṣṭhī or Kṛttikā<sup>628</sup>
<div n="P"/>24. Śiva.
