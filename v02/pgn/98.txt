1. {%Dhṛtimitra%}¦ (No. 34, L. 5; No. 35, L. 5):
It is a name based on virtue, the first part being Dhṛti ‘per-
severance’ and the second part {%‘mitra’%} friend, the whole mean-
ing ‘one who is friendly to perseverance’, i.e., a man full of
perseverance. Names ending in {%mitra<sup>8</sup>%} are very few in the
Vedic literature but seem to have been very popular in the
post-Pāṇinian period. Coins<sup>9</sup> as well as the epigraphic records
show an abundant use of {%mitra-%} ending names.<sup>10</sup>
