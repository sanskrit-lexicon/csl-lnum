3. {%Kāmarūpa%}¦ (No. I, L. 22):
It has been mentioned as one of the frontier states which were
subordinate to Samudragupta and whose emperors paid him
[Page-254+ 39]
taxes and all kinds of obeisance. Majumdar<sup>539</sup> identifies it with
Upper Assam. Kāmarūpa consisted of the Western districts of
the Brahmaputra valley which being the most powerful state
and being the first to be approached from the western side
came to denote the whole valley.<sup>540</sup> The area of Kāmarūpa
was estimated by the Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsang to have
been 10,000 li i. e. 1667 miles in circuit which shows that it
must have comprised the whole valley of Brahmaputra.<sup>541</sup>
Śaktisaṅgama describes<sup>542</sup> Kāmarūpa as extending from Kāle-
śvara to the Śvetagiri and from Tripura to the Nīla-parvata
(which is the Nilādri or Nīlakūṭa, the name of the Kāmākhyā
hill). According to the Yoginī Tantra, the kingdom of Kāma-
rūpa included the whole of the Brahmaputra valley together
with Rangpur and Cochbihar.<sup>543</sup> The Purāṇas mention Prāg-
jyotiṣa, identified with Kāmākhyā or Gauhati, as the capital of
Kāmarūpa.<sup>544</sup> The Kamauli grant of Vaidyadeva mentions
Kāmarūpa as a Maṇḍala of the Prāgjyotiṣa-bhukti.<sup>545</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Abhidhāna, the Vaijayantī and the Trikāṇḍaśeṣa in-
form us that Prāgjyotiṣa and Kāmarūpa were the same coun-
try.<sup>546</sup> In the Raghuvaṃśa,<sup>547</sup> the separate mention of Prāg-
jyotiṣa and Kāmarūpa may seem to be a little puzzling. But
we see that whereas verses 81-82 of the fourth canto refer to
the king of Prāgjyotiṣa as terrified, the subsequent verses
describe the presentation of elephants and the offer of respects
by the king of Kāmarūpa to Raghu. Thus all the four verses
are inter-linked and, the context also proves that Prāgjyotiṣa
and Kāmarūpa were the same.<sup>548</sup> The Buddhist Chronicle
Ārya-mañjuśrī-mūlakalpa describes Kāmarūpa as a country of
the east.<sup>549</sup> The Bṛhatsaṃhitā<sup>550</sup> and the Kāvyamīmāṃsā<sup>551</sup>
also mention it in the same direction. Chatterji remarks that
the tribes living on the frontiers of Kāmarūpa were akin to the
Man tribes of South-Western China, a wild Tibeto-Chinese
people.<sup>552</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Ahoms of the Shan Tribe came into Assam at the be-
ginning of the 13th century due to the break-up of the Chinese
empire by the Moguls and ruled till the British occupation in
the beginning of the 19th century.<sup>553</sup>
