6. {%Trivṛtā%}¦ (No. 44, L. 2, L. 8, L. 15):
In L. 2, two localities named Trivṛtā and Śrīgohālī have been
[Page-263+ 37]
mentioned as connected with the village named Vāyigrāma.<sup>676</sup>
Literally it means ‘surrounded or covered by three sides’. It
seems that when the locality was founded the city was surroun-
ded by some natural boundary on its three sides. This may
have been in the form of rivulets or streams or hillocks.
