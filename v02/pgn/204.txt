5. {%Kaivarttaśarman%}¦ (No 43, L. 9):
The word Kaivartta means ‘a fisherman (born of a prosti-
tute by a kṣatriya or of an {%Ayogava%} female by a Niṣāda
father).<sup>42</sup> We also come across a name ‘Kaivartti-Śreṣṭhin’ in
No. 46, L. II. The name Kaivarttaśarmman may signify the
profession of the person who was by birth a brāhmaṇa. The
word Śarman here yields no meaning when combined with the
first part; it is only significant of a brāhmaṇa surname.
