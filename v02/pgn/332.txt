19. {%Saiṃhalaka%}¦ (No. 1, L. 23):
Inhabitants of Siṃhala or Ceylon. They are mentioned along
with the Daivaputras, Ṣāhis, Ṣāhānuṣāhis, Śakas and Muruṇḍas,
and all (other) dwellers in islands (probably the islands of
Southern Sea such as Jāvā and Sumātrā)<sup>434</sup> who paid homage
to Samudragupta by offering themselves for services, bringing
presents of maidens, praying for charters bearing the imperial
Gupta Garuḍa seal ({%Garutmadaṅka%}) by which they would be
left undisturbed by the emperor in the enjoyment ({%bhukti%}) and
administration ({%śāsana%}) of their respective territories.<sup>435</sup> If
literally interpreted the inscription will suggest that the people
mentioned here were really tributaries under Samudragupta.
[Page-159+ 40]
When we see from the inscription itself that the Tamil states
were left undisturbed, the inclusion of even distant Siṃhala
(Ceylon) and all other islands in this category raises great
doubts about this interpretation, and we shall hardly be justi-
fied in taking the words of the Court-poet in their literal sense
without corroborative evidence.<sup>436</sup> But the question arises that
was the conquest of Tāmraparṇī (Siṃhala) by Aśoka in his
Rock Edict II also a simple boast of this kind?<sup>437</sup>
<div n="P"/>So far as Ceylon is concerned, we have fortunately an
independent evidence of its political relation with Samuda-
gupta.
<div n="P"/>We know that after the death of king Mahāsena (A.D. 334 — 62)
of the Lambakarṇa clan his son Sumeghavarṇa ({%chi-mi-kia-%}
{%po-mo%} = “cloud of merit”) became king of Ceylon who was a
contemporary of Samudragupta ({%San-meou-to-lo-kin-to%}).<sup>438</sup> He,
according to a Chinese text, sent two monks to Bodh-Gayā to
visit the sacred spots, but they were put to great inconvenience
for want of suitable accommodation. To remove this difficulty
for future pilgrims to the holy place, Meghavarṇa decided to
found a monastery there. He accordingly sent a mission to
Samudragupta with rich presents and asked for permission,
and the Ceylonese king built a splendid monastery to the north
of the Bodhi tree.<sup>439</sup>
<div n="P"/>By the time of Hiuen Tsang it had developed into a magni-
ficant establishment, with more than 1,000 priests, and the
pilgrim has described the rich decorations and massive grand-
eur of the buildings. Referring to the old history of its
foundation Hiuen Tsang says that the Ceylonese king ‘gave in
tribute to the king of India all the jewels of his country’. “It
is likely that Samudragupta's courtier also regarded the rich
presents as a tribute, and construed the Ceylonese king's
prayer for permission to build a monastery into an ‘application
for charter confirming him in the enjoyment of his territories’,
one of the forms of homage paid by the category of states into
which Siṃhala is included”.<sup>440</sup>
<div n="P"/>Siṃhala is generally identified with Laṅkā. But Varāhami-
hira<sup>441</sup> mentions both of them separately as situated in the
South.
<div n="P"/>Laṅkā has been identified differently by various scholars
with Laṅkā of Madhyadeśa,<sup>442</sup> with Maldives,<sup>443</sup> with the
[Page-160+ 39]
northern part of the Andhra country on the shores of the Bay
of Bengal,<sup>444</sup> and with an island off the south-east Coast of Cey-
lon.<sup>445</sup> All these theories are refuted by S.B. Chaudhuri<sup>446</sup> who
remarks that the assumption that Laṅkā is not Ceylon is gra-
tuitous.<sup>447</sup> He points out that in the Rāmāyaṇa Rāvaṇa while
entreating Sītā to be his wife says: {%“Laṅkānāma samudrasya%}
{%madhye mama mahāpurī sāgareṇa parikṣiptā niviṣṭā... ”%}<sup>448</sup>
Hanuman makes a similar statement in describing the strategi-
cal position of Laṅkā: {%Sthitā pāre samudrasya dūrapārasya.%}<sup>449</sup>
Kālidāsa in his Raghuvaṃśa in connexion with {%‘Purīm Laṅkām’%}
writes: {%“Mahārṇava parikṣepam lankāyāḥ parikhālaghum”.%}<sup>450</sup>
With regard to the bridge built by Rāma Kālidāsa notes: {%sa%}
{%setuṃ bandhayāmāsa plavaṅgairlavaṇāmbhasi.%}<sup>451</sup> In the Skanda
Purāṇa<sup>452</sup> and in the Kathāsaritsāgara, we have similar references
to Laṇkā.<sup>453</sup> All these passages point distinctly to the great sea
on the other side of which was situated the great city of Laṅkā.
<div n="P"/>The separate mention of Siṃhala and Laṅkā in many
Sanskrit texts is quoted to show that Laṅkā was distinct from
Ceylon.<sup>454</sup> This is hardly convincing for the separate mention
of Mathurā and Śūrasena, Sāketa and Kosala, Gāndhāra
and Takṣaśilā, Avanti and Ujjainī, did not imply any material
geographical difference as they were treated only as convertible
terms in geographical texts of the Purāṇas. In the Puranic
lists, Laṇkā is a territorial name and Siṃhala is an ethnic name.
As the name of a city in the island of Siṃhala, Laṅkā passed
off as a {%dvīpa,%} and the two names were used in the same
geographical sense. A passage in the Rāmāyaṅa runs thus:
{%“Siṃhalān barbarān mlecchān ye ca laṅkānivāsinaḥ”.%}<sup>455</sup> Hiuen
Tsang also mentions {%Seng-ka-lo%} (Ceylon) which included {%Leug-%}
{%ka%} (Laṅkā).<sup>456</sup> As pointed out by B.C. Law, the Mahāvaṃśa
and its commentary show that Laṅkādvīpa (the lower portion)
was one of the main divisions of the island of Ceylon.<sup>457</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is a valid presumption, therefore, that the ancient name
Laṅkā referred to Ceylon.<sup>458</sup> We may assume further, as seems
very likely, that Laṅkā was the early name of Ceylon and its
literary name as well. Mention is made of {%Laṅkādvīpa%} even in
medieval inscriptions.<sup>459</sup> The Madras museum plates of Jaṭila-
varman refer to the beautiful island of Laṅkā as {%Ilangai.%}<sup>460</sup> Epi-
graphic evidence, however, shows that Siṃhala, another name
[Page-161+ 39]
of ancient Ceylon, was equally well known. Thus the Kanhad
plate of Kṛṣṇa III refers to the island of Siṃhala.<sup>461</sup> In another
inscription the king of Siṃhala is described as waiting on the
shore.<sup>462</sup> In other inscriptions Siṃhala is variously designated
as Siṅgala-deśam,<sup>463</sup> Sīlam<sup>464</sup> and Sihala.<sup>465</sup> All this evidence
favours the suggestion that as territorial names Siṃhala and
Laṅkā were convertible terms, although the latter is also
used as the name of a city. Priaulx remarks and probably,
correctly, that Laṅkā was the old mythological name for
Ceylon, and that later on it was supplanted by Tāmraparṇī,
and subsequently when the Periplus was written, by {%Palaesi-%}
{%mundus%} or {%Palaesimoundon%} which itself was transformed into
{%Salike, Sereṇdiva%} derived from Pali {%Sihala%} or {%Sihala dīpa.%}<sup>466</sup>
The name {%Palaesimoundon%} is very plausibly based on {%“pāre%}
{%samudrasya”,%}<sup>467</sup> in the description given of Laṅkā as noted
above. Ptolemy's Simoundon<sup>468</sup> also refers to that name. But
in Ptolemy's Geography the island is called {%Salike%} which
responds to {%Siele diba%} of {%Kosmas Indicopleustes%}<sup>469</sup> both of
which have their sources in {%Sihalam%} “the Pāli form of Sanskrit
Siṃhala” or Ceylon. To this source may be traced its other
names such as {%Serendib, Zeilan, Sialan,%}<sup>470</sup> the last one yielding
to Ceylon. Marco Polo's {%Seilan%}<sup>471</sup> is a nearer approach to the
modern name. Van-der-turk suggests that the name may have
been derived from {%Sela%} or ‘precious stone’, hence the island
was anciently called {%Ratnadvīpa.%}<sup>472</sup> An Arab historian called
it the “Island of Rubies”. The Chinese name for the island
also implies reference to gems. The name {%Sailān%} also occurs in
the works of Rashiduddin, Hayton and Jordanus.<sup>473</sup> Al-Beruni
called it {%Singaldīb.%}<sup>474</sup> Siṃhala is perhaps so called as once
abounding in lions.<sup>475</sup>
<div n="P"/>We may note here that there are references to another
Siṃhala quite different from Ceylon.<sup>476</sup> It was placed to the
east of Marudeśa and to the south of the Kāmādri. It is evi-
dently in the Punjab-Rajasthan region and reminds us of the
kingdom of {%Siṃhapura%} mentioned by Hiuen Tsang.
