18. {%Ṣāhi%}¦<sup>428</sup> (No. 1, L. 23):
The Ṣāhis are said to have paid homage to Samudragupta.
From the appendix it is clear that Daivaputra is not an adjec-
tive of Ṣāhi as Goyal<sup>429</sup> has surmised and has identified it
with Kidāra Kuṣāṇa of the Great Kuṣāṇa family.
<div n="P"/>Daivaputras have been interpreted to denote the Kuṣāṇas;
so Ṣāhis cannot be identified with the Kuṣāṇas. They must
have been an independent and separate tribe, and may be
identified with the Persians mentioned in the Raghuvaṃśa in
connexion with the North-Westren conquests of Raghu.<sup>430</sup>
<div n="P"/>Goyal<sup>431</sup> identifies the Sassanians with the Pārasīkas of
Kālidāsa. But Pārasīkas can never be identified with Sassanians.
The word ‘Pārasīkas’ itself clearly be speaks of the Persians and
is identical with the modern Parasis. Moreover, Ṣāhānuṣāhis
are to be identified with the Sassanians whereas Ṣāhis refer to
the Persians. Even now the king of Persia (Iran) is known as
‘Shāh of Iran’.
<div n="P"/>Ṣāhi is an Iranian or Persian word and seems to have some
relation with Sanskrit root {%§śās%} to rule, which when formed a
noun means ‘a ruler’. <sup>432</sup> The Śāhi dynasty of Kabul was ousted
by the brāhmaṇa minister of the last king. The new dynasty was
also known as the Śāhis and has been mentioned by Al-Beruni
and Kalhaṇa.
<div n="P"/>The word {%Śāha%} or {%Sāhu,%} often used for banias in villages,
is not connected with Ṣāhi or Śāhi but is to be derived from
Sanskrit {%‘sādhu’.%}<sup>433</sup>
