5. {%Pṛthu%}¦ (No. 2, LL. 7-8):
Samudragupta is stated to have surpassed the kings like
Pṛthu and Rāghava in giving gold. Literally Pṛthu means
broad, wide, expansive, extensive, spacious or large.<sup>66</sup>
<div n="P"/>About nineteen Pṛthus have been mentioned in the Purāṇas,<sup>67</sup>
the most important and famous being the Vainya. Here the
reference seems to this Pṛthu, the Vainya.
<div n="P"/>He is the son of Vena got out of by the churning his
right arm by the sages to save him from falling into hell
and is considered the ninth incarnation of Hari. He was the
first king who introduced agriculture. Due to scarcity of
supply when people complained of hunger, he armed his
arrow and the earth was milked. Hilly tracts were levelled
and different kinds of villages, cities and towns were organised
for the first time. Pṛthu has been panegyrised by the Gandhar-
vas, and Siddhas playing on different musical instruments.<sup>68</sup>
