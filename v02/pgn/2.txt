The inscriptions name Mahārājā Ghaṭotkaca as the successor
of Gupta. He should not be confused with Ghaṭotkacagupta
whose name occurs on some seals found at Vaīśālī, and also
in the Tumain Inscription of Kumāragupta and Ghaṭotkaca-
gupta (G. E. 116).<sup>46</sup>
<div n="P"/>Ghaṭotkaca was the name of a son of Bhīma-sena by the
Rākṣasī Hiḍimbā.<sup>47</sup> Names based on {%Ghaṭa%} are very rare in
Sanskrit literature. Thus Gaṇeśa is named Ghaṭodara ‘pot-
bellied’.<sup>48</sup> The name Ghaṭotkaca refers to the practice of
bearing traditional names based on Epics and Purāṇas. Deriva-
tively it means a person having a hairless head.<sup>49</sup> In Prācīna
Caritrakośa it has been suggested that Ghaṭotkaca was so
called as his head was like a {%ghaṭa%} (pitcher) and was hairless.<sup>50</sup>
Tripathi suggests on the basis of the Skanda Purāṇa that
Ghaṭotkaca was so called as he produced a loud voice while
laughing which may be compared to the voice produced by
thumping the pitcher quite aloud at its mouth by hands.<sup>51</sup> But
[Page-021+ 39]
the first derivation seems to be more plausible from linguistic
point of view<sup>52</sup> while the other explanation may be more
important from socio-psychological or mythological point of
view.
<div n="P"/>It is possible that it was the nickname of Ghaṭotkaca which
might have become his famous name.
