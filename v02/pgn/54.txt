2. {%Bandhuvarmman%}¦ (No. 17, L. 15, L. 16):
Bandhuvarmman was the son of Viśvavarman. He was probably
a feudatory chief, ruling at Dasapura, Mandasor in Western
Malwa,<sup>41</sup> in the time of Kumāragupta I. He has been men-
tioned as a king (nṛpa) governing the city of Daśapura and
it was under his rulership that the Sun-temple was caused to
be built by the guild of silk-cloth weavers at Mandasor (Daśa-
pura). The relevant lines in the inscription lay a stress on his
name Bandhu. He is described as possessed of firmness and
statesmanship; beloved of (his) kinsmen; the relative, as it were,
of (his) subjects; the remover of the afflictions of (his) con-
nections; pre-eminently skilful in destroying the ranks of (his)
proud enemies.<sup>42</sup> Varman is a kṣatriya surname meaning
‘the protector’, the entire expression may literally be trans-
lated as ‘the protector of his relatives’.
