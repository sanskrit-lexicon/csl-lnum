(2) {%Dakṣiṇāpatha%}¦ (No. I, L. 20):
According to inscription No. 1 all the kings of the region
of the north were conquered by Samudragupta who attained
great fame by liberating them.<sup>196</sup> The kingdoms specifically
named as included in the southern region are: Kosala, Mahā-
kāntāra, Kurāḷa, Piṣṭapura, Koṭṭūra, Eraṇḍapalla, Kāñcī,
Avamukta, Veṅgī, Palakka, Devarāṣṭra and Kusthalapura.<sup>197</sup>
“The earliest epigraphical mention of the Dakṣiṇāpatha is
found in the Nānāghaṭ Cave Inscription (Second half of first
Century B.C.)<sup>198</sup> It later appears in the Junāgaṛh Rock In-
scription of Rudradāman (A.D. 150)<sup>199</sup> as also in the Nasik
Cave Inscription of Vāsiṣṭhīputra Pulumāvi (A.D. 149).<sup>200</sup>
<div n="P"/>Literally it means ‘the path or road leading to the south’ and
in short the ‘south country’. As a designation of the Deccan,<sup>201</sup>
the term is found as early as the Baudhāyana Dharmasūtra.<sup>202</sup>
A similar expression is Dakṣiṇā padā, ‘with southward foot’,
occurring in the Ṛgveda,<sup>203</sup> and refers to the place to which
exiles are expelled.<sup>204</sup> Thus the term denoted ‘South’ beyond
the limits of the recognised Āryan world.
<div n="P"/>In the Buddhist literature originally the name seems to
have been restricted to a remote settlement on the Upper
Godāvarī.<sup>205</sup> Some hold that it was situated to the south of
the Narbadā and was identical with the Dakhinabades of the
Greeks.<sup>206</sup>
<div n="P"/>According to the Yādavaprakāśa, Dakṣiṇāpatha is the name
of the country to the south of the Vindhyas and includes
Pāṇḍya, Kuntala, Cola, Mahārāṣṭra, Kerala, Kulya, Setuja,
[Page-224+ 37]
Kulakālaka, Iṣīka, Śabara, Āraṭṭa and other countries.<sup>207</sup>
<div n="P"/>Rājaśekhara places it ahead of Māhiṣmatī. Countries situa-
ted in it are: Mahārāṣṭra, Māhiṣaka, Aśmaka, Vidarbha,
Kuntala, Krathakaiśika, Sūrpāraka, Kāñcī, Kerala, Kavera,
Murala, Vanavāsaka, Siṃhala, Coḍa, Daṇḍaka, Pāṅḍya, Pallava,
Gāṅga, Nāśikya, Koṅkaṇa Kollagiri, Vallara, etc.<sup>208</sup>
<div n="P"/>Thus we see that Dakṣiṇāpatha in later times came to
represent more or less the whole of the south.
