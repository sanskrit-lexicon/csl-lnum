 {%Airikiṇa%}¦ (No. 2, L. 25):
It has been described here as the bhoga-nagara of the king (sva-
bhoga-nagara).<sup>164</sup> In this context the use of the phrase ‘Sva-
bhoganagara’ is important. K.P. Jayaswal<sup>165</sup> interprets ‘sva bho-
ganagara’ as a town that had, since the victory scored by the
Gupta king at Eraṇ, become his direct personal possession.
Fleet translates it as ‘the city of his own enjoyment’.<sup>166</sup>
<div n="P"/>Daśaratha Sharma<sup>167</sup> explains it as analogous to the word
‘Ekabhoga’ defined in the Mānasāra as a town or village inha-
bited by a single land-holder along with his dependants.<sup>168</sup> It
is ‘Svabhoga’ for the master and ‘Ekabhoga’ for others’. Sharma
connects this ‘Svabhoga’ with a feudatory ‘who lived therein
with his family and dependants, and on whom Samudragupta,
pleased by his ‘devotion’, policy, and valour’ conferred the title
of Rājan and the accompanying glories of consecration, etc.
described in verse 4.<sup>169</sup> But Sharma seems to be incorrect in
associating the inscription with a feudatory, the inscription
belongs to Samudragupta himself which is clear by further
description in subsequent verses.<sup>170</sup> No doubt in the Eraṇ
Stone Boar Inscription of Toramāṇa<sup>171</sup> the word ‘sva-viṣaya’
an adjectival clause of Airikiṇa is used to refer to a feudatory,
which is very clear from the inscription.
<div n="P"/>The editor<sup>172</sup> also, following Sharma, is misled and ex-
plains the term ‘Svabhoga’ as implying a grant, or something
like it by the governor of the province, who had for his own
salary the revenues of the city of Airikiṇa allotted to him.<sup>173</sup>
But the term ‘Svabhoganagara’ is significant in connoting royal
status, higher than that of a feudatory chief and can mean
‘the capital city’ where the king himself was residing. In con-
trast, in the Earṇ Stone Boar Inscription of Toramāṇa<sup>174</sup> the
[Page-221+ 38]
term ‘Sva-viṣaya’ has been used for the feudatory Dhanyaviṣṇu
(of king Toramāṇa) who may have been a viṣayapati, the ad-
ministrator-incharge of Eraṇ.
<div n="P"/>Airikiṇa is the same as modern Eraṇ, the ancient Airikiṇa,
a village on the left bank of the Bina, in Sagar District of
Madhya Pradesh. From the Copper Coins of the Aśokan
period found at Eraṇ, we get an earlier Pali or Prakrit form
of the name which is Erakaña or Erakana or Erakaṇa.<sup>175</sup> It
is thus clear that Erakaña or Erakaṇa is the simplified form of
Erikiṇa: to simplify still more the medial letter ‘k’ has been
dropped by the process of elision.<sup>176</sup> The meaning of the word
Erikiṇa is a puzzle but its connexion with erakā ‘a kind of
grass,<sup>177</sup> found in that area may be accepted as a hypothesis.
