7. {%Vargga, Vargga-grāmika%}¦ (No. 46, L. 12, L. 15):
He was the middle son of Hari-śreṣṭhin. In L. 12 he is men-
tioned only as Vargga and in L. 15 as Vargga-grāmika. While
his father is called a {%śreṣṭhin%} he was not {%śreṣṭhin%} or banker by
profession. The word {%grāmika%} affixed to Vargga's name suggests
that he was the headman of a village which seems to be no
other than Avaḍāra. Vargga literally means one who excludes
or removes or averts’.<sup>7</sup>
