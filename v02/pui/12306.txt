{%Varma Nārāyaṇātmakam%}¦ — a Vaiṣṇavī vidyā, taught by
Viśvarūpa to Indra. Here the various manifestations of Hari
[Page3-162+ 25]
including that of the Buddha are recalled. Once a certain
Kauśikan practised this and gave up his life in a desert. When
a Gandharva crossed the bones of this dead man, he fell
down on the earth. Instructed by Vālakhilyas, he collected
the bones, and after throwing them into the Sarasvatī, and
bathing there, returned to his place. Taught originally to
Tvaṣṭri by Dadhyanga; Tvaṣṭri taught it to Viśvarūpa.
