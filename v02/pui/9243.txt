{%Brahmadatta%} (III)¦ — the son of Vibhrāja, the Pāñcāla
king; in previous birth Pitṛvarti (s.v.), a son of Kauśika;
his queen Sannati, daughter of Devala, being in one of her
previous births the cow of Garga, was killed by Kauśika's
sons during a famine; was anointed the Pāñcāla king, and
his two brothers in his previous birth, became his ministers;
[Page2-507+ 29]
both king and queen once visited the pleasure garden and
were taken by surprise at the sight of the love quarrels
between two ants who were husband and wife; the wife
accused the husband of taking pieces of {%modaka%} (sweet-
meat) to a neighbouring lady-love, an ant; the husband
confessed that it was offered so thinking that she was her-
self, his own wife and that he would behave more carefully
in future; B. understood this as he could follow the language
of all insects by divine grace; when Sannati thought that
the king laughed at her and took it seriously, he took a
vow for seven days and at the sight of Sudaridra, the
Brahmana, remembered his past and became a Siddha him-
self having anointed his son Viśvakṣena on the throne.
