{%amśa%} of Hari; brought up in his early age by the sage Kaṇva;
became {%cakravarti%} after his father; anointed Adhirāṭ; per-
formed 55 horse sacrifices on the banks of the Ganges and
the Yamunā with the aid of Purodha Māmatiya; he tied to
the sacrificial post 3300 horses and distributed liberally cows
and elephants to priests; he brought under his subjection
the Kirātas, Hūṇas, Yavanas, Āndhras, and all the Mlecchas;
he recovered the celestial women from Rasātala; he ruled
righteously for 27000 years; he had three wives of Vidarbha
origin; as they did not resemble their father the nine sons
born to these were killed by their mothers who feared that
they might be set aside; to perpetuate his line, Bharata per-
formed Marutsoma when the Maruts presented him Bharad-
vāja, son of Bṛhaspati whom he adopted as his son;<sup>1</sup> made the
16 gifts;<sup>2</sup> again performed Marutsoma for getting a son; Bha-
radvāja was born as Vitatha to Bharata when Bharata died.
