{%Rāma%} (I)¦ — Balabhadra of the Yādava race and lord
of Dvārakā. (Balarāma): brother of Kṛṣṇa and Subhadrā;
See Baladeva; eldest son of Vasudeva by Rohinī; father of
two sons; welcomed Kṛṣṇa to Dvārakā; asked by Kṛṣṇa to
take one of the two heavenly chariots and get ready to fight
Jarāsandha. Rāma blew his conch and began fighting
[Page3-072+ 44]
under his palmyra ensign; defeated the enemies on all sides.
Fastened Jarāsandha with ropes but Kṛṣṇa set him free;
when Jarāsandha encamped on the Yamunā, was consulted
by Kṛṣṇa; fought successfully Jarāsandha a third time and
defeated Bāṇa's army; when about to give a death-blow
to Jarāsandha, a voice from the welkin said “do not kill
Jarāsandha; go back.” Thus Jarāsandha was allowed to go
back to his city.<sup>1</sup> Honoured by the Yādhava sabha, went
with Kṛṣṇa to the Gomanta hill; on the way met and bowed
to Paraśurāma; helped Kṛṣṇa in killing Śṛgāla Vaśudeva and
was welcomed by the citizens of Karavīrapura. Stayed in
this city for four months and returned to Mathurā with his
brother. Attacked by Jarāsandha's army, fled with Kṛṣṇa
to Gomanta, pursued by Jarāsandha; reached Dvārakā
safe.<sup>2</sup> Married Revatī before the advent of Kali and hence
very tall in appearance; with his plough he brought down
her height to his level.<sup>3</sup>
<div n="P"/>Heard of Kṛṣṇa going alone to Kuṇḍina and of the pre-
parations of Caidya to fight him; went with his army to
Kuṇḍina and was welcomed by its king: Attacked Caidya's
party pursuing Kṛṣṇa and Rukmiṇī on that account.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>Went to Hāstinapura with Kṛṣṇa after the reported
burning of the Pāṇḍavas and Kuntī: Pursued Śatadhanvan
with Kṛṣṇa and finding he had not the {%Syamanta%} in his
person, sent Kṛṣṇa back to Dvārakā and himself to Mithilā
as Janaka's guest; taught the use of the gadā (mace) to
Duryodhana. Did not agree with Kṛṣṇa in returning the
jewel to Akrūra. Left for Videha after Satadhanvan's
death.<sup>5</sup>
<div n="P"/>Attended Aniruddha's marriage at Bhojakaṭa where
induced by Kalinga and other friends, Rukmin invited
Rāma for a game of dice: in it, Rāma sometimes lost and
sometimes gained. At his loss Kalinga laughed showing
his teeth. When Rukmin played false it was referred to
[Page3-073+ 38]
a mediator who was unfortunately Kalinga and who there-
fore maintained that Rukmi was in the right. A voice
from the air said: “Rukmi tells an untruth”. Without
heeding to this Rukmi insulted Rāma as a forester and
herdsman and new to the art of dice. Rāma got enraged,
took the mace and vanquished Rukmi: next he pulled out
the teeth of Kalinga making fun of him all the time: others
fled in fear; returned to Dvārakā.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>His picture was among those drawn by Citrālekhā: In-
vaded Bāṇa's city, fought with Kumbhāṇḍa and Kūpa-
karṇa. Once drove to Vraja and spent two months there.
During nights he sported and sang with Gopis on the
Yamunā drinking Vāruṇī and playing in the waters: changed
the course of the river by his plough:<sup>7</sup> Yamunā (s.v.)
presented him with clothes, and ornaments with which he
shone brighter than ever.<sup>8</sup> Desire for more territory.<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>Wanted to give Subhadrā in marriage to Duryodhana
but Kṛṣṇa was for her marriage with Arjuna. The latter
went to Dvārakā as an ascetic when Rāma one day invited
him for {%bhikṣa.%} It was an opportunity for Arjuna and
Subhadrā to see each other. Arjuna carried her away on a
festive occasion with Kṛṣṇa's consent. Rāma's wrath was
pacified by Kṛṣṇa. Then he approved of the marriage and sent
him presents.<sup>10</sup> Unable to recover the dead son of the Dvā-
rakā Brāhmaṇa.<sup>11</sup> Founded the city of Govardhana on the
upper regions of the Godāvarī in the northern part of the
Sahya mountain.<sup>12</sup> The God of Love cursed to be born as
the brother of Kṛṣṇa at Dvārakā.<sup>13</sup>
