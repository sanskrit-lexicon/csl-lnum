{%Dhundhu%} (IV)¦ — a son of Manu and an Asura who
entered into sandy deserts near the āśrama of the sage
Uttanka and performed a cruel penance for the ruin of the
world; once a year he breathed and the breath shook the
earth for seven days with dust enclosing the sun's rays. He
was killed by Kuvalāśva who became Dhundhumāra.
