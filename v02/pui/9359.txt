tered Brahmāṇḍa from outside by its being pierced by the
tip of the toe of Trivikrama's left foot; in course of time she
reached the celestial region known as Viṣṇupada; held sacred
by Dhruva and the seven sages; crossing the region of the

moon she reaches the city of Brahmā; there she divides into
four branches and falls into the western and eastern seas.
