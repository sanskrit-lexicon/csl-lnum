{%Kāvya%} (I)¦ — a son of Bhṛgu and Divyā; also {%Śukra,%}
{%Uśana,%} the {%Ācārya%} for devas and asuras; Kavisuta and the
name of a planet; wife Gonāma, had four sons, Tvaṣṭa,
Varūtrī, Śaṇḍa, and Marka;<sup>1</sup> the lord of Bhṛgus;<sup>2</sup> cursed
Yayāti.<sup>3</sup> Asuras defeated by Indra appealed to Kāvya
and resolved to go to Rasātala; Kāvya encouraged them and
said that rains, vegetation, etc., would stand completely with
them and only (1/4) with the devas; at that time the devas
appealed to him for help; but Kāvya went to Mahādeva and
learnt the {%mantra%} for their success; in the meantime he
asked them to keep quiet and perform austerities after lay-
ing their weapons down. Mahādeva insisted on {%Kuṇḍa-%}
{%dhūma%} observance for a thousand years with their heads
down; while so engaged the asuras got afraid of the devas
and appealed to his mother and the wife of Bhṛgu; she
offered them shelter but finding them being killed by the
devas she resolved to deprive Indra of his place; then Indra
appealed to Viṣṇu whose body he entered; but she set on
[Page1-371+ 36]
fire the whole world of devas, when out of rage Viṣṇu killed
her; Bhṛgu cursed him to be born seven times among men;
then by power of {%tapas%} he restored his wife to life;
Śukra's religious observance so as to please him; penance
over, Maheśvara granted him three things: non-defeat
by others, lordship over wealth, and eternal life; on
this he praised {%Nīlalohita%} by many names; pleased,
Śiva disappeared; then Śukra was attracted towards Jayantī
the daughter of Indra and promised to be with her
for ten years unknown to the asuras by means of
{%māyā;%} when Kāvya returned the asuras were pleased;
but during the ten years Bṛhaspati appeared before
the asuras in the guise of Kāvya and pretended to speak to
them the {%mantra%} he had heard; the asuras accepted him;
ten years were over and a daughter Devayāni was born to
Śukra who appeared before the asuras; finding two Kāvyas
the asuras became mystified and Kāvya said that he was
Bṛhaspati in disguise; the asuras did not believe in the real
Śukra who left them in anger; soon they found out the
mistake and approached Śukra through Prahlāda and he
became pleased; then he approached Brahmā who said that
after ten {%yugas%} and in the Svārociṣa Yuga the asuras would
get back their kingdom; saying this he pointed out to two
disciples Saṇḍa and Marka equal to Bṛhaspati, and at last
the devas were defeated. Seeing the success of the asuras
Viṣnu took different avatars to put them down.<sup>4</sup>
