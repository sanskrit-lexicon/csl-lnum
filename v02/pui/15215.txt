{%Satyavrata%} (III)¦ — a son of Trayyāruṇi (Trayyāmuṇa-
{%M. P.%}) who took to wife Vidarbha's queen; for this un-
righteousness he was banished by his father to live with
Śvāpakas; when his father went to the forest there was no
shower for 12 years when Satyavrata performed austeri-
ties and helped the sons and wives of Viśvāmitra in their
livelihood; Vasiṣṭha was in charge of the kingdom and did
not invite him; enraged at this he killed his cow and fed
Viśvāmitra's family; Viśvāmitra noticed three departures
from dharma and called him Triśaṅku; Viśvāmitra was
pleased with his aid and took him to heaven with his earthly
body to the wonder of even Vasiṣṭha; his wife was Satya-
vratā and son Hariścandra.
