{%Sāman,%} and Brahmā, the {%Atharvamantras,%}<sup>2</sup> its śākhas are 27;
arranged by Vaiśampāyana, pupil of Vyāsa, and taught to his
disciples including Yājñavalkya; the latter was made to
vomit for his behaviour, all the texts, which the other
disciples digested, in the form of partridges and hence this
portion came to be known as Taittirīya; but Yājñavalkya
prayed to the Sun-god who initiated him into the other por-
tions of the Yajus in the form of a horse and hence called
Vājaseneya;<sup>3</sup> part of Viṣṇu.<sup>4</sup>
