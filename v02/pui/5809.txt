{%Dadhīci%} (I)¦ — (also Dadhyañja, Dadhyanga) the son of
Atharvan and Citti.<sup>1</sup> A sage of much eminence. Taught
{%Aśvāśiras mantra%} to Aśvins and {%Nārāyaṇa varma%} to Tvaṣṭri,
who gave it to Viśvarūpa. The Lord advised Indra to meet
the sage whose bones would serve as best weapons to cut
Vṛtra's head. When the gods waited on him with this desire,
he argued at first that no one would be willing to part with
his life. But, he would agree for their sake to sacrifice his
life. When he cast off his body, Viśvakarma made it a Vajra
for the use of Indra.<sup>2</sup> Dadhīci's is an example of one, who
gave up life in service.<sup>3</sup>
