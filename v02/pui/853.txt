{%Arjuna%}¦ (I) {%(Kārtavīrya)%} — son of Kṛtavīrya. Lord of
seven islands and of Haihayaṣ, {%Samrāṭ%} and {%Cakravartin.%}
By the grace of Hari he got 1000 arms and enjoyed {%aṣṭa-%}
{%aiśvaryas.%} Learnt the merit of {%yoga%} from Dattātreya. Ruled
in peace for 85,000 years<sup>1</sup> and was ambitious to have more
territorial possessions.<sup>2</sup> Was engaged in water-sports with
women wearing the garland of Vaijayanti.<sup>3</sup> Imprisoned
Rāvaṇa in his capital Māhiṣmatī and released him on an
appeal from Pulasya.<sup>4</sup> In the course of a hunting expedi-
tion, he came to the hermitage of Jamadagni who enter-
tained him with the help of his Kāmadhenu. The king,
envious of the sage's prosperity, desired its possession, and
on being refused by the sage, he took the cow by force.<sup>5</sup>
Parasurāma who was away, heard the story on his return,
went to Arjuna's capital, cut off his head with his axe after
a terrible battle in which Matsyarāja took part and
recovered the cow and the calf.<sup>6</sup> Jamadagni regretted his
son's action as the king was a {%Naradeva,%} and killing him
was an offence greater than brāhmanicide.<sup>7</sup> Had 1000 (?)
sons, (100 sons) all of whom except five died in battles.
These sons killed Jamadagni when Rāma and his brothers
were gone out.<sup>8</sup> These five were great warriors.<sup>9</sup> His
minister was the evil Candragupta and the {%Purohita,%}
Garga.<sup>10</sup> Incarnation of Viṣṇu Cakra;<sup>11</sup> to his family
belonged Tālajaṅgha;<sup>12</sup> performed thousands of {%yajñas%} with
golden {%yūpas%} and {%vedis,%} which were attended by gods. A
Rājaṛṣi, paśupāla, kṣetrapāla.<sup>13</sup> Defeated Karkoṭaka's son at
Māhiṣmatī and established his city on the banks of the Nar-
madā. Could control the waters of the Narmadā and
the fury of the ocean: a terror to Asuras in Pātāla as also
to Rākṣasas and Uragas. Defeated Rāvaṇa and released
[Page1-107+ 40]
him at the intervention of Pulastya: burnt down the Hema-
tālavanam, residence of Āpava and was cursed that a Bhār-
gava and a Brāhmaṇa would chop off his 1000 hands.<sup>14</sup> A
{%gātha%} in his honour by Nārada.<sup>14(a</sup> Once Āditya in the guise
of a Brāhmaṇa asked to be fed at the expense of all im-
mobile things {%(sthāvara)%} in the world and it was granted.

{%Saubhāgyaśayana-vratam%} and made the 16 gifts.<sup>16</sup>
