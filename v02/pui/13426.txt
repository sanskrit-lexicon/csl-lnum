{%Vṛka%} (VII)¦ — a son of Śakuni and an Asura; met Nārada
who advised him to perform tapas in honour of Śiva. He
did so by cutting his own flesh for six days and on the seventh
was about to cut off his head when Śiva appeared and blessed
that whosesoever head he touched that person should die. He
attempted it on Śiva who ran to Vaikuṇṭha. Hari in the
form of a Brahmacārin asked him to try the boon on him-
self. The wicked Asura did so and met with his death.
