{%Ardhanārīnaravapuḥ%}¦ — from Hiraṇyagarbha: two parts,
male and female; the male half divided into eleven parts
called Rudras by crying and running (oozing); each became
a {%gaṇeśvara;%} the female half came to be divided into two,
Śukla (right) and Kṛṣṇa (left); from her came {%Prajñā%} and
{%Śrī%} and these in turn spread over the whole world in
thousand ways.
