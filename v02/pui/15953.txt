{%Sukanyā%} (I)¦ — A daughter of Sayāti: when once she
went with her father to the hermitage of Cyavana, she saw
an anthill with two luminous objects in holes which she
pricked with a thorn. This resulted in blood-flowing from
the eyes of the sage Cyavana. The king asked the sage's
pardon by giving his daughter in marriage. Aśvins called
on them and made Cyavana look young to the puzzle of
Sukanyā. The Aśvins revealed to her of Cyavana's rejuvena-
tion. Once her father came and seeing her with a young
man, he took him to be her paramour and scolded her. But
when he heard the truth of the matter he was pleased.
