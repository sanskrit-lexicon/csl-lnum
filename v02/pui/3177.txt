{%Kumāraka%}¦ — the first offspring of Brahmā when he was
engaged in thinking of creation devoid of {%śabda, sparśa,%}
{%rūpa, rasa%} and {%gandha.%} Brahmā pondered over a form
which would be neither male nor female but with colours.
Then {%Akṣara%} came out of ‘his neck; it was {%Omkāra%} with one
{%mātra,%} then two {%mātrākṣara,%} three {%akṣaras,%} then fourteen-
faced deva and 14 Manus.
