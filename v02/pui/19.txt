{%Akrūra%} (I)¦ — a Yadu prince; welcomed Kṛṣṇa to Dvā-
raka.<sup>1</sup> The foremost of the sons of Śvaphalka and Gāndinī;
married a daughter of Ugrasena and had two sons, Devavān
and Upadeva (Deva and Anupadeva-{%Vi%}).<sup>2</sup> Stayed in Madhu-
rā (Mathurā) when the Yadus migrated.<sup>3</sup> Once visited Brah-
maḥrada.<sup>4</sup> Kaṃsa sent for him and asked him to take in
his chariot Kṛṣṇa and Rāma to the capital for the Dhanur-
yāga (‘festival of arms’) at which they were to be killed.
Returned home with this message.<sup>5</sup> When the night passed
by, Akrūra started for the {%vraja%} of Nanda thinking all the way
of the meeting and embraces of Kṛṣṇa and Rāma who had
made friends with people of Brindāvan. Reached Gokula
by evening.<sup>6</sup> Saw Rāma and Kṛṣṇa in fine deportment and
form, milking cows: prostrated before them in divine ecstasy.
Welcomed in the proper way by the brothers and Nanda,
Akrūra was lost in wonder, and did not feel the fatigue of the
journey.<sup>7</sup> Gopis who came to know of Akrūra's mission called
him Krūra for taking away Kṛṣṇa from their midst.<sup>8</sup> It was
early morning when Akrūra and the two brothers started
after morning prayers. Reaching the Yamunā, Akrūra went
to the river for a bath, asking the brothers to stay in the cha-
riot. But he was surprised to see the brothers in the waters,
and at the same time in the chariot also. He also saw Hari
reclining on Śeṣa.<sup>9</sup> Akrūra's praise of Hari.<sup>10</sup> Con-
gratulating himself on his luck to have had a {%darśan%} of Hari,
he drove Kṛṣṇa and Rāma to Mathurā before sunset.<sup>11</sup>
Invited Kṛṣṇa to his home, and the latter agreed to go to
his place only after Kaṃsavadha. Informed Kaṃsa of
[Page1-004+ 49]
Kṛṣṇa's arrival in the camp, and went back to his house.<sup>12</sup>
Attended the wrestling match.<sup>12(a</sup> Gopis took Uddhava to
Akrūra.<sup>13</sup> Was visited by Kṛṣṇa with Rāma and Uddhava to
whom Akrūra gave a royal welcome.<sup>14</sup> Kṛṣṇa told Akrūra
that they looked to him for guidance, and that he was their
{%guru.%} Was requested by Kṛṣṇa to go to Hastināpura to find
out the exact position of the Pāṇḍavas.<sup>15</sup> Visited Hastināpura
and returned to Mathurā after meeting Kunti and ascertain-
ing the evil intentions of Dhṛtarāṣṭṛa against the Pāṇḍavas.<sup>16</sup>
One of those stationed by Kṛṣṇa to defend the western gate
of Mathurā,<sup>17</sup> was consulted by Kṛṣṇa on the eve of his attack
on Jarāsandha.<sup>18</sup> A member of the Yādava sabhā.<sup>19</sup> Satya-
bhāmā refusing to part with the jewel Syamantaka (s.v.),
Akrūra suggested with Kṛtavarman to Śatadhanvan Bhoja
its seizure from Satrājita as he had failed to keep his promise
to marry his daughter to them.<sup>20</sup> Asked by Śatadhanvan for
help against Kṛṣṇa, Akrūra refused; Bhoja Śatadhanvan
killed Satrājita, the father of Satyabhāmā, and secured
the jewel but placed it in Akrūra's custody.<sup>21</sup> Became
afraid, after Śatadhanva's death at the hands of Kṛṣṇa and
Balarāma, and left Dvārakā. Evil portents in the city and
cessation of rains. It was said that rain fell where Akrūra
lived. Was sent for by Kṛṣṇa to return to Dvārakā; gave
his sister in marriage to Kṛṣṇa who after duly honouring
him, requested him to show the jewel in public, so that
Rāma might not misunderstand him. He did so in the
sabhā of the Sātvatas but Kṛṣṇa placed Syamantaka back
in his hand.<sup>22</sup> Was sent back to Dvārakā after the Rāja-
sūya for its defence.<sup>23</sup> Visited Syamantapañcaka on the
occasion of the solar eclipse.<sup>24</sup> Fought with Bhoja, deluded
by Kṛṣṇa.<sup>25</sup> Got killed in the Yādava contest at Prabhāsa.<sup>26</sup>
