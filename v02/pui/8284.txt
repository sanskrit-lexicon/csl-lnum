{%Pṛthu%} (I)¦ — (Vainya) the son got out of Vena by the
churning of his right arm by the sages to save him from
falling into hell: is considered the ninth incarnation of
Hari. The first king who introduced agriculture.<sup>1</sup> Pane-
gyrised by the Gandharvas, and Siddhas playing on different
musical instruments. For his coronation, presents came
from Indra, Brahmā, Yama, Rudra and other gods; praised
by Sūta, Māgadha and Bandin. Though these were dis-
couraged, yet they continued to praise him for his righteous
administrative policy. His sway extended to the Udaya
hills.<sup>2</sup>
<div n="P"/>Due to scarcity of supply, people complained of
hunger, when Pṛthu aimed his arrow and threatened to
vanquish her. The earth let herself be milked. With Svā-
yambhuva Manu for the calf and his own palms as pail; he
milked the essence of all plants. This was followed by the
sages, gods, asuras and others. Hilly tracts were levelled,
and different kinds of villages, cities and towns were orga-
nised for the first time.<sup>3</sup>
<div n="P"/>Consecrated himself to perform one hundred aśvame-
dhas on the Sarasvatī. When 99 were over, jealous Indra
ran away with the sacrificial horse. Advised by Atri, the
king's son pursued him as the kite did Rāvaṇa and recover-
ing the animal, earned the title Vijitāśva. Again Indra stole
the horse, and Vijitāśva pursued him and recovered it.
Pṛthu saw marks of sin on the part of Indra behaving like
[Page2-382+ 42]
a miscreant and aimed his arrow at him. Persuaded by
Brahmā, he controlled his rage and became friendly to
Indra. On advice from Viṣṇu, he cast off his enmity to
Indra and embraced him. Asked of the Lord to be ever
devoted to him.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>On his return to the capital, the citizens accorded him
a welcome. Made the middle country between Gangā and
Yamunā his home. Advised his subjects, who praised him, to
conduct themselves righteously. Was visited by Sanatkumāra
with three other sages who taught him {%ātmagñāna.%}<sup>5</sup> His
queen Arcis gave birth to five sons, all rising to his ideal.
He followed the path of the Lokapālas, and his fame as of
Somarāja reached the ears of women as that of Rāma the
ears of the virtuous.<sup>6</sup> Finding himself aged, he entrusted
the kingdom to his sons and left with his queen to the forest.
Launched on a course of severe penance until his last
breath went out of his body. In the funeral pyre which the
queen lighted for her husband's cremation, she threw her-
self and ascended to heaven, praised by the wives of the gods.<sup>7</sup>
Thus Pṛthu, the lord of seven dvīpas, still thirsting to have
more territory, renounced his kingdom and sought refuge
with Hari.<sup>8</sup> A Mantrakṛt of the Cākṣusa Manu line. The
first Kṣatriya to be a Rāja. By him the earth became known
as Pṛthvi.<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>His accession was the occasion of a {%pratisarga%} when
rulers were appointed over several classes of beings; got the
grace of Viṣṇu and milked the cow-earth, got grains and
eatables and made the earth flow with milk and honey;
there was no need for the application of the Arthaśāstra
maxims; he levelled the ground from Cape Comorin to the
Himālayas and cleared the forests;<sup>10</sup> made it safe and secure;
made the 16 gifts.<sup>11</sup>
