{%Śiśupāla%}¦ — a son of Śrutaśravas and Damaghoṣa; in pre-
vious births, Hiraṇyakaśipu killed by Narasimha and Rāvaṇa
(Daśagrīva) killed by Rāma; a hater of Hari but was shown
grace by Kṛṣṇa;<sup>1</sup> attacked the northern gate of Mathurā and
Gomanta when they were besieged by Jarāsandha;<sup>2</sup> engaged
by Bhīṣmaka for his daughter Rukmiṇī under the influence
of Rukmin, his eldest son; defeated by Kṛṣṇa who carried
off Rukmiṇī; consoled by his friends that Time was not in
his favour he returned to his city.<sup>3</sup> Protested against the
place of honour being given to Kṛṣṇa when Brahmaṛṣis and
Rājaṛṣis were available. He vilified him as a cowherd given
to drinking and not an observer of Varṇadharma. While the
Pāṇḍavas drew their swords, Kṛṣṇa cut off his head.<sup>4</sup> His
[Page3-433+ 35]
friend was Śālva who summoned a conference at Kuṇḍina
to which Śiśupāla went.<sup>5</sup> As he died remembering the Lord,
he attained mokṣa;<sup>6</sup> (see Caidya). Maitreya asked Parāśara
how it was that though he was killed by the Lords Nara-
simha and Rāma, Hiraṇyakaśipu did not attain salvation but
was reborn as Śisupāla, and how he attained it when killed
by Kṛṣṇa; Parāśara replied that neither Hiraṇyakaśipu nor
Rāvaṇa knew that Narasimha or Rāma were the {%avatārs%} of
Viṣṇu; Śiśupāla knew in his heart of hearts that Kṛṣṇa was
God Viṣṇu and welcomed death at his hands. Hence his
salvation.<sup>7</sup>
