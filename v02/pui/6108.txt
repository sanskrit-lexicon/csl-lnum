{%Durvāsa%} (I)¦ — a son of Atri and an younger brother
of Dattātreya;<sup>1</sup> an {%amśa%} of Śiva;<sup>2</sup> appeared before Ambarīṣa
who was about to break his {%dvādasi%} fast; agreed to accept
his hospitality, went to the river for bath and tarried there;
finding the {%muhūrta%} for {%pāraṇa%} (break-fast) drawing to a
close, the king broke his fast with some water. Coming to
know of this on his return, the sage produced a flaming
spirit to attack him. But Hari's {%cakra%} burnt it down and
turned towards the sage, who ran for succour to Brahmā,
Śiva and Viṣṇu. All of them were unable to help; but Hari
advised him to meet Ambarīṣa and apologise to him.<sup>3</sup> This
he did and was set at liberty. After partaking the meals with
him, he returned to Brahmaloka;<sup>4</sup> blessed Pṛtha with secret
{%mantras%} to summon gods.<sup>5</sup> Through him Duryodhana
planned to destroy the Pāṇḍavas by inciting him to go to
them and ask for a feast. But Kṛṣṇa protected them on the
occasion.<sup>6</sup> In the course of his sojourn he met a Vidyā-
[Page2-106+ 23]
dhara maid with a garland given to her by the Devī; took it
from her and presented it to Indra who put it on his elephant,
who in turn threw it on the ground and trampled upon it.
Enraged at this, the sage cursed him to be lost to all fortune.<sup>7</sup>
