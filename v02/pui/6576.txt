{%Dharmavratā%}¦ — a daughter of Dharma and Viśvarūpa,
performed tapas; Marīci noticed her and desired to marry
her; she asked him to request her father Dharma; he went,
and on Dharma agreeing, marriage was celebrated; she lived
happily; after a sojourn in the woods, Marīci returned home
tired and wanted her to massage his legs during his sleep;
while she was so engaged, down came her father-in-law
whom she honoured; finding that she was not doing what
he desired her to do, the husband cursed her to become a
stone, and despite her severe austerities the curse became
true.
