{%Nīdāgha%}¦ — son of Pulastya; initiated into {%jñāna%} by
Ṛbhu. Engaged himself in austerities for a thousand years
in a grove in Vīranagara on the banks of the Devikā. After
this period at the time of taking meals, Ṛbhu appeared
before him, but was not recognised. Being requested for
meals, Ṛbhu agreed on condition that he would be served
with sweet viands. After meals, he found that he was his old
master, and was overjoyed. He went away, and Nīdāgha
continued his austerities for another 1000 years. At the end
[Page2-256+ 33]
of this period Ṛbhu appeared and saw him standing aloof
from a crowd witnessing the king riding on his elephant.
Ṛbhu asked him who was the king and who was the elephant.
Nidāgha said that the man above was king and that below the
elephant. Ṛbhu asked him what he meant by above and
below. Little knowing that he was his master, Nīdāgha
jumped on him and remarked he was above and Ṛbhu below.
Finding that Nīdāgha had not attained full maturity in
{%advaita,%} Ṛbhu once again initiated him and departed. From
that day Nīdāgha looked upon anything without any distinc-
tion.
