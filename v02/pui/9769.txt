Vedas from Manu.<sup>3</sup>
<div n="P"/>Deputed by the sages to find out the greatest of the
Gods, went to his father's court without invoking him in
praise; Brahmā grew angry but restrained his anger. Then
he went to Śiva, who embraced him. Bhṛgu told him that
he did not like his behaviour when Śiva grew angry and
started to attack him with his trident. He was stopped by
Pārvatī's intervention. Next he called on Hari and kicked
him while sleeping, on His chest. Hari coolly bore it, bowed
to him and said that only then he became purified and
united with Lakṣmī. Bhṛgu wondered at his patience and
concluded that he was the greatest of all the gods.<sup>4</sup> Wonder-
