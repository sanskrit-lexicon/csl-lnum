{%Rukmiṇī%} (I)¦ — a daughter of Bhīṣmaka and known as
Vaidarbhī. Married to Kṛṣṇa according to Gāndharva?
(Rākṣasa) form;<sup>1</sup> when she came to know of the proposal of
her eldest brother Rukmi (s.v.) to give her in marriage to
Caidya, she sent a letter through a Brāhmaṇa to Kṛṣṇa show-
ing her unflinching devotion to him and requesting that she
might be carried off when she would be on her way to the
Devī temple on the day prior to the wedding as was the
custom. That day she had her bath and decked herself
with two clothes and many jewels. Her anxiety at not
having heard from Kṛṣṇa, when the Brāhmaṇa came to tell
her that Kṛṣṇa would do the needful. Citizens were also
for her marriage with Kṛṣṇa. Well guarded and accom-
panied by singing and dancing, Rukmiṇī entered the temple
and prayed for Kṛṣṇa's hand. After worshipping Indrāṇī
nearby she returned when Kṛṣṇa carried her away in his
chariot. Seeing the party of Caidya pursuing him, Rukmiṇī
became nervous when Kṛṣṇa consoled her. When Caidya
was about to be killed by Kṛṣṇa she appealed to the Lord to
spare him; Rāma consoled her. The regular marriage and
festivities followed.<sup>2</sup> Mother of 11 sons and a daughter;
gave birth to Pradyumna who was stolen by Śambara and
thrown into the sea. Recovered and taken back by Māyā-
vatī alias Ratī; Rukmiṇī remembered her lost son and won-
dered at his exact resemblance. At that time came Kṛṣṇa
and Nārada who explained the history of Pradyumna to

attached; would not like to be away from Kṛṣṇa; when she
was once fanning him gently Kṛṣṇa cut a joke that his status
was poor and that she could even then get married to a rich
prince and enjoy luxuries. Rukmiṇī wept in deep distress
and spoke words reiterating her full devotion to him. Kṛṣṇa
consoled her assuring her of his loyalty.<sup>4</sup> Grave concern at

time. Her daughter Cārumatī was married to the son of
