{%Śālva%}¦ — a Dānava king and friend of Śiśupāla and
Jarāsandha; an enemy of Kṛṣṇa; when Hamsa, his
brother, was killed by Kṛṣṇa he wanted to avenge his death
and after meeting his friends at Kuṇḍina, took a vow to wipe
out the Yādavas; he performed tapas to propitiate Śiva and
got an aerial car to go to any place, given to him by
Maya; hearing of Śiśupāla's death, he grew angry and at-
tacked Dvārakā. Pradyumna, Sātyaki and others offered
resistance. His commander-in-chief was defeated. But his
minister Dyumat hit Pradyumna in the chest when his cha-
rioteer removed him from the field. After recovering,
he attacked Dyumat and vanquished him. For twenty-
seven days the battle went on, when Kṛṣṇa arrived.
He directed his attack towards Śālva, who attacked
him when his bow slipped from his hand. After
a hot discussion and some more fight, Śālva dis-
appeared and sent to Kṛṣṇa a māyā messenger saying that
Vasudeva had been taken prisoner by Śālva. Then Kṛṣṇa
saw a scene where a māyā Vasudeva was killed. Kṛṣṇa
knew that all this was due to illusory powers and kept cool.
He broke his car and cut off his head.<sup>1</sup> Attained mokṣa by
hatred of Kṛṣṇa.<sup>2</sup>
