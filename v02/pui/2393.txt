{%Kaṇḍu%} (I)¦ — a sage engaged in austerities on the banks
of the Gomatī; had a daughter through Pramlocā who aban-
doned the child in the midst of trees and departed. Soma
nourished it with nectar, and trees looked after her as their
baby. To get rid of the sin Kaṇḍu entered the temple of
Puruṣottama and meditated on Keśava.
