{%Sāmba%} (I)¦ — a son of Kṛṣṇa and Jāmbavatī; reincarna-
tion of Guha;<sup>1</sup> attended Aniruddha's marriage at Bhojakaṭa,
went with the Vṛṣṇi army to Bāṇa's city and fought with the
son of Bāṇa;<sup>2</sup> went out to play and saw a huge lizard in a
well and reported it to Kṛṣṇa;<sup>3</sup> took Lakṣmaṇā, daughter of
Duryodhana in a svayamvara. The Kurus imprisoned him.
Afraid of Balarāma's prowess, was released by Duryo-
dhana and was given dowry. Went to Dvārakā after the
Rājasūya of Yudhiṣṭhira and defended the city against Śālva.<sup>4</sup>
Went to Syamantapañcaka for the solar eclipse.<sup>5</sup> Went with
Kṛṣṇa's sacrificial horse. Fought with Pradyumna at Pra-
bhāsa.<sup>6</sup> Disguised as a pregnant lady by Yadu youths for fun,
approached a sage and asked him whether she would deliver a
male child. In anger the sage said that she would give birth
to a {%musala%} (iron rod) which would be death to the Yadu kula.
Divested of his attire, the {%musala%} was seen; causing distress
to the Yadus. The king ordered that it must be powdered
and thrown into the deep. A bit that was left unpowdered
was swallowed by a fish which was caught by a fisherman.
The latter fixed it at the tip of his arrow. The particles of
the {%musala%} were thrown ashore and grew to be {%eraka%} grass.<sup>7</sup>
Adopted by Gaṇḍūṣa; had five sons, all warriors, through
Kāśī; one of the five vamśavīras;<sup>8</sup> married Kaśyā, daughter of
Supārśva, and mother of Pañcavīras and a number of sons, all
with divine sparks;<sup>9</sup> was looked upon with love by the 16000
[Page3-587+ 25]
women of Kṛṣṇa and hence they were cursed by Kṛṣṇa to
be robbed and dishonoured by robbers. They were rid of
the curse by observing {%anaṅgadāna vratam%} as prescribed by
Dālbhya, the sage.<sup>10</sup> Got killed in the Yādava struggle at Pra-
bhāsa.<sup>11</sup>
