{%Citraketu%} (V)¦ — a Sārvabhauma and king of Śūrasenas.
His queen was Kṛtādyuti; though he had a number of wives
he had no children. When he was brooding over this, there
came the sage Angiras; getting to know his mind he per-
formed a ritual in honour of Tvaṣṭā and the remnant of offer-
ing was given to his eldest queen, Kṛtādyutī, who brought
forth a son. Though the king was glad, his wives grew
jealous and poisoned the child to death. The king, queen
and others ceaselessly lamented. On this Angiras and
Nārada came on the scene and consoled them. Angiras
addressed him on the instability of life, illustrating it by the
story of Bhoja. Nārada instructed him into a {%mantropa-%}
{%niṣad.%} By meditating on this for seven nights, he was told,
that he would see Sankarṣana and get over the illusion relat-
ing to duality. So he had his purificatory bath at the Jamunā
and was initiated into the {%vidyā%} by Nārada. By meditating
for seven days, the king became the lord of Vidyādharas. He
then praised Hari in the form of Ananta and had a {%darśan%}
of the Lord.
<div n="P"/>Once he flew in the air and saw Śiva sitting with Pār-
vatī on his lap in the presence of his attendants and others.
He laughed at this, which enraged Pārvatī who cursed him
to be born an Asura. Citraketu alighted from his aerial car
and begged for pardon. After he went away, Śiva told Pār-
[Page1-603+ 27]
vatī that Citraketu was a devotee of Hari, and hence his
devotee also. Therefore he deserved pardon. Pārvatī was
appeased, and Citraketu was born as Vṛtra.
