{%Purañjana%} (I)¦ — a King of extensive learning, had a
friend whose name and behaviour were not known; went
in search of a suitable place for the realisation of various
pleasures; this he found in a city of nine entrances resembling
[Page2-345+ 38]
Bhogavatī on the southern side of the Himālayas. By
accident he met a charming lady protected by a serpent and
followed by a number of ladies and men; moved by her
charms he requested her to be his wife and she agreed;
For a hundred years they continued to enjoy pleasures;
Purañjana used to visit the kingdoms, Vibhrājita, Saurabha,
Dakṣiṇa and Uttara Pāñcālas, Grāmaka, Vaiśasa and others
through the different entrances of the city guarded by the
Superintendent; influenced by her charms he came com-
pletely under her control; mad with desire for hunting,
once he left his queen and went to the forest and after
killing many a game, he returned home and desired to meet
the queen whom he found lying on the bare ground in
misery; he consoled her and once more yielded to her love
and influence at the cost of his youth; he had 1100 sons and
110 daughters for whom he found worthy wives and
suitable bridegrooms; he was then engaged in animal sacri-
fices, when the followers of Caṇḍavega, a Gandharva, attack-
ed the city of Purañjana and the Superintendent defended
it single-handed for 100 years. This placed the citizens and
the kinsmen in misery.
<div n="P"/>A daughter of Kāla, once in the company of Pūru went
to Bhaya, the Lord of the Yavanas to marry him; he adopted
her as his sister; with her and his brother Prajvāra he set
out to wander in the world; in his tour the Yavanas attack-
ed the city of Purañjana; Prajvāra burnt it down; Purañ-
jana was seized and taken to the Yavana camp; the sacrificial
animals tore him to pieces; was born as the daughter of
Vidarbha Rājasimha; married by Malayadhvaja Pāṇḍya
and gave birth to a daughter and seven sons, all kings of the
Drāviḍa country. When the Pāṇḍya left for penance she
went with him and served him; she wailed at his death; and
when about to give up her own life, a Brahmana who called
himself her friend consoled her by saying that he and she
were once the two Hamsas of Mānasa and that she took to
a household life and underwent all miseries; instructed thus
she recollected her old status and remained calm;<sup>1</sup> an allegory

for {%Jīva%} and {%Paramātman;%} Pāñcālas are the five senses while
the nine entrances to the city refer to the nine {%dvāras%} of the
body; sometimes the {%Jīva%} is a male sometimes a female, and
sometimes God, and sometimes man or beast in accordance
with Karma.<sup>2</sup>
