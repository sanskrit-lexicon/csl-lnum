{%Saubhāgyam%}¦ — when {%pralaya%} went up to the mahar-
lokam and when the whole world was overwhelmed by
{%ahamkāra%} there was a dispute between Brahmā and Kṛṣṇa
when out of the latter's chest a light in the shape of a Linga
came out. It was drunk by Dakṣa son of Brahmā and the
result was the birth of Satī. The rest of {%rasa%} became eight-
fold, seven substances bringing fortune and salt.
