{%Rāma%}¦ (III) ({%Paraśurāma%}) — a son of Jamadagni and
Reṇukā; an {%amśa%} of Hari. Heard from his father that
Arjuna-Haihaya had taken Kāmadhenu against his wish,
and getting angry went to Haihaya's capital, cut off the
king's head and took back the cow. In order to get rid of
the sin of killing a king, he went on {%tīrthayātra%} for a year.<sup>1</sup>
In obedience to his father's command he killed his mother
and brothers. This pleased the father and by his boon to
his son, they all came back to life. During his absence, the
sons of Haihaya killed his father, and on his return, found
his mother crying over the death of Jamadagni. He took
his axe, ran to Māhiṣmatī, rooted out all the Kṣatriyas by
defeating them twenty-one times; with their blood he made
nine pools at Syamantapañcaka, where he worshipped his
father's dead body and distributed the various regions to
the priests; ended it with {%avabhṛta%} in the {%Sarasvatī.%}<sup>2</sup> He
would be a great sage in the forthcoming {%manvantara.%} A
sage of the 8th {%manvantara.%} Even today resides in Mahen-
dra contemplating on Hari;<sup>3</sup> was invited for the Rājasūya of
Yudhiṣṭhira and came to see Kṛṣṇa at Syamantapañcaka.<sup>4</sup>
In his early years, with the leave of his parents, he visited
his grand parents Ṛcīka and Satyavatī; and after some stay
there, called on his great grandfather Bhṛgu, who advised
[Page3-076+ 34]
him to do {%tapas%} in the Himālayas in honour of Śiva. Engaged
in {%tapas%} by standing in water in the winter and on the fire
in summer, by means of Padmāsana; Śiva in hunter's guise
visited him and asked him to quit his place. Suspecting
him to be god, Rāma, appealed to him when Śiva showed
his true form. Instructed by Śiva, he went round the
earth on a pilgrimage tour. Helped the Devas in routing the
Asuras; continued his {%tapas%} by worshipping Śiva as mṛga-
vyādha. Pleased, the Lord instructed him in the {%astra-%}
{%grāma%} in its four aspects; went to Brahmā for advice before
he started on his crusade against the Kṣatriyas. Advised
to meet Śiva and to get initiated into {%Kṛṣṇamantra kavacam;%}
Śiva instructed him with {%Trailokya vijayam mantram.%} On
his way back he stayed at Puṣkara and heard a male deer
narrating the story of Paraśurāma and Akṛtavraṇa to the
female deer, adding that his was not the {%uttama bhakti%} but
the {%madhyama.%} He took the hint from that conversation
that he would achieve his end by Agastya's grace. Rāma
repaired to the hermitage of Agastya, followed by the deer.<sup>5</sup>
Mūlaka afraid of;<sup>6</sup> a Brāhmaṇa;<sup>7</sup> a slayer of the Kṣatriyas;
versed in Dhanurveda;<sup>8</sup> equal in prowess to Indra resplend-
ent and a mixture of Brahma and Kṣatra;<sup>9</sup> consort Dharanī.<sup>10</sup>
