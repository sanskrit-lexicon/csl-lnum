{%Yakṣa%} (I)¦ — a Rākṣasa and a son of Khaśā. As he
wanted to eat his own mother, he got the name of Yakṣa;
of four hands and four feet, a fearful figure wandering in the
night in search of prey; took the form of Vasuruci and lived
with the apsaras Krathusthalā in Nandana; she bore him a
son Rajatanābha; went home in the Himālayas with the son,
when Krathusthalā came to know of his birth as a Rākṣasa.
