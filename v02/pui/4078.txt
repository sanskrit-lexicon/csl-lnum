{%Gayāsura%}¦ — had a stone over his head on which Brahmā
performed sacrifices; Gaya performed yāga in Śvetakalpa-
vārāha; after him the name for the place; the son who goes
to Gayā, he who resides at Gayā for three pakṣas

purifies seven descendants; or residence at least for 15, 7
or 3 days; one offers piṇḍa with {%tila%} to forefathers and to
oneself; the four heinous offences are expiated with the
ritual at Gayā.
<div n="P"/>Out of the navel of Viṣṇu came Brahmā who created
Asuras one of whom was Gaya, 125 yojanas in length and
60 in breadth; a Vaiṣnava; performed {%tapas%} at Kolāhala hill
for 1000 of years;<sup>1</sup> all gods went to Viṣṇu. Gayāsura
with whom Viṣṇu was pleased was granted his request, to
be the best of all; Yamapuri became vacant; all went to
Brahmā and he went to Viṣṇu; on the latter's advice Brahmā
went to Gayā and wanted to perform yāga on his body; a
true devotee, Gaya agreed readily. But finding him un-
stable Brahmā ordered Dharma to place a stone on his head
and the devas to stand to maintain balance; Viṣnu was again
approached who gave his mūrti and finding Gaya still un-
stable Gadādhara himself took his stand and made the stone
motionless. Pleased, Viṣṇu gave him what he desired. It
was that they should all live there and that the people who
did rites there must reach Brahmaloka. See Gayā tīrtham.
