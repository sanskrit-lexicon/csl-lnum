{%Prahlāda%} (I)¦ — (also Prahrāda): son of Hiraṇyakaśipu
and Kayādhu, a dānavī;<sup>1</sup> a devotee and attendant of Hari; of
Narasimha and Kṛṣṇa in Harivarṣa,<sup>2</sup> Lord of the Daityas and
Dānavas;<sup>2a</sup> most righteous of Hiraṇyakaśipu's sons, a Mahā-
bhāgavata and a Mahātma,<sup>3</sup> Dattātreya was a tutor: Saṇḍa
and Marka, sons of Śukra, were his tutors to teach him
kingly policy and Trivarga;<sup>4</sup> served as calf for the Asuras
to milk liquor from the earth;<sup>5</sup> one of the twelve, who knew
the {%dharma%} ordained by Hari;<sup>6</sup> at the repeated tests of his
father he spoke of the nine ways of devotion to Hari; was
ordered to be killed, by being trodden by elephants, or to be
done to death by poison, fire or water; all these were of no
avail; he was then bound by noose; Prahlāda once lectured
to his playmates and classmates on the importance of devo-
[Page2-435+ 36]
tion to Hari even from childhood as it is rare to be born a
man, and even as a man one half of the life is wasted in
sleep and one quarter in old age; once one got into the
groove of {%samsāra%} it was not possible to get out of it; so he
asked them to aim at knowledge following the pure {%Bhāga-%}
{%vata Dharma;%} asked by the Daitya boys how and when he
got that knowledge, he narrated how when his father went
out to Mandara for penance, his mother was taken captive by
Indra who set her at liberty on the advice of Nārada, who
kept her in custody until his father's return. As she was
pregnant she prayed to the sage for the welfare of the child
in the womb; thus he earned the grace of Nārada. He there-
fore looked upon {%ātman%} as the only thing eternal and all
other things unreal; to attain Hari there were several ways,
such as listening to his stories, or singing his praise; {%samsāra%}
and other objects of desire were to be discarded and any-
body of any caste or creed could attain salvation by worship-
ping Hari; when this was reported to his father by the tutor,
Prahlāda was sent for and threatened with death if he
persisted in his devotion to Hari. Prahlāda was defiant in
the sabhā of Hiraṇyakaśipu; found in Narasimha the Lord
Vāsudeva and spoke to those in the sabhā, but in vain; tak-
ing up his sword Hiraṇyakaśipu asked him to show Hari at
the post near by which he knocked with his fist; out came
Narasimha and destroyed Hiraṇyakaśipu in the midst of
portents; universal rejoicing and praise of Hari; the Gods
found Narasimha still raging in anger and requested
Prahlāda to praise Him; his praise; pleased, the Lord prompt-
ed him to ask for boons; Prahlāda said that desires were
the seeds of {%samsāra%} and therefore he did not want them;
he only wanted to be ever devoted to him; Narasimha asked
him to be king and at the same time be devoted to him; and
when the time came for him he could cast off his body and
get himself merged into Hari; then Prahlāda requested for
the pardon and purification of his father which were grant-
ed; after the funeral ceremonies of his father, Prahlāda
[Page2-436+ 55]
became king; then he worshipped Brahmā, Śiva and other
Gods who all blessed him; obliged to Viṣṇu;<sup>7</sup> father of
Āyuṣmān, Śibi, Bāṣkala and Virocana;<sup>8</sup> Indra afraid of;<sup>9</sup>
a boon to Prahlāda not to kill any of his race;<sup>10</sup> praise of by
Bali who belonged to his family; arrived when Bali bound
by ropes was addressing Hari; and was bowed to by him;
addressed Hari; Kṛṣṇa who had promised Prahlāda not to
slay princes of his line allowed Bāṇa to escape; blessings to
Bali;<sup>11</sup> his request to Hari before leaving for Sutala; left
Sutala or the great cave; attained final release by {%satsanga.%}<sup>12</sup>

Brahmā was purohita to God incarnate,<sup>19</sup> made the 16 gifts,<sup>20</sup>
asked by Bali why the Asuras lost their effulgence Prah-
lāda found out by Yoga the Lord in the womb of Aditi and
predicted evil to the Asuras; Bali pooh-poohed and spoke
of his prowess. Prahlāda prediceted that he would be ruined
with his kingdom for having insulted the Lord.<sup>21</sup> Indra of
the Asuras<sup>22</sup> of the Vitalam;<sup>23</sup> Maitreya's question on the
