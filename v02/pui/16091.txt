{%Sudakṣiṇa%}¦ — the son of Pauṇḍraka: King of Kāmbhojas:
attacked with Jarāsandha the western gate of Mathurā, and
the eastern gate of Gomanta, performed funeral rites to his
father. In order to take vengeance on Kṛṣṇa, he worshipped
Śiva who directed him to pray to Dakṣiṇāgni out of which
would spring up an {%abhicāra%} fire which would kill Kṛṣṇa.
He did so but the Agni was not able to meet Kṛṣṇa's cakra
and returned only to kill Sudakṣiṇa himself.
