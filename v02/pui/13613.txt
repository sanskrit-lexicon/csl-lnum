{%Vedhas%} (III)¦ — a name of Brahmā<sup>1</sup> (s.v.). He created
a daughter Śatarūpā (Sāvitrī); she was so charming
that he himself fell in love with her; her brothers like
Vasiṣṭha and she herself deplored the absurdity of a father
marrying his daughter; the creator turned a deaf ear and all
his attention became centred on her; to see her wherever
she was he created more eyes on all his five faces; after order-
ing his sons to take up the work of creation, he lived with
Śatarūpā for years in the midst of the lotus flower unseen by
others, like an ordinary human being. To him was born
Manu Svāyambhuva also known as Virāṭ and Ādipuruṣa;
from him were born the Vairāja devas and others;<sup>2</sup> grand-
father of all the worlds.<sup>3</sup>
