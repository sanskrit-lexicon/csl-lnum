{%Dvivida%} (II)¦ — a Vānara friend of Naraka; a minister
of Sugrīva and brother of Mainda; wanted to avenge his
friend's death; went about destroying Ānartas and cities
belonging to Kṛṣṇa and met Rāma at the Raivata hill. There
he offended him by grinning, breaking his wine pot and
insulting his fair companions. This resulted in battle in
which after a bold stand Dvivida fell dead.
