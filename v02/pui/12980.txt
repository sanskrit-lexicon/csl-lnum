{%Vibhāvarī%} (IV)¦ — the Goddess of Night: invoked by
Brahmā to enter into Umā's body until she should be able
to beget Guha. By so doing, the Night could get an
{%amśa%} of the Devī and will be praised as Devī. She went to
Menā, entered her eyes when the latter gave birth to Umā
early in the morning; then entered Umā after her penance;
hence dark in colour; Brahmā asked the goddess to go with
the lion to the Vindhyas and reside there.
