{%Musala%} (II)¦ — a weapon of Śeṣa;<sup>1</sup> to exterminate all the
Yādavas by the curse of sages; came out of Sāmba's womb
which was powdered and thrown into the sea; a piece was
devoured by a fish, and a hunter who got it, shot it against
Kṛṣṇa sitting, little knowing that he was the Lord; it was
the cause of the Lord departing to heaven; other pieces
became kuśa grass which became in the hands of the
Yādavas iron sticks with which they struck one another and
died.<sup>2</sup>
