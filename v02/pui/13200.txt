{%Viśvacakram%}¦ — a gift; a wheel of the world in gold
(20 palas to 1000) with Jalaśāyi Viṣṇu and His {%avatārs,%} the
sages, the four Vedas, the Pañca Bhutās, the Rudras and the
Lokapālās placed thereon; to be given as a gift on an auspi-
cious day; daily worship of the {%cakra%} yields one plenty of
wealth and long life.
