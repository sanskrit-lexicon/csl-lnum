{%Cāṇūra%}¦ — an Asura friend of Kamsā, and a wrestler.
Ready for a match with Kṛṣṇa and Rāma, he took his seat
in the arena and invited the brothers for a match. Kṛṣṇa's
challenge, and the concern of the citizens at the unequal
match between a child and a trained athlete. After a pro-
longed fight, Cāṇūra fainted and fell dead like Indradhvaja.
