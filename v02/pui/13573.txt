{%Vedas%}¦ — First came {%nāda%} from the Supreme Brahman,
then {%Omkāra%} and then {%mantropaniṣad.%} Brahmā created
Akṣaras, and out of his four mouths appeared the four Vedas,
which were taught to his sons. This was handed down by
tradition through the ages.<sup>1</sup> Originally one, rearranged by
Vyāsa into four Samhitās — Ṛg, Yajus, Sāman and Atharvan:
distribution among his pupils done by Kṛṣṇadvaipāyana with
the help of Paila, Jaimini, Sumantu, and Vaiśampāyana:
growth of Śākhās. Lost in a deluge. Then Hari. taught
them to Brahmā who taught in his turn to his sons. A three
fold division of the Vedas conveys the truth of Brahman
and Ātman. In these Hari manifests himself: its metres are
Gāyatrī, Uṣṇik and so on.<sup>2</sup> Symbolised by Garuḍa: do not
shine in Kali.<sup>3</sup> Personified: These with Upavedas came to
see the Trivikrama form of Hari.<sup>4</sup> Learnt by Balarāma and
Kṛṣṇa.<sup>5</sup> Twenty-eight Vedavyāsas rearranged them in the
28 periods: compiled into four by Parāśara's son, originally
one;<sup>6</sup> served as vessel for Bṛhaspati to milk the cow-earth;<sup>7</sup>
restored by Matsya after deluge.<sup>8</sup>
