{%Agni%} (X)¦ — (Bhūtapati) one Agni made into three by
Aila to attain the Gandharva loka in the Tretāyuga. The
Gandharvas presented him with a pot of Agni which he took
to his city to perform sacrifices. He placed it on the Araṇi
when an Aśvattha appeared to his surprise. When Aila
informed Gandharvas the latter asked him to turn the
Aśvattha thrice and get three fires with which to sacrifice.
