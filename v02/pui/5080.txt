{%Jarāsandha%} (I)¦ — born to Bṛhadratha in two parts and
cast away by the mother. Jarā (s.v.) joined them together,
saying in sport ‘Live, Live’. It was Jarāsandha. He was
father of Sahadeva.<sup>1</sup> King of Magadha and father-in-law of
Kamśā who married his daughters Asti and Prāpti; acted as
Kamśā's guru in his wicked plans. Heard of Kamśā's death
from his widowed daughters and resolved to destroy all
the Yādavas. He besieged Mathurā with twenty-three {%akṣau-%}
{%hinis,%} stationing at the four gates king of Kalinga and
others. Drums were sounded as a call to arms. Told Kṛṣṇa
that he was a boy unfit to fight him and asked Rāma to meet
him in battle. Rāma challenged him on the western gate.
Finding all his army followers killed, Jarāsandha attacked
Rāma. When the latter was about to bind him with ropes,
Kṛṣṇa asked that he be set free. Jarāsandha went home
greatly distressed. Three months after, Jarāsandha collected
[Page1-640+ 46]
another huge army of twenty-three {%akṣauhinis,%} encamped at
Yamunā banks and slept that night. Kṛṣṇa divided his
army into three divisions and attacked the enemy on all
sides by surprise. All Jarāsandha's followers took to flight
leaving all their belongings which were presented to Ugra-
sena.
<div n="P"/>Then he called on Bāṇa at his city Śoṇitapura soliciting
his help against the Yadus. Bāṇa's welcome and offer to help;
with this force he again besieged Mathurā. Fight between
him and Rāma. Defeat of Kumbhāṇḍa and retreat of Kūpa-
karṇa and other soldiers of Bāṇa to their city. Jarāsan-
dha's return to the city.<sup>2</sup>
<div n="P"/>Felt angry at Śṛgāla's end and led another expedition
to Mathurā. Defeat and return. In this way he led seven-
teen expeditions. During the eighteenth expedition a cer-
tain Yavana sent by Nārada besieged the city.<sup>3</sup> Jarāsandha
attacked the Yadus going to Dvārakā after vanquishing the
{%mlecchas%} by the formation of {%Makaravyūha%} when Kṛṣṇa
destroyed it by throwing a big tree on it. Rāma also gave
them mighty blows. Then he turned upon two brothers who
were unarmed and who ran to Pravarṣaṇa hill. Jarāsandha
followed them and burnt the hill by besieging it from all
sides. The brothers leaped into the plains and regained
Dvārakā, but were taken by their enemies to be burnt dead.
His defeat at Kṛṣṇa's hands during the {%svayamvara%} of Ruk-
miṇī is mentioned. Arrival at Kuṇḍina; went to Śiśupāla
and comforted him that all was due to fate, and returned to
his city.<sup>4</sup> His defeats were recalled by Kṛtavarman.<sup>5</sup> He
had his capital at Girivraja, where thousands of kings were
kept imprisoned.<sup>6</sup> A preliminary to Yudhiṣṭhīra's {%rājasūya%}
was to kill Jarāsandha. Finding him unconquered and also
devoted to Brahmaṇas, Kṛṣṇa, Bhīma and Arjuna went to
him in Brahmana's guise and asked for meals. Jarāsandha
understood them to be Kṣatriyas and still recalled Bali giv-
ing the earth to Hari in a Brahmana's guise. So he offered
to give his head. Then Kṛṣṇa and his two friends revealed
themselves and invited him to battle. He refused to fight a
[Page1-641+ 25]
coward who left Mathurā for a sea-girt-city, nor with un-
equal Arjuna. But he agreed to fight with Bhīma. Then
battle continued for 27 days and Bhīma felt despondent.
Kṛṣṇa gave him a hint by tearing a twig behind. So Bhīma
pulled him down and tore him to two pieces from head to
foot.<sup>7</sup> One of those who failed to hit the fish in the {%svayam-%}
{%vara%} of Lakṣmaṇā.<sup>8</sup>
