{%Śatadhanus%} (III)¦ — a king of yore; his wife Śaivyā, a
woman of piety; both worshipped Janārdhana; after fasting on
the Kārttika full moon day and bath in the Bhāgīrathī, they
met a heretic, a friend of the king's military preceptor; he talk-
ed to him but she looked at the sun; soon the king died and she
ascended the funeral pyre; for the sin of talking to a heretic
he was born as a dog in Vidiśa and his wife as a daughter
of the king of Kāśī; she had a knowledge of her former birth
and accepted the dog for her husband; when the dog remem-
bered his former condition, he fell dead in a forest and was
born as a jackal in the Kolāhala hill; the daughter of the king
of Kāśī repaired to the mountain when he remembered his
previous birth and was born as a wolf; again the daughter
of the king of Kāśī met him; remembering his former state
he was born as a vulture, crow and a peacock; when she
bathed him during the sacrificial bath of Janaka he was born
as the son of Janaka. Then a svayamvara was held, she
married him, lived as his queen and attained heaven. See
Śaivyā.
