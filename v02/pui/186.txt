{%Acchodā%} (I)¦ — the mind-born daughter of Barhiṣada
pitṛs. After her name was the Acchoda lake. Without
finding her own Pitṛs, she took as her Pitṛ, another (Amā-
vasu) and consequently lost her yogic powers. Then seeing
her Pitṛs in the form of Trasareṇu, she prayed to them for
succour. They said that she would be born on the earth
on the 28th Dvāpara as the daughter of Matsya and marry
Śantanu and be mother of two seers — Vicitravīrya as well
as of king Citrāṅgada. Afterwards she would attain
the {%aṣṭaka%} place in the Pitṛ world. As the daughter of the
fisherman, she was known as Satyavatī and Matsyagandhi.<sup>1</sup>
