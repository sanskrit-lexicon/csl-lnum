{%Amṛtotpādanam%}¦ (see {%Amṛtam%}) — suggested by Hari-
Ajita to secure immortality for gods. It was to churn the
{%kṣīroda%} with Mandara as stick and Vāsuki as rope. The
Asuras agreed to aid the gods in securing {%Amṛta.%} Hari took
hold at first of the head, and when the Asuras protested, of
the tail of Vāsuki. Seeing exhaustion on the part of gods
owing to obstacle of Vighneśa, Hari propped up the Mandara
hill, assuming the form of a tortoise. With continuous effort,
the churning went on. First appeared {%Hālāhala%} which was
consumed by Śiva on an appeal from the Prajāpatis and with
the permission of Pārvatī. Then came out {%Kāmadhenu%} which
sages appropriated for agnihotra; {%Uccaiśśravas,%} a horse which
Bali took; then {%Airāvata: Kaustubha%} gem appropriated by
Hari, then {%Pārijāta, Apsaras%} women and then {%Srī%} married to
Hari. Then came out {%Vāruṇīdevī%} whom Asuras seized, then
Dhanvantari with a pot of {%Amṛta.%} There was then a rush on
both sides to get the {%Amṛta%} first when Hari assumed the
form of {%Mohinī%} and arrested their attention. Moved by her
beauty, both gods and Asuras agreed to let her distribute the
{%Amṛta%} to all of them. She began with the gods and was
serving them first. Noticing this {%Rāhu%} took the guise of a
god. On being pointed out by the sun and moon, Hari cut
off his head with his {%Cakra.%} The Asuras found that they
had been deluded by Hari and set their face against Him.
