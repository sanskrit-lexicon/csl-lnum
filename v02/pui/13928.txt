{%Śakrajit%} (I)¦ — a son of Nighna; to him the sun was a
great companion; once he visited him and wanted to see his
form; for this the sun handed over Syamantaka the best of
gems wearing which he saw his form distinctly; it was so
beautiful that he desired to keep the gem himself to which
the sun agreed; then he returned to his city with the jewel;
he shone like the sun himself and entered the harem to the
wonderment of his people.<sup>1</sup> Śakrajit received back the {%maṇi%}
from Vāsudeva; he had 100 sons by his ten wives; of these
three were famous, Bhangakāra, Vratapati and Apasvān.<sup>2</sup>
