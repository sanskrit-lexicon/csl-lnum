{%Bāhu%} (II)¦ — a son of Dhṛtaka (Vṛka-{%Vi. P.%}); was
attacked and deprived of his kingdom by the Haihayas and
the Tālajanghas with the help of the Śakas, Yavanas, Kām-
bojas, Pāradas, and Palhavas, the five tribes; hence the king
abdicated and took to a life of penance with his wife in the
forest as an old man. Once he went to bring water when
he slipped into the waters and died; his wife Yādavī followed
him though she was in the family way; she had been
poisoned by her co-wife to prevent pregnancy; she got into
the funeral pyre. Aurva, the Bhārgava withdrew her from
the fire; she was in his {%āśrama%} and brought forth Sagara
(Saha Gara).
