{%Aṣṭāvakra%}¦ — a sage crooked in eight parts of the body;
was performing penances with his body below the neck
under waters. The nymphs who went to Merupṛṣṭa to see
a festival beheld him and hymned him; pleased he asked
them their wish. “Puruṣottama for husband” they said.
He agreed and when he came out of waters, seeing his form
they laughed at him. Insulted, he imprecated that they
would be the wives first of Puruṣottama and then fall into
the hands of robbers. They prayed fervently and he said
that they would attain heaven afterwards.
