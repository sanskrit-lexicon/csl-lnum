{%Kāliya%} (I)¦ — a chief of the Krodhavaśa group of ser-
pents. Got into a pool of the Yamunā, causing the death
of people who drank of the waters. Kṛṣṇa subjugated it
and ordered it to go to the sea, thus making the waters
drinkable. He assured Kālīya of freedom from Garuḍa's
hostility. Son of Kadru, Kāliya originally lived in Rama-
ṇaka, and refused to give Bali to Garuḍa according to an
agreement with him. In the fight that ensued, Kāliya was
vanquished, and he resorted to the Kālindi pool where
Garuḍa could not come. But he was expelled by Kṛṣṇa.<sup>1</sup>
