{%Yamunā%} (II)¦ — (personified) sister of Yama. Once
Balarāma invited her for watersports, and got enraged at
her delay. Hence he dragged her by means of his plough
through Bṛṇdāvan. This changed her course; then she
prayed for mercy which was granted. She presented Rāma
with clothes and jewels. Even now the change in the
course is noticeable.
