{%Indrayāga%}¦ — performed every year by Nanda and other
gopas to please Indra, the Lord of rains and hence conducive
to {%Trivarga.%} Kṛṣṇa explained that rain was the work of
nature, and that no credit went to Indra. So he persuaded
them to worship cows, Brāhmaṇas and hills. So it hap-
pened. Indra who was thus deprived of his {%bali%} grew wrath-
ful and sent down a continuous heavy downpour of rain
creating panic in the minds of gopas. Kṛṣṇa took hold of
the hill Govardhana and held it aloft as an umbrella steadily
for seven days. Astonished at this, Indra withdrew his
rains and Govardhana was planted in its place.
