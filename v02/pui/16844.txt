{%Saubhāgyaśayanam%}¦ — in honour of Umā; to be begun
on Vasanta Śukla tritīyā and continued for a year
every tritīyā when Satī married Śiva; after purificatory
baths, offer prayers to Umā and also to Śiva in the midst
of the eight saubhāgyas by flowers, incense, etc.; at the
end a gift of a bed is prescribed; the performer gets desired
things and ultimately reaches heaven; he who does it for
12 years, or 7 or 8 lives a happy long life. Madana, Sata-
dhanva, Kārtavīrya, Varuṇa and Nandi have done this.
