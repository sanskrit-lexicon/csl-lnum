{%Vajra%} (III)¦ — a thief of Kāñcī stole bit by bit from the
city and stored the riches in a secret place in the neighbour-
ing woods. A certain kirāta gathering fuel for sale observed
this once and took a portion of the property home. His
wife, charitably disposed, wanted to utilise it for digging
[Page3-137+ 29]
wells and ponds. So a pond was constructed but before it was
completed, all money had been spent. He got more of the
thief's wealth and completed the embankment; built temples
of Śiva and Viṣṇu, besides giving gifts to Brāhmaṇas who
were pleased and renamed him and his wife as Dvijavarma
and Śīlāvatī: He also built a town and named it after his
Purohita, Devarāta. At his death, as he built all out of
stolen wealth Nārada ruled that he should wander in air
for 12 years, while his wife went to Brahmaloka. As she
refused, she was advised to recite {%Śatarudra%} and get her
husband released from the sin of theft. When Vajra died
he got half of Dvijavarman's virtue. Dvijavarman attained
Kailāsa.
