of Hari; (also Baladeva, Balabhadra, Sīrāyudha); the
{%Dhāma%} of Hari in the womb of Devakī transferred to that
of Rohiṇī by Yogamāyā; on account of this he is Sankar-
ṣaṇa; also Rāma on account of his pleasant personality and
Bala on account of his strength; his {%nāmakaraṇam;%}<sup>1</sup>
was bewildered at Baka seizing Kṛṣṇa; became glad at
his escape; entered the palmyra grove, vanquished the Asura
Dhenuka and his kin and gladdened the cow-herds; advised
Nanda and others to keep cool when Kṛṣṇa was enclosed in
the coils of the reptile, and stopped their getting into the
pool of Kālīya; his joy at Kṛṣṇa's escape from Kālīya; was
carried by Pralamba on his back when he won in a certain
game; but finding him to be an Asura in the guise of a
gopa, he knocked his head with his fist and killed
him for which the Devas praised him;<sup>2</sup> his surprise
at Kṛṣṇa's holding aloft the Govardhana; was in
charge of the women rescued by Kṛṣṇa from Śankha-
cūḍa and was presented with the Cūḍāmaṇi of Śankhacūḍa.<sup>3</sup>

<div n="P"/>When the Yadus decided war with the Kurus, Rāma
did not like it and thought he could bring about peace; went
to Hastinagara and was welcomed by Duryodhana and
others; he communicated to them Ugrasena's command to
release Sāmba; the Kurus laughed and said that slippers
would sometimes usurp the place of crown; Ugrasena was
only a king by sufferance and hence he could not send a
command; enraged at their inordinate pride, he decided to
lift up the city and throw it into the Ganges; the Kurus
prayed for mercy and promised to send Lakṣmaṇā with
Sāmba together with a large dowry of horses, elephants,
etc.; with these Rāma returned to Dvārakā;<sup>6</sup> was con-
sulted by Kṛṣṇa; Kṛṣṇa took leave of him to go to
Hastināpura; did not like the war between the Pāṇḍavas
and the Kauravas and went on a pilgrimage; after visiting
Prabhāsa, Sarasvatī, Yamunā, and Gangā he reached Nai-
miṣa where he was welcomed by all the sages; Romahar-
ṣaṇa the Sūta did not rise up to honour him at which Rāma
got angry and fatally hurt him; seeing this the sages called
it {%adharma%} and {%brahmahatya%} and called upon Rāma for
[Page2-465+ 41]
expiation; Romaharṣaṇa's son was blessed; the sages asked
Rāma to kill the Asura Balvala and go on a pilgrimage for
a year when he could be purified; after killing Balvala, and
