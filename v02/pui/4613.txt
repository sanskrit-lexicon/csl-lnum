{%Candragupta%} (II)¦ — the unrighteous minister of Hai-
haya who advised the king to get by peace or force the cow
of Jamadagni so that he could ever have plenty. The king
agreed and sent him to fetch the cow. Jamadagni argued
that it was intended for religious purposes. The minister,
without listening to those words had the animal bound.
Jamadagni tied himself to the cow, and being beaten fell
down dead. The cow kicked off her fetters and flew into
[Page1-584+ 29]
heaven. The minister reported the matter to the king who
returned to his city greatly dejected.
