{%Gopi%}¦ — (girls) see Kātyāyani vrata. The gopi women
were enchanted by the music of Kṛṣṇa, took to Brindāvana,
and worshipped him. By singing his glories and through
{%Kāma%} they became one with Him.<sup>1</sup> On another occasion
they were so much moved by his music that they left their
household work, children and male members and came to
Brindāvan. Though they were asked to go back they
refused, and desired to attain His feet. While they were
enjoying his presence, Kṛṣṇa suddenly disappeared. They
wandered all the forest in search of Him, addressing all trees
and plants as to his whereabouts. During all this time each
thought that every one of them was Kṛṣṇa and imitated his
boyish exploits. After vain search they came to the very
place wherefrom they started and meditated on his great-
ness. They praised him in the form of {%gītam%} looking for-
ward to his arrival. Soon he was in their midst and con-
soled them. They took part in the {%rāsa krīḍa%} where was
seen a Kṛṣṇa between every two women. They sang and
danced unconscious of the loosening of their jewels, braid
or clothes. When they sweated in fatigue, Kṛṣṇa wiped off
their sweat. They then enjoyed water-sports, and sports on
the river-banks in the {%upavana.%} By dawn they repaired to
their homes.<sup>2</sup> When some gopis were forcibly taken by
Śankha Cūda, Kṛṣṇa released them and killed him.<sup>3</sup> When
Kṛṣṇa was away in the woods, the gopis who were at homes
sang in praise of his {%veṇu gītā.%}<sup>4</sup> Gopis heard of Kṛṣṇa going
to Mathrā with Akrūra and characterised Akrūra to
be only a Krūra as he brought about Kṛṣṇa's sepa-
ration from them. They turned their minds on the past
deeds of Kṛṣṇa, and stood motionless as pictures at his leav-
[Page1-550+ 31]
ing them. Kṛṣṇa assured them of his return soon.<sup>5</sup> Uddhava
was sent by Kṛṣṇa with a message to gopis and gopas. The
gopis mistook his chariot for that of Akrūra. They all sur-
rounded him and enquired of Kṛṣṇa and his attitude towards
them. Uddhava brought relief to them by delivering Kṛṣṇa's
message while they recounted to him his deeds at Brindā-
van. Pleased at their attachment to the Lord, Uddhava took
leave of them after spending some time there.<sup>6</sup> They went
to Syamantapañcaka and met Kṛṣṇa who took them aside
and consoled them so much so that they were all in contem-
plation of Him. Left for Mathurā.<sup>7</sup> and attained salvation
by {%satsanga.%}<sup>8</sup>
