{%Bali%} (V)¦ — a son of Virocana and the grandson of Prah-
lāda;<sup>1</sup> married Vindyāvalī and Aśanā; had one hundred sons
of whom Bāṇa was the eldest; all of them were kings; king
of the Asuras;<sup>1</sup> other chief sons were Kumbhanābha, Garda-
bhākṣa, and Kuśi; two daughters were Śakunī and Pūtanā;<sup>1</sup>
carried away the crown of Hari inlaid with gems; was pur-
sued by the warder of the city, Garuḍa who recovered it
after a fight.<sup>2</sup>
<div n="P"/>Indra on the advice of Hari-Ajita sought an alliance
with him and it was concluded; they also agreed to churn
the ocean in a co-operative spirit; got exhausted in the
Amṛtamathana; appropriated Uccaiśravas which came out
of the Amṛtamathana; in the Devāsura war following the
Amṛtamathana, Bali became the commander and was riding
in an aerial car with the Asuras; finding it difficult to fight
Indra and the Gods openly he took to illusory methods by
resorting to creating fire, storms, rains, etc.; encouraged by
Hari's presence, Indra again called him to battle and Bali
fell down unconscious after a strenuous fight; taken to Asta-
giri where by Sañjīvini Vidyā, Śukra brought him back to
life; the Bhṛgu Brahmanas aided him in the completion of
his Viśvajit sacrifice and anointed him with mahābhiṣeka;
receiving gifts from all quarters Bali marched to the city of
Indra on a chariot given by Bhṛgu and besieged it; on Indra
and the Gods vacating the city on the advice of Bṛhaspati,
Bali took possession of it and performed 100 Aśvamedhas
with the aid of the Bhṛgu Brahmanas;<sup>3</sup> once Bali was
engaged in performing the Aśvamedha in the Bhṛgukaccha
on the northern bank of the Narmadā. Tither came the
Vāmana Hari in the form of a dwarf and Brahmacārin,
whom Bali welcomed and requested to accept some gift;
pleased with his speech Vāmana asked for 3 feet of ground,
and though Bali offered to give more he declined it; Śukra
knew that he was Hari and dissuaded Bali from agreeing to
his request; Bali's resolve to keep his word resulting in his
being cursed by Śukra to lose all {%Śrī;%} gift to Vāmana helped
by his wife Vindhyāvalī; Vāmana's {%viśvarūpa%} and his
[Page2-470+ 49]
measuring the Earth and Heaven by two feet; seeing the
Asuras beaten by Hari's attendants, Bali asked them not to
fight; knowing Hari's mind Garuḍa bound Bali with
Varuṇa's cords; on the sutya day of the sacrifice Bali thought
of Prahlāda; asked by Vāmana to show room for placing his
third foot, Bali was unable to find any space except his head
and was doomed to hell; Bali's prayer to Hari; Prahlāda's
arrival and prayer to the Lord; appeal of Vindyāvalī and
Brahmā; humbled by Vāmana; blessed by Hari to be the
Indra of the Sāvarṇi epoch and in the meantime king of
Sutala; attained permanent fame.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>After taking leave of Hari and praising him duly, Bali
and Prahlāda entered the cave Sutala; the lordship of the
worlds had no charm for him; moved by his devotion, Viṣṇu
once acted as his door-keeper; got the grace of Hari and
attained permanent fame and final release by {%satsaṅga;%}<sup>5</sup> a
devotee of Hari; was obliged to Viṣṇu and knew his {%yoga-%}
{%māyā;%} one of the twelve, who knew the {%dharma%} ordained
by Hari;<sup>6</sup> Parīkṣit compared to, for his courage.<sup>7</sup> His queen
was Aśanā.<sup>8</sup> A resident of Pātala;<sup>9</sup> anointed his five sons in
the seventh yuga of the Treta, and wandered unseen by
others;<sup>10</sup> a servant of Hiraṇyakaśipu.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>Bali asked Prahlāda the reason for the loss of refulgence
on the part of the Asuras; he discovered the Lord in the
womb of Aditi and spoke of his incarnation and the conse-
quent ruin of the Asuras; Bali spoke of his prowess and
insulted the Lord when Prahlāda cursed him to lose all his
kingship. He consulted Śukra as to what should be done
if the Lord should visit his {%yajña;%} Śukra said he must be
given some choice gift. The Lord appeared and wanted
space for three steps. Bali consented. The first and second
was placed in heaven and the earth and the third on his
head. The Lord asked Bali to reside in the Pātāla region
and made Indra the king of the three worlds. Bali to
occupy the place of Indra in the Sāvarṇi epoch; until then
he was to receive the gifts not given properly, ceremonies
