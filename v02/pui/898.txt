{%Alakanandā%}¦ — The R. in Kailāsa: a branch of Gaṅgā
issuing out of the city of Brahmā descends the southern
slopes of Meru. Her course can be traced from the Gan-
dhamādana. Traversing the Hemakūṭa and Himalayas as also
the continent of Bharata and dividing itself into seven
branches it enters the sea on the south. A bath in this
stream is equal to performing {%Aśvamedhas%} and other sacri-
fices. A mahānadī: borne by Śiva on his head for more
than a hundred years: Elevated Sagara's sons to heaven.
