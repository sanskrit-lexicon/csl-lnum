to Mathurā to pay the annual tribute to Kamsa; was met
by Vasudeva who advised him to leave at once for his place
as he expected some {%utpātas%} there: Nanda thinking Vasu-
deva's words to be true turned his thoughts on the way to
Hari; heard of Pūtanā, the demon killed by Kṛṣṇa and felt
greatly surprised; embraced Kṛṣṇa in joy; performed {%Śānti%}
for Kṛṣṇa for kicking the cart; was surprised at Kṛṣṇa's
taking the lap of Tṛṇāvarta and believed more and more in
Vasudeva's words; welcomed Garga and had {%nāmakaraṇa%}
done to his sons; became pleased at Garga's service;<sup>3</sup> Nanda

<div n="P"/>Prepared for the Indrayāga; but gave it up and prayed
to the mountains instead, as advised by Kṛṣṇa; Indra's anger
towards Nanda; was surprised at Kṛṣṇa holding the Govar-
dhana; when the Gopas wondered at the exploits of the boy,
Kṛṣṇa, Nanda said that he heard from Garga that he was
Vasudeva's son and an {%amśa%} of Nārāyaṇa; after fasting on
{%ekādaśi,%} Nanda went to Yamunā for bath for the {%dvādaśi;%}
it was āsura time and not the time for bath; so an Asura
follower of Varuṇa took hold of him and placed him before
Varuṇa; seeing Nanda missing, the Gopas got frightened and
appealed to Kṛṣṇa who went to Varuṇa; pleased at seeing
him Varuṇa said that it was a mistake committed by his
servants in ignorance and set Nanda free; then he returned
to Vraja to the great joy of all the Gopas; taken to Brahmah-
rada;<sup>7</sup> when once he went to Ambikāvana he was seized by
a reptile and was released with Kṛṣṇa's help.<sup>8</sup>

Kamsa; became afraid of Akrūra's message; got ready with
all the Gopas to start for Mathurā with presents to Kamsa;
followed Akrūra's chariot with all his carts and men; came
in advance and waited for Kṛṣṇa's arrival; took his seat
along with the other Gopas in the gallery of the wrestling
ground; Kamsa desired to imprison him; duly honoured by
Kṛṣṇa, Nanda and the Gopas returned to Vraja after Kamsa's
death;<sup>9</sup> welcomed Uddhava with due honour; exhibited his
deep love for Kṛṣṇa; Uddhava revealed the real nature of
Kṛṣṇa to him.<sup>10</sup>
