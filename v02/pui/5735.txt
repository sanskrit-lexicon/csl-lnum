{%Dakṣa%} (I)¦ — a Mind-born son of Brahmā, born of his
thumb, and father of Mūrti. A progenitor and guardian of
the world, born for the creation of worldly beings.<sup>1</sup> Married
Prasūtī, daughter of Svāyambhuva Manu. Had sixteen
daughters of whom he gave thirteen to Dharma, one to Agni,
one to Pitṛs, and one to Śiva.<sup>2</sup> To the Satra of Viśvasṛk
Dakṣa came and was welcomed by all standing, except
Brahmā and Śiva. On this Dakṣa burst into anger against
Śiva and insulted him saying he had eyes like a monkey, was a
breaker of law and convention, lord of the Bhūtas and Gaṇas;
he then cursed that Śiva should have no more share in sacri-
fices and went away. Nandi got enraged at this and im-
precated a curse on Dakṣa that he would lose all knowledge
of Ātman, and assuming the face of a sheep, would become
dull-witted. Bhṛgu then pronounced a counter-curse that
those propitiating Śiva shall become Pākhaṇḍas.<sup>3</sup> Appointed
by Brahmā as the overlord of all Prajāpatis, Dakṣa began
the sacrifice of Bṛhaspatisava to which all gods went in
groups. Satī also expressed her desire to go and requested
permission of Śiva, who reminded her of the insult offered to
him.<sup>4</sup> As she was persistent, she was allowed to attend.
Going, she found that she was not properly welcomed by her
father. The enraged Satī sat facing the northern direction
in yoga and cast off her body by means of the fire of Samādhī
to the distress of gods and others. On this the Gaṇa followers
of Satī attacked Dakṣa, when Bhṛgu created a class of gods,
Ṛbhus who vanquished these Gaṇas.<sup>5</sup> Having heard of all
this from Nārada, Śiva grew angry; out of his anger sprang
Vīrabhadra who was ordered to ruin Dakṣa's sacrifice. The
beard of Bhṛgu was cut off, and Dakṣa's head was severed
from his body and thrown into the Dakṣiṇāgni.<sup>6</sup> The Gods
waited upon Brahmā who proceeded to Kailāsa. He conciliat-
ed Śiva and pleaded for the revival of Dakṣa and continuation
of his {%Yajña%} promising a share to him.<sup>7</sup> Śiva agreed but
[Page2-059+ 43]
said that Dakṣa should have the face of the sheep, Bhaga,
Mitra's eye, and Bhṛgu the beard of a sheep. Agreeing to this
Brahmā went with Śiva to the sacrificial hall of Dakṣa. Now
Dakṣa began to praise Śiva. When Viṣṇu's offering was
poured to secure the continuation of the sacrifice, Viṣṇu
presented himself in person when Dakṣa, Ṛtviks, Sadasyas,
Rudra and others present, spoke in his praise. Pleased at
this, Hari remarked there was no difference among the
Trimurtīs. Dakṣa brought the {%yajña%} to a successful end.<sup>8</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%Another account.%}
{%Dakṣa%} son of Varkṣī (Māriṣā-{%Vi. P.%}) and Pracetas (Prā-
cetasaṣ-{%Vi. P.%}); a Prajāpati. He first created the Devas,
Asuras, men and others inhabiting the sky, earth
and water. Finding the creation incomplete, he went
to the Vindhyas for {%tapas%} by bathing in the Agha-
marṣaṇa and propitiating Hari with the hymn of
{%hamsaguhya.%} To him the Lord appeared and urged
him to marry Asiknī, daughter of Pañcajana and
thus increase the created beings.<sup>9</sup> Of Asiknī he begot 10,000
sons called Haryaśvas. The latter proceeded to the western
direction to the sacred lake Nārāyaṇasaras at the estuary
of the Indus. Purified by the bath and instructed by Nārada
on the bondage of Samsāra, these took to the path of ‘not
returning’ {%(anvartana).%} Dakṣa lamented and begot by the
same wife a thousand sons, Śabalāśvas. These again followed
the path trodden by their elder brothers, advised by Nārada.
The enraged Dakṣa cursed that Nārada, the corrupter
of youth, was ever to be a wanderer and to have no settled
home. The sage submitted to it without retaliating.<sup>10</sup> Con-
soled by Brahmā, Dakṣa further begot sixty daughters of
Asiknī (Vairinī-{%M. P.%}). He bestowed ten on Dharma,
twelve on Kaśyapa, twenty-seven on Soma, two each for
Bhūta, Angiras, and Kṛśāśva, and the remaining five, of
whom only four seem to be named (in v. 21) on Tārkṣyā.<sup>11</sup>
Elsewhere it is said that thirteen daughters were given in
marriage to Kaśyapa.
