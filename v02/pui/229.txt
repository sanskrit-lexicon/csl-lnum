{%Ajāmila%}¦ — an old {%itihāsa%} of. A Brāhmaṇa of Kanyā-
kubja, versed in {%śāstras%} and celebrated in {%ācāra.%} Once
when out to get {%kuśa%} grass, he saw a {%dāsī%} and fell in love.
Then he abandoned all his duties and discarded his wedded
wife. The {%dāsī%} became his wife. She bore him ten sons.
The last was named Nārāyaṇa best loved of his parents. At
[Page1-032+ 32]
the time of his death, when the messengers of Yama were
waiting to remove him to hell, he called out his last son by
his name Nārāyaṇa. On this, the messengers of Vīṣṇu were
on the scene and prevented Yama's men from taking the
Brāhman to hell. It was argued that pronouncing the name
of Hari at his death redeemed him of all his sins, and that
alone was the secret of Dharma. Yama heard this and
approved it. Ajāmila, thus rescued from Death, felt peni-
tent, and while making {%tapas%} at Gaṅgādvāra, he cast off his
body and reached {%Viṣṇuloka.%}
