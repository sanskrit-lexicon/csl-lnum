{%Abhiṣeka%}¦ — The anointing ceremony: when Puru, the
last son was recommended by Yayāti, the people said that
it was {%dharma%} to anoint the eldest; defined the law that the
faithful son alone was fit for the throne; Puru having fulfilled
his father's wishes was to be regarded the faithful and
dutiful; this was agreed to; further it was endorsed by
Śukra.
