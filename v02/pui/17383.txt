{%Hiraṇyakaśipu%} (I)¦ — a son of Ditī and Kaśyapa: reduc-
ed to subjection the three worlds with the Lokapālas: secured
heaven through his son Prahlāda. His queen was Kayādhu;<sup>1</sup>
wanted to avenge his brother Hiraṇyākṣa's death;<sup>2</sup> the six
sons born of his Asura Yoni were carried off by Yogamāyā's
effort. They were again born of Devakī and killed by
Kamsa;<sup>3</sup> lust after more territory;<sup>4</sup> in his previous birth an
attendant of Hari. He was next born as Rāvaṇa and after-
wards Caidya. Destroyed the whole world by fire and by
sword all friends of Hari for the killing of his brother, consol-
ed his wife and sons pointing to the old saying that to die at
the hands of an enemy leads one to heaven and cited the story
of Suyajña that it was no use to weep over the dead body.
Then Ditī set her mind on the truth;<sup>5</sup> Hiraṇyakaśipu began
austere penance in the Mandara hill and the fire of his
penance spread far and wide and created fear in the Devas.
Brahmā paid a visit and saw Hiraṇyakaśipu covered by an
ant hill. Sprinkling divine waters, he woke him up to see the
Lord on the Swan, and he praised His glory. He asked that
(1) he might not meet with death at the hands of any being
[Page3-770+ 43]
created by Brahmā; (2) might not meet with death inside or
outside, by day or night, by any weapon not on earth or in sky,
by men or beasts, gods or asuras; (3) he was to be without
an equal; (4) he should possess undiminishing power (5) and
be the one ruler of all creatures.<sup>6</sup> These were granted and
Hiraṇyakaśipu spread his sway on all the worlds and took up
the seat of Indra. All gods except the Triad bowed to him;<sup>7</sup>
father of four sons, chief of whom was Prahlāda whom he
hated as he was a devotee of Hari. Śukra's sons Śaṇḍa and
Marka were appointed to be his tutors to get a knowledge
of Trivarga. This only increased Prahlāda's devotion.
Hiraṇyakaśipu put it to some inborn defect of the boy. Means
to kill the child by wild beasts, poison, fire and water were
of no avail. He was bound by noose and imprisoned;<sup>8</sup> when
he was absent in Mandara hill Indra harassed his followers
and captured his queen with Prahlāda. Nārada asked
him to release her, which he did. She was under the custody
of the sage, praying to him for the birth of a good son;<sup>9</sup> in
the course of his father's (Kaśyapa's) aśvamedha sacrifice, the
child Hiraṇyakaśipu sat on one of the golden seats reserved
for Hotṛ, and hence the name. Ruled for nearly (1/4) of the
manvantara, got aurvimāyā from Aurva to dispel;<sup>10</sup> Tāmaśi-
māyā;<sup>11</sup> rivers, mountains, worlds, etc. shaken by him;<sup>12</sup> first
of Daityas, killed by Narasimha whom he never considered
as Viṣṇu;<sup>13</sup> taken out by action of Yoganidrā under orders
from Viṣṇu.<sup>14</sup>
