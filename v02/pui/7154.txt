{%Nimi%} (I)¦ — one of the elder sons of Ikṣvāku; solicited
the service of Vasiṣṭha for performing a sacrifice; Vasiṣṭha
asked Nimi to wait until he returned from Indra's sacrifice
to which he had been invited earlier. But Nimi thinking
of the mutability of things got it done with the help of other
sages; finding that Nimi had finished his sacrifice the sage
cursed ‘Let his body fall’. The king cursed the sage in
his turn and cast off his body. After preserving the body
in a balm for seven days the sages requested the gods to
restore him to life; Nimi refused to enter again the bondage
of the physical body; then the gods said, ‘let him live in the
eyelids of all living beings’. But the sages were afraid of
anarchy and churned the body of Nimi for a son and this
was Janaka Vaideha;<sup>1</sup> performed a {%satra%} at which the nine
sages, the sons of Ṛṣabha were present. These enlightened
the king on {%Bhāgavata dharma.%}<sup>2</sup> For a slightly different
version of the incident regarding the curse see {%Matsya.%}<sup>3</sup>
