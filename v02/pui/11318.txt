Dharma, and father of Prativindhya and Sudhanu. Devaka

defeated in a game of dice and was banished to the forest
with his brothers and their wife. Was met and consoled by
Kṛṣṇa and Satyabhāmā. Kṛṣṇa's respects to: heard from
Nārada that Kṛṣṇa was the Supreme Hari and was much
pleased. Enquired of Him when he met him at the city of
the Pāñcālas. He and his four brothers were met by Kṛta-
varman.<sup>2</sup> His desire to perform the Rājasūya; joy at Kṛṣṇa's
visit: provided suitable lodgings for Kṛṣṇa and his family.
Addressing of the assembly on his desire to perform the
Rājasūya, Kṛṣṇa asked him to get ready by defeating all the
kings and bringing thus all the earth under his control:
sent out his brothers in the four directions who defeated
kings and brought much wealth. Was glad of Jarāsandha's
death at the hands of his brothers: Sent for Purohitas for
the sacrifice and invited all his kith and kin. The {%yajña%}
comparable to that of Varuṇa; attended by all gods. For
doing honour to the {%Sadasyas%} there was some doubt about
the first place, and Sahadeva's suggestion of Kṛṣṇa's name
was accepted by all except Śiśupāla who insulted him in
the public assembly. Kṛṣṇa's silence. The Pāṇḍavas with
the Matsyas and others unsheathed their swords, and Kṛṣṇa
sent his {%cakra%} which cut off his head. After {%avabhṛta,%}
Yudhiṣṭhira shone like Indra. All took leave of him in
joy except Duryodhana, who became jealous of the success
of the Rājasūya and of Draupadī, and of Kṛṣṇa. Heard of
Duryodhana's fall in the {%sabhā%} and sent Kṛṣṇa with dress
and ornaments to him, which he rejected.<sup>3</sup> On the occasion

Dantavaktra, haters of Hari became merged with him after
their death, as also about {%Sanātana dharma;%}<sup>4</sup> was met by
Upaplāvya, by Kṛṣṇa and the other Yadus;<sup>5</sup> went to

[Page3-033+ 35]
the war, and left for Hāstinapura and was anointed king:
rule of righteousness.<sup>5</sup> Felt aggrieved over the slaughter of
his kith and kin: agreed with Draupadī regarding the release
of Aśvatthāma, went with his brothers to see Bhīṣma in his
death-bed, like Kubera with the Yakṣas. Requested Bhīṣma
to give him the truth of {%mokṣa dharma.%} Did the funeral rites
to him, and after returning to the capital, ruled righteously
with the approval of Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Kṛṣṇa: three {%aśva-%}
{%medhas%} were performed by him at the suggestion of Kṛṣṇa:
Missed seeing Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Gāndhārī, and learnt of their
life in the Himālayas. The rule was characterised by plenty
of rains and crops and by absence of diseases and difficul-
ties;<sup>6</sup> learnt the {%Angāravrata%} from the sage, Pippalāda;<sup>7</sup> went
to Syamantapañcaka for the solar eclipse and there met

Installed his grandson Parīkṣit on the throne and Vajra at
Mathurā: Prepared to go to {%svarga:%} Clad in bark, fasting,
and silent, he went towards north with a view to attaining

friendship.<sup>9</sup>
