{%Ila%}¦ — the eldest son of Vaivasvata Manu; born of
{%Putreṣṭi;%} anointed by Manu going to Mahendra hill for
{%tapas;%} set out for {%digvijaya,%} when he reached Śaravaṇa
gardens where Umā was sporting with {%Śiva.%} There was a
curse by which a male who entered the garden was turned
into a female. So Ila became {%Ilā.%} Bewildered Ilā was wan-
dering and was met by Budha, Soma's son. She agreed to
be his partner and followed him. Ikṣvāku and his brothers
were concerned at their missing Ila and were told by Vasiṣṭha
of his whereabouts. On Vasiṣṭha's advice, Ikṣvāku per-
formed an {%Aśvamedha,%} as the result of which Ila would be
a Kimpuruṣa for a month and Ilā for the next alternately.
As Ilā, she gave birth to Purūravas, the first of the lunar race.
In a way Ila was responsible for the two dynasties — solar
and lunar.
