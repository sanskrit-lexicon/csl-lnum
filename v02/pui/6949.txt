{%Narmadā%} (I)¦ — a mahānadi of the Bhāratavarṣa; a R.
from the Ṛkṣa or Ṛṣyavat hills: (Vindhyan ranges) on its
northern bank was Bhṛgukaccha: a sacred river that sur-
vived the {%antarakṣaya,%} sacred to Pitṛs and for śrāddha; in
the neighbourhood of the Haihaya kingdom.<sup>1</sup>
<div n="P"/>The scene of battle between Vṛtra and Indra; here
Rukmi challenged Kṛṣṇa when the latter was crossing the
stream with Rukmiṇī; its current was stopped by Kārta-
vīrya.<sup>2</sup>
<div n="P"/>The mahātmya of; just like Mārkaṇḍeya this river does
not get lost in the time of the deluge; in Kalinga, near the
Amarakaṇṭaka hill; has a number of {%tīrthas%} like Jaleśvara,
Rudrakoṭi, Amrakaṇṭaka, Kapila and Viśalya Karaṇi. The
devotee bathing in any {%tīrtha%} on the Narmadā gets the
benefit of performing an Aśvamedha sacrifice.<sup>3</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Lord enshrined here is Maheśvara who devised
plans to vanquish Bāṇāsura of Tripura with the help of
Nārada. The Lord was much concerned about virtuous
ladies in Tripura and Nārada undertook to delude them by
proclaiming ordinances to ladies to give gifts to poor and
deserving Brahmanas.<sup>4</sup> Śiva got ready for war here and
attacked Tripura with incendiary materials. Out of the
three cities comprising Tripura, (s.v.) two fell down
reduced to ashes. The first city became converted into the
Śri Śaila hill, and the second Amarakaṇṭaka hill, both
adorned by the Siddhas, Gandharvas and so on. The Lord
enshrined at the latter is Jvāleśvara. The third city was
left unconsumed.<sup>5</sup>
[Page2-211+ 38]
<div n="P"/>It is said that at the confluence of the Narmadā with
Kāverī, Kubera practised tapas in honour of Śiva and be-
came the Lord of the Yakṣas. A bath here is equal to that
at the confluence of the Gangā and the Yamunā.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>To the north of the Narmadā are a number of {%tīrthams%}
like Mantreśvara, Garjanā, Amrātaka, Karanyā, Kuṇḍeś-
vara and others. A bath in each of them rids one of all
sins. Then follows other {%tīrthas,%} all equally sacred, includ-
ing Rāvaṇeśvara, the shrines of Kubera, Ahalyātīrtha, and
the shrine of Janārdana. Here Agni, Dharmarāja and
Vāyu practised asceticism and attained emancipation. A
visit to Śuklatīrtham sacred to Rājaṛṣi Cāṇakya washes off
all the sins of a life time. Any gift given here bears rich
fruits.<sup>7</sup>
<div n="P"/>Among the other sacred places can be mentioned the
Bhṛgutīrtham, Kankhala, where Garuḍa once was in
austerities, Kanyātīrtha, Pitāmahatīrtha, and Svargadvāra-
tīrtham; He who reads or listens to the glory of the
Namadā has his wishes fulfilled whatever be his caste.<sup>8</sup> On
its banks Purukutsa heard the {%Viṣṇu Purāṇa%} from the
sages.<sup>9</sup> Penance here by Asuras, who became converted into
Arhats.<sup>10</sup> Marubhūmīviṣaya on the N. ruled by Śūdras and
other castes.<sup>11</sup>
