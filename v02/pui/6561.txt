{%Dharmamūrti%}¦ — a king in the Bṛhatkalpa; a friend of
Indra. His wife was Bhānumatī. He had the prowess to
vanquish even the Asuras. Asked as to the reason of his
strength, his Purohita, Vasiṣṭha explained that in the
previous birth he was a goldsmith in the service of a Śaivite
courtesan, Līlāvatī. She performed the gift of Lavanācala
when he helped her in making up the salt mountain in gold
without receiving anything as wages. The present position
was its consequence. Then he made gifts of ten Merus to
Vasiṣṭha.
