{%Bala%} (I)¦ — a son of Maya residing in Atala; created 96
magical performances some of which are practised even
now; when he yawned, out of his mouth came three groups
of women — Svairiṇī, Kāminī, and Pumścalyā who adminis-
tered Hāṭakarasa to frequenters of those regions and made
them enjoy like Siddhas; resisted Indra in the Devāsura war
and was slain.
