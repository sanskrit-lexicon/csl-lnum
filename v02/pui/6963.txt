{%Nalakūbara%}¦ — a son of Kubera and Ṛddhi; as an
attendant of Rudra became very proud and with his brother
Maṇigrīva enjoyed maidens' embrace on the Ganges, all
naked. Nārada saw this when the ladies put on their dress
while Nalakūbara and his brother continued to remain nak-
ed owing to their drunkenness. The sage cursed them to
become trees for a hundred divine years without losing the
{%Pūrvavāsana.%} So they stood till Kṛṣṇa redeemed them by
bringing down the trees; their prayer to Kṛṣṇa; set out to
the north, permitted by Kṛṣṇa.
