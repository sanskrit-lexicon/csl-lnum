{%Saudāsa%}¦ — also called Mitrasaha and Kalmāṣānghri;
(Kalmāṣapāda-{%Vā. P.%}) son of Sudāsa; wife of Madayantī,
[Page3-702+ 29]
became a Rākṣasa through Vasiṣṭha's curse. Once as he was
hunting, he killed a demon. The latter's brother wanted to
wreak vengeance on the king and in the guise of a cook,
served human flesh to Vasiṣṭha. The sage knew this and
cursed him to be a demon for 12 years. The king wanted
to curse the sage in return but was stopped by his wife. The
consecrated waters fell on his feet and blackened them.
Wandering in the forest, he saw a Brahman couple engaged
in amorous sports. As a demon he seized the Brahman
and ate his flesh despite the lady's protest. She cursed the
demon to meet with death in the sexual act and joined her
husband on his funeral pyre: after 12 years he returned and
longed for union with his queen. She refused remembering
the curse of the Brahmana lady. So he appointed Vasiṣṭha
to beget a son on his queen. As the child was seven years
in pregnancy, Vasiṣṭha hit her stomach with a stone and the
child was born. This was Aśmaka.
