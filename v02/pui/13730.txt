{%Vairājās%} (II)¦ — a class of formless Pitṛs: Fallen from
Yoga, they attain eternal worlds (lokān sanātanān) and are
reborn as Brahmavādins at the end of a day of Brahmā:
they then gain their old memory and by sānkhya and yoga
they attain final release. Their mind-born daughter Menā
is the wife of Himavān.
