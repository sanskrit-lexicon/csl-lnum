{%Kāsīpati%}¦ — see (Kāśirāja): king of Kāsi who went to
aid Pauṇḍraka against Kṛṣṇa and who was so struck that
his head shot into the city; his son together with the priest
prayed to Śiva to avenge his father's murder; Śiva granted
the boon and sent a female created from fire to destroy
Kṛṣṇa whose discus was more than a metal; the dead ran
to Kāśi followed by the discus which burnt the whole city.
<div n="P"/>Vi. V. 34. 14-43.
