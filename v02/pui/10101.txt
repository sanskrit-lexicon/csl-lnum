Matsya Hari during the deluge. After anointing his son
on the throne, M. performed penance on the Malaya Mt.
for a lac of years when Brahmā blessed him as protector of
the universe after the {%pralaya.%} Once in making a water
oblation to his manes, a fish fell into his hand which he
put into his water vessel. Finding its rapid growth he
placed it in a well, tank, Ganges and the sea respectively.
From its abnormal growth he suspected it to be an asura
or Vāsudeva; on questioning it he found it to be the Lord
and was asked to use it (the fish) as the life boat when the
whole world went down in the deluge, saving at the same
time some lives;<sup>5</sup> performed {%tapas%} on the Yamunā for one
hundred years with a view to get progeny;<sup>6</sup> see Satyavrata;

daughter Ilā came out; she became again a male Sudyumna
by name; by an imprecation of Śiva he again became a
woman near Budha's hermitage. Budha got by her a son
by name Purūravas;<sup>10</sup> interpretation of {%Śabdabrahma%} by.<sup>11</sup>
