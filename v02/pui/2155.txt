{%Ṛṣabha%} (VIII)¦ — the son of Nābhi and Sudevī (Meru-
devī according to {%Vi., Vā. & Br. P.%}) An {%avatār%} of Viṣṇu,
eldest of all Kṣatra. A {%Paramahamsa.%} Had a hundred
sons of whom Bharata was the eldest.<sup>1</sup> Nine of these
became rulers of the nine {%dvīpas%} of the world. Eightyone
[Page1-270+ 33]
of them became addicted to {%Karma tantra,%} and the remain-
der nine became sages.<sup>2</sup> Indra grew jealous of him and
stopped rains in his kingdom Ajanābha. But Ṛṣabha, in-
voked rains by yogic powers.<sup>3</sup> As king, married Jayantī,
bestowed on him by Indra, who gave birth to 100 sons.
Under Ṛṣabha, his kingdom flowed with milk and honey.
Once he went to control Brahmāvarta and proclaimed
the importance of self-control and discipline to his
sons and to the world at large. Installed Bharata on
the throne, renounced life and became a wandering
mendicant. Finding the world opposed to his yoga
practice he adopted the vow of a python {%(ājagaram)%}
by which he ate, chewed, drank and passed water all lying
down. By his yogic powers he wandered through Koṅka,
Veṅka, Kuṭaka, S. Karnāṭa, and was consumed by forest-
fire. By listening to his story, devotion to Hari was in-
creased. His path was followed by Sumati;<sup>4</sup> took to the
third {%āśrama%} at Pulaha's hermitage and lived there until
his death.<sup>5</sup>
