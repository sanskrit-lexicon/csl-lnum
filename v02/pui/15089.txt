(poison) administered to his mother by the co-wives of her

<div n="P"/>A Cakravarti. His sons 60,000 in number by Sumati,
excavated the sea and dug all over the earth in their search
for the consecrated horse. Helped by Aurva, he propi-
tiated Hari with sacrifices. Once Indra stole his sacrificial
horse, and this was discovered near Kapila's hermitage in the
N. E. by his sons who imputed the theft to the sage. The
latter burnt them to ashes. But Amśumat, son of Asaman-
jasa got back the horse, and enabled his grandfather to com-
plete the sacrifice. Anointed Amśumat on the throne in the

presence of Paurajānapada and devoted himself to attaining
salvation through the path prescribed by Aurva. Greed for
more territory; conquered Tālajanghas, Yavanas, Śakas,
Haihayas and Barbaras. On the advice of his guru, Vasiṣṭha,
he spared their lives but punished them by disfiguring them — 
some wholly shaven, and some half-shaven. They became
ancestors of Mlecchas and Vrātyas.<sup>1</sup> Realised the yoga power
of Hari.<sup>2</sup> Addressed by him Vasiṣṭha narrated the story of
Paraśurāma. In the case of Haihayas, he conquered the
king and burnt the city. When he invaded the Vidarbhas,
its king sought alliance by offering his daughter in marriage;
was honoured by Śurasenas and Yādavas.<sup>3</sup> During his rule,
nowhere was heard rāja śabdha; ruled like Dharma himself,
maintained castes and orders, earned the title of Aṣṭamaṇḍal-
ādhipati; had an erudite assembly.<sup>4</sup> The jewel of the solar
race. Sumatī brought forth a mass of flesh which ulti-
mately through the blessings of Aurva was converted into
60,000 sons.
