{%Vidura%}¦ — a Kṣetraja son of Vicitravīrya (through the
female servants of the queens of Vicitravīrya-{%Vi. P.%}); a son
of Kṛṣṇadvaipāyana (Vyāsa) and a brother of Dhṛtarāṣṭra.
Yudhiṣṭhira narrated the services done by Vidura to
the Pāṇḍavas from the beginning and asked about
the welfare of Kṛṣṇa and others when Vidura spent some-
time at Hāstinapura. Persuaded Dhṛtarāṣṭra to leave the
capital secretly to the Himālayas for penance, Gāndhārī
following him.<sup>1</sup> Insulted by Duryodhana, Karṇa, and Śakuni
and ordered to be banished. Left Hāstinapura and wander-
ed through the holy places and reaching Prabhāsā, heard of
the establishment of rule by Yudhiṣṭhira. Hearing of the
death of his kinsmen he went back to the Sarasvatī and
performed ablutions at eleven different places sacred to Trita,
Uśanas, etc. Passing through the flourishing Surāṣṭra,
Sauvīra and other countries, he reached the Yamunā and met
Uddhava. Asked him about the welfare of his kinsmen in-
cluding Ugrasena and sons of Kṛṣṇa. Entertained by him
and having heard of the last days of Kṛṣṇa and the Yādavas
and of the fact that Maitreya had been ordered by Kṛṣṇa to
be his preceptor, Vidura left Yamunā for the Ganges where
he met Maitreya.<sup>2</sup> Being addressed, Maitreya said that
Vidura was god Yama incarnate, and gave him a brief
description of the creations and of the knowledge of one god,
and that Hari was the goal. Listened to the story of Uttāna-
pāda and his line, and the discourse on Ātman.<sup>3</sup> Left for
Hāstinapura; having abandoned his relatives came back to
