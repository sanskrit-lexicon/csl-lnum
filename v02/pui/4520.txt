{%Cakrarajarathendra%}¦ — Śrīcakra? Nine sections are dis-
tinguished. In the ninth {%parva%} (section) are ten presiding
deities — the siddhi devis. In a part of this {%parva%} were
stationed the eight Śaktis. Above them were the ten Mudā-
devis or Prakaṭaśaktis. In the eighth {%parva%} there were six-
teen Śaktis named Guptas. In the seventh {%parva%} were six
guptatarās with sugarcane bow, flower dart and flower balls.
In the sixth {%parva%} were the twelve ājñāśaktis. In the fifth
were ten Kulottīrṇa śaktis. In the fourth were ten Nigar-
[Page1-572+ 36]
bhayogini śaktis. In the third were the eight Rahasya-
yogini śaktis. In the second were her favourites three in
number. Where this was, there was Geyaratha and where
the latter was, there was {%kiricakra.%} These three looked like
the three worlds or like the three mountains namely the
Meru, Mandara and the Vindhyas. Lalitā was cakrarāja.
There were six charioteers. Ten yojanas in length, covered
by an umbrella of that height as indication of Lalitā's sām-
rājyam. In the other two, rather ordinary umbrellas were
seen. Viṣaṅga came from rear in disguise, protected by
Kāmeśvarī, the Nityas, Aṇimas and other deities in its ninth
{%parva.%} Kutilākṣa attacked in front. The Nityas kill-
ed all the 15 commanders of Viṣaṅga who fled for
life. This was directed towards the Mahendra hill,
itself in the middle; on its left and right sides the
chariots of Daṇḍiṇi and Śyāmala, rear Sarupadevi and
front Hayāsana: at the gate were stationed 20 akṣauhiṇis with
Stambhini alias Vighnadevi; one hundred akṣauhiṇis to
guard the chariot; all the nine {%parva%} deities shook with fear
seeing the great army following Bhaṇḍa; on its front was
{%geyacakra%} and behind was {%kiricakra;%} there were other śaktis
riding on different animals — lion, camel, deer, elephant, etc.
at the entrance was Jvālāmālinika; the fight began on the
fourth day and ended in complete success; in the neighbour-
hood of Cintāmaṇigraha.
