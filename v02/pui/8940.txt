{%Balāhaka%} (VI)¦ — the first seven sons of Kīkasa, and all
commanders to lead 300 akṣauhiṇis; started against Lalitā's

sun worshippers and obtained the vow that whoever would
see them would be dragged by their bright eyes and would
not see them straight; so they created confusion among the
ranks of the Śakti; Lalitā ordered Daṇḍanātha Tiraskaraṇikā
to create darkness so that the dānavas might not see; it was
done, but its effect was short-lived; and when they were
blinded, their heads were chopped off.
