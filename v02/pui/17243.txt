{%Hariścandra%}¦ — son of Triśanku and Satyaratā. Concern-
ing him there was a battle between Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra
in the disguise of birds for many years. Issueless, and advised
by Nārada, he prayed to Varuṇa for a son, promising to offer
him in sacrifice to the deity. The son was Rohita. Varuṇa
reminded him often about the promised sacrifice, and the
king evaded saying that he was not yet fit for it. Knowing
this Rohita left for forests and the king had a disease maho-
dara: when the boy returned to relieve his father, Indra pre-
vented him from going home. Six years passed and Rohita
purchased Sunaśśepa, the second son of Ajiganta and
returned home. Hariścandra proceeded to offer Sunaśśepa
in sacrifice and was relieved of his disease. Sunaśśepa was
sold as a sacrificial animal to Rohita.<sup>1</sup> Attained permanent
