{%Uddhava%} (I)¦ — a pupil of Bṛhaspati, a friend of Kṛṣṇa,
and a minister of Vṛṣṇis. Requested by Kṛṣṇa, he took a mes-
sage to Nanda and Gopis of Vraja, where he was duly wel-
comed by Nanda. The latter said that he believed with
Garga, Kṛṣṇa and Rāma to be gods when Yaśodā narrated
Kṛṣṇa's exploits as a child. The conversation lasted all
night. After his morning prayers Gopis surrounded him
and asked whether Kṛṣṇa was well and remembered them.
Uddhava was struck with their devotion and told them of
Kṛṣṇa's promised visit in the near future. After spending
some months when Gopis entertained him on {%Kṛṣṇalīlā,%}
Uddhava left for Mathurā.<sup>1</sup> Went with Kṛṣṇa to Sairan-
dhri's house, and to Akrūra's and returned home.<sup>2</sup> Heard
the secrets of Kṛṣṇa's self from him and was a {%Haridāsa.%}<sup>3</sup>
Went with Kṛṣṇa to Dvārakā, and respected him by holding
{%cāmara.%} Kṛṣṇa playing dice with.<sup>4</sup> Consulted by him as to
the method to be adopted in vanquishing Jarāsandha; sug-
gested the performance of {%Rājasūya%} by Yudhiṣṭhira and the

them of his visit.<sup>6</sup> Went to see the Pāṇḍavas at Upaplā-
vyam.<sup>7</sup> Honoured Nanda.<sup>8</sup> A member of the Yādava
{%sabhā.%} Was stationed to defend the E. gate of Mathurā when
it was beseiged by Jarāsandha. Consulted by Kṛṣṇa on the
right detachment of the army.<sup>9</sup> Met Vidura on the Yamunā
and was asked about the welfare of his kinsmen. Touched
deeply by Vidura's query, Uddhava described how the Lord
spent eleven years with Balarāma, Gopas and Gopis, doing
miracles and how he persuaded Nanda to perform {%gosava.%}
He narrated the heroic deeds of Kṛṣṇa and the destruction
of the wicked. Concluded by saying that he would reside

leaving for Prabhāsa, and understanding Kṛṣṇa's mind,
requested him to take him also to His eternal abode. Kṛṣṇa
warned him of the advent of Kali and asked him to go about
always meditating on Hari. In the course of the dialogue
Kṛṣṇa related the conversation between a Yadu and a Brāh-
maṇa ascetic, laying emphasis on how the Brāhmaṇa learnt
lessons from earth, hill, air, sea, archer, pigeon and others
