{%Pratyāhāra%} (I)¦ — the stage of the dissolution or with-
drawal of creation on the commencement of {%Pralaya%} at the
end of Kali; then the primordial spirit {%(avyakta)%} swallows
that which is manifest {%(vyakta):%} waters swallow the {%gan-%}
{%dha%} quality of the earth thus plunging the earth in waters;
then the {%rasa%} quality of the waters gets merged in fire which
spreads in all directions; the {%rūpa%} quality of fire is in turn
eaten away by wind; this permeates all the ten directions,
both above and below; the {%sparśa%} quality of wind is swal-
lowed by {%ākāśā;%} the {%śabda%} (sound) quality of which is over-
whelmed by {%bhūta%} and other gross elements; the great souls
absorb these {%(mahā);%} seven Prakṛtis one covering the
other.
