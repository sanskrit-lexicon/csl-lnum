{%Saura Gaṇa%}¦ — a group of seven in relation to Sūrya,
changing every month. While the sage chants the {%Vedas%} in
his praise, the Gandharva sings, the Apsarasas dance, the
Nāga makes fast his chariot, the Yakṣa makes his chariot and
the Rākṣasa pushes it from behind. Preceding the chariot
the Vālakhilyas move praising his glory.
