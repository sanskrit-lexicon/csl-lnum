{%Vena%}¦ — a son of Anga, of cruel and wrong beha-
viour; fell dead due to the curse of sages who churned his
right arm out of which came Pṛthu; born after {%aśvamedha%}
[Page3-323+ 40]
of his father. The twenty-third Vedavyāsa.<sup>1</sup> Brought up in
the house of his grandfather who was an amśa of Mṛtyu
(adharma) Vena acquired bad conduct, killed his playmates
like animals and became a source of vexation to his father
who left the kingdom in disgust and distress. Vena was
crowned. Blinded by pride he proclaimed that there should
be no more yajñas or gifts in his kingdom. Lost it through
pride of power. He did not listen to the words of sages and
asserted he was the highest of all gods. Seeing him perverse
and vile, the sages slew him; Sunīthā protected his body by
{%mantra.%} To avoid anarchy and to preserve the line of Anga,
the sages churned the thigh of the dead prince and there
came a black dwarfish man, the ancestor of the Niṣādha race.<sup>2</sup>
They continued to churn the two arms out of which came a
male and female child, being the {%amśa%} of Viṣṇu and Lakṣmī.<sup>3</sup>
Thrown into hell by Brāhmaṇas, was saved from hell by
Pṛthu.<sup>4</sup> Pṛthu was the father's part of Vena's body; from
the mother's part of his body came the Mlecchas.<sup>5</sup>
<div n="P"/>Another version: A son of the daughter of Kāla; took to
kāma and covetousness; founded an adharma sthāpana, gave
up Veda śāstras; subjects of, did not learn Vedas or performed
ceremonials or yajñas; made himself the object of sacrifice
and worship; enraged by the ṛṣis led by Marīci who advised
him to take up the right path; ridiculed them and said he was
a mahātmā and could burn the whole world or flood it; hence
the sages held him down and had his left hand churned by
force; there came out a short black figure who stood trem-
bling; the sages said niṣīda, the forerunner of the niṣāda-
vamśa; then they churned his right hand and Pṛthu was born;
Vena died; Pṛthu crowned by all; a good king; his rule and
achievements, including the milking of the earth by all
beings.<sup>6</sup>
