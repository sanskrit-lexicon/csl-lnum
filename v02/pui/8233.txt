{%Pūru%} (III)¦ — a son of Yayāti and Śarmiṣṭhā; agreed to
exchange his youth for his father's old age for a stipulated
period of 1000 years; got back his youth and was anointed
king; progenitor of the Paurava vamśa; father of Janame-
jaya; in his line were Brahmanas, Kṣatriyas and the Bha-
ratas; blessed by Yayātī to have good sons; a legal point was
raised by the members of the Assembly as to the legality
of his succession to the throne when there was the eldest,
Yadu, the grandson of Śukra; Yayāti explained that mere
birth was no qualification for it was character that counted;
the conduct of the eldest son was unsatisfactory and hence
the youngest was chosen; this was approved by the Paura-
