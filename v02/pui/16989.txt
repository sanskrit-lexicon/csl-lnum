{%Syamantaka%}¦ — a jewel presented by the Sun god to Satrā-
jita (s.v.) to enable him to see his form distinctly without be-
ing blinded by his hallow; had the quality of yielding eight
loads of gold every day. Kṛṣṇa thought that Ugrasena was
worthy of having it; knowing this Satrājit gave it to his
brother Prasena. He placed it in a room and hedged it with
divinity. Kṛṣṇa asked for it and was refused. It was taken to
the forest by Prasena whom a lion killed. Jāmbavā killed the
lion and got the jewel. Kṛṣṇa fought with him and recover-
ing the jewel, returned it to Satrājita in a public assembly.
Satrājita offered his daughter in marriage to Kṛṣṇa and
made a gift of the jewel. Kṛṣṇa returned it to Satrājita.
Śatadhanvan killed Satrājita and took it, and placed it with
Akrūra for safe custody. This led to some misunderstand-
ing between Kṛṣṇa and Rāma, and at Kṛṣṇa's request,
Akrūra made it public that it was in his possession.
