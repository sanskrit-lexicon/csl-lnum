{%Reṇukā%}¦ — a daughter of Reṇu (Suveṇu-{%Vā. P.%})
and wife of Jamadagni; mother of Paraśurāma;<sup>1</sup> went
once to the Ganges for a pot of water for {%homa%}
purposes, saw the Gandharva king Citraratha play-
ing with the Apsaras and forgot the time for return-
ing home. Jamadagni understood her mind and in
a rage asked his sons to kill her. All refused but Paraśu-
rāma did it. Later as the result of the boon to his son who
had pleased him by the act she came back to life. During
the absence of Rāma, the sons of Arjuna (Haihaya) killed
Jamadagni in spite of Reṇukā's earnest protests.<sup>2</sup> On Rāma
returning, she cried out beating 21 times on her breast;
liked to die on the funeral pyre when she heard from the air
that her husband would soon be alive. Though she desisted
from it, she died unable to bear her husband's death.<sup>3</sup>
