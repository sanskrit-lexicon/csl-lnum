{%Śaryāti%} (I)¦ — a son of Vaivasvata Manu. A saintly king
who gave a discourse on the second day of Angiraś Yajña.
Father of twins Ānarta and Śukanyā: with the latter he
went once to the āśrama of Cyavana. In an ant-hill the girl
saw two luminous objects and little knowing that they were
the eyes of the sage, she pricked them by a thorn. There was
an overflow of blood and this disabled all the attendants of
the king from answering calls of nature. On enquiry the
king found out the mistake committed by his daughter and
persuaded the sage to excuse her, by offering her in marriage
to him. Taking leave of them he returned to the city.<sup>1</sup>
Desirous of performing a sacrifice, Śaryāti called on the
āśrama of his son-in-law after some time and found a young
man seated on his daughter's side little knowing that the
[Page3-392+ 30]
sage had changed his form due to the blessings of Aśvins:
the king admonished his daughter for her misbehaviour. But
when he heard how Cyavana got back his youth, he was
pleased and hugged his daughter.<sup>2</sup> Father of three sons:
his greed for more territory.
