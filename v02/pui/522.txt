{%Andhaka%} (VI)¦ — the asura killed by Śiva: Āḍi and Baka
were his sons; attempted to abduct the Devī in the presence
of Śiva in the Mahākālavana of Avanti. Smitten by Pāśu-
pata, blood came out of his body, out of which were born
numberless Andhakas (s.v.) who overpowered Rudra. The
latter created a number of {%Mātṛs%} who were not enough to
meet them. Vāsudeva was thought of, and he created one
Śuṣkarevati who drank off the blood of Andhakas. On his
submission he was admitted to the group of Gaṇeśas.
