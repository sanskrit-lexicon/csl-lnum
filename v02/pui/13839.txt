{%Vyāla%}¦ — from the hairs of the head of Prajāpati. ety. ahi,
the vilest of creatures; Pannaga. ety. creeping on the ground;
sarpa, from escaping or fleeting nature; all have their abode
in the earth under the sun and moon; out of anger came viṣa
or poison; then airy beings were created; cūṭas, piśācas from
eating flesh, Gandharvas sucking cows.
