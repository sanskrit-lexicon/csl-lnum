{%Rājeyas%}¦ — the collective name for the hundred sons of
Raji; the latter won over the Asuras and finally established
Indra on the throne and retired for penance; his sons
deprived Indra of his power when the latter appealed to
Bṛhaspati; he increased Indra's strength by rituals and made
the Rājeyas adopt the Jīnadharma and hence got outside
the pale of the Veda, when Indra easily overcame them and
got back his kingdom; beginning of Jīna dharma and hetu-
vāda.
