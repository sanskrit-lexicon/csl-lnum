{%Jagat-sṛṣṭi%}¦ — Evolution of Tattvas, etc. When the Śaktis
did not attend to their function of creation, the Lord with
Śaktikālā entered into twenty-three {%tattvas%} by dividing him-
self into three parts — adhyātma, ādhidaiva, and ādhibhauma
with tenfold prāṇa, Agni as his mouth, Varuṇa as tongue,
Aśvins as nostrils, etc. Then came the four {%varṇas.%} At
first five varieties of Ajñāna were created, viz., andhatāmisra,
tāmisra, mahāmoha, moha, and tamas. Ashamed of these
sinful creations, Brahmā created seers like Sanaka, Sananda,
etc. They also did not proceed with the work of creation
as was desired. So Brahmā grew angry and down came
Rudra from the midst of his eye-brows. He was assigned
places and women. Finding his creation intolerable, Brahmā
sent him away for penance, and produced ten mind-born
sons, Maricī, Atri and others, and a daughter Sarasvatī. Then
came the Vedas and other literature. Further the Creator's
body got into two halves — one Svāyambhuva and the other
Śatarūpa. These were parents of two sons and three
daughters. Their descendants filled up the whole of the
earth. Another account of creation.
