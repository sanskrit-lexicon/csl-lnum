{%Sāvitrī%} (VI)¦ — the daughter of Aśvapati and Mālatī, mar-
ried Satyavān. Nārada spoke to her of his short life: Followed
him to the forest knowing that his end was nearing. Enjoyed
his company seeing the fauna and flora there: saw him un-
conscious when cutting fuel,<sup>1</sup> saw the Lord of death and
begged him on her knees to let him live. Yama granted her
a boon which she would desire. Her first was that her
father-in-law should get back his sight and his kingdom.
Though granted, she pursued Yama to free her husband and
praised the god's glory. She was asked to name another boon
and that was to bless her father with a number of sons. It
was granted. Yama asked her to get back. She did not feel
weary and pursued him. Her third request was to grant
her one hundred sons. Her continuous praise and earnest-
ness pleased the god who restored her husband back to life.
She returned to the place where the body of Satyavān lay,
with him she went home, found Dyumatsena enjoying his
regained eye-sight and people requesting him to take up the
kingship again. Lived long and happy.<sup>2</sup>
