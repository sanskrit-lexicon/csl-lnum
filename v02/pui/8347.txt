{%Pṛṣadhra%} (I)¦ — a son of Vaivasvata Manu. Being
appointed by his teacher to be in charge of cattle he attend-
ed to it zealously. During nights he kept awake in {%vīrāsana%}
posture. On a dark rainy night a tiger entered the stall and
caught hold of a cow, when the other cows ran pell-mell. At
this the prince drew the sword, and in the darkness he cut
off the head of a cow and the ear of the tiger. Next morning
he reported the sad news to the preceptor, who cursed him
to become a śūdra. He however continued to live a life of
celibacy, and detachment to things mundane, ever con-
templating on Hari. He reached Brahmā by entering the
forest-fire in the course of his wanderings.
