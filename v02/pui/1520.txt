{%Indra%} (I)¦ — ({%Sahasrākṣa, Devendra,%} etc.). A {%Lokapāla.%}
He and three other Lokapālas have their cities on the Māna-
sottara mountain in Puṣkaradvīpa;<sup>1</sup> worshipped for vigour
of organs.<sup>2</sup> Served as calf for gods to milk from the Earth.<sup>3</sup>
Presented Pṛthu with a crown.<sup>4</sup> Deprived Pṛthu of his
sacrificial horse during the hundredth {%Aśvamedha.%} Urged by
Atri, Pṛthu's son pursued Indra, when the latter aban-
doned the house and disappeared. A second time Indra
deprived Pṛthu of his horse; when the king's men pursued
him, he left the horse and went away in disguise. This
enraged Pṛthu, who aimed his arrow at Indra but was
pacified by Brahmā in the name of {%dharma.%} A reconcilia-
tion was effected when Pṛthu embraced him.<sup>5</sup> Invested
Vijitāśva with power of moving about unseen by others.<sup>6</sup>
Jealous of Ṛṣabha, refused rains for his kingdom Ajanābha.
Bestowed Jayantī on him.<sup>7</sup> During Hiraṇyakaśipu's absence
at Mandara hill, Indra captured his queen and took her to
his heavenly abode. Nārada intervened and set her at
liberty.<sup>8</sup> Took up his {%vajra%} against Cyavana for allowing
Aśvins to partake of {%soma%} juice. But Cyavana's {%tapas%} tied
down his arms, when Indra yielded.<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>Assumed the form of a bull over which Kakustha rode
and defeated Asuras in a battle. Made the crying Mān-
dhāta suckle his finger.<sup>10</sup> Prevented Rohita from entering
[Page1-188+ 46]
his city for six years: Awarded Hariścandra a golden
chariot after his {%Puruṣamedha.%}<sup>11</sup> Robbed Sagara's sacrifi-
cial horse and left it near Kapila's hermitage.<sup>12</sup> Performed
a sacrifice which was attended by Vasiṣṭha.<sup>13</sup> Joined the
gods in Tārakāmaya war.<sup>14</sup> Asked Gandharvas to take back
Urvaśī living with Purūravas.<sup>15</sup> Helped by Rāji, gave back
his kingdom. After his death, his sons refused to give back
the kingdom, and Indra slew all of them.<sup>16</sup>
<div n="P"/>Cursed by Durvāsa, he lost all fortune. The three
worlds became empty. Varuṇa and other gods conferred
with Brahmā. Finding no means to restore their fortunes,
they repaired to Hari Ajita when Brahmā belauded Hari
as {%mahāvibhūti.%} Hari advised them to secure Bali's
alliance.<sup>17</sup> When the Devāsura war broke out, the gods
fought with Bali who defeated them. At that time Indra
prayed to Hari for help. Encouraged by the latter, the war
was renewed and Bali was defeated. At this Jambha offered
to fight Indra and disabled his elephant. Mātali supplied a
chariot and Jambha's head was cut off. Namuci, Bala and
Pāka attacked Indra. The latter two were slain. Namuci
proved too much for Indra's {%vajra.%} A voice from the sky
told Indra that Namuci could not be crushed by a wet or dry
thing. Then Indra used {%phena%} (foam) and vanquished him.
Bali in the meantime gathered strength and beseiged Indra.
Indra sought counsel of Bṛhaspati who cared for his welfare,
and as advised by the latter, he abandoned the city.<sup>18</sup>
<div n="P"/>Got back Heaven from Vāmana-Hari. He took him to
his abode.<sup>19</sup> Defeated by Arjuna who got the {%sabhā%} made
by Maya. Arjuna for a short time shared his throne.
Defeated by Arjuna at Khāṇḍava. His city visited by
Arjuna in the course of a search for the dead children of
the Dvārakā Brāhmaṇa.<sup>20</sup> Was not able to defeat Nivāta
[Page1-189+ 44]
Kavacas.<sup>21</sup> Afraid of Nara's superior powers, sent Kāma
to spoil his {%tapas;%} was struck with fear with the sage's great-
ness;<sup>22</sup> sent nymphs to disturb Mārkaṇḍeya's {%vrata%} but in
vain.<sup>23</sup> Sheltered Takṣaka and was about to be sacrificed
when Bṛhaspati luckily intervened.<sup>24</sup> Said to be afraid of
the Kurus.<sup>25</sup> Attended Varuṇa's sacrifice and Yudhiṣ-
ṭhira's.<sup>26</sup> For his sake Hari went to Bali in the disguise of
a Brāhmaṇa.<sup>27</sup> Once he sat with Indrāṇī in his {%sabhā%} sur-
rounded by all gods. In his pride he did not welcome his
preceptor Bṛhaspati in the proper way. The latter went
away home at once and concealed himself from the gods.
On this the Asuras attacked the gods. Indra repented and
on Brahmā's advice appointed Viśvarūpa as his preceptor.
Having been initiated into the {%Vidyā Varma Nārāyaṇātma-%}
{%kam,%} he was enjoying his original prosperity. One day
Indra discovered that a part of Viśvarūpa's offerings went to
the Asuras and therefore cut off his head in anger. Thus he
incurred the sin of {%brahmahatyā.%} After a year, in order to
rid himself of it he divided his sin into four parts among
(1) the earth with the boon that dug portion should get
filled up, (2) the waters with the boon of increasing volume
when mixed up, (3) trees with the boon that branches cut
off grow again, and (4) women with the boon of ever
cherishing the passion of love. The saline soil, bubbles and
foam, gum and monthly discharges respectively represent
the {%brahmahatyā%} sin.<sup>28</sup>
<div n="P"/>With {%Vajra%} made of Dadhīci's bones (made by Tvaṣṭr
from sun's {%tejas — Matsya P.%}), Indra attacked Vṛtra as
Rudra attacked Yama. The encounter took place on the
banks of the Narmadā in the first {%Tretāyuga.%} Battle
described. Seeing his friends escaping in fright, Vṛtra en-
couraged them to stand and fight. He also disabled Indra's
Airāvata, and addressed him at length. Indra cut off one
of his arms. With the remaining arm Vṛtra hit Indra while
the {%Vajra%} slipped from his hands causing concern to the gods.
[Page1-190+ 43]
Encouraged by the straight speech of Vṛtra, Indra took up
his {%Vajra%} and cut off his other arm. Vṛtra swallowed him;
but Indra, the vanquisher of Bala, got out of his stomach
and cut off his head. Indra's regret at the murder of another
Brāhmaṇa. The sin of brahmicide, says the legend, took the
disguise of a Caṇḍāla woman and ran towards him in a
terrific form when he entered the lake Mānasa and lived in
the lotus stalks for a thousand years. Invited by Brāhma-
ṇas, he performed an {%Aśvamedha%} and got rid of his sins.<sup>29</sup>
<div n="P"/>Father of three sons Jayanta and others through Pau-
lomī. Getting to know that his mother Diti was observing
a vow to get a child to slay him he offered to do service to
her. Once he found her slack in her duty. He entered the
womb and cut the child into seven pieces and each of these
again into seven. At her request he offered to her to give
them the rank of gods, by name {%Maruts,%}<sup>30</sup> who were allowed
to share in the {%yajñas.%} Diti thought of another son Vajrānga
who bound Indra and placed him before her. Was released
on mediation from Brahmā and Kaśyapa.<sup>30a</sup>
<div n="P"/>Reported to Kṛṣṇa the wicked deeds of Naraka.
Got a gift of {%Maṇiparvata%} of Naraka from Kṛṣṇa.<sup>31</sup> Visited
by Kṛṣṇa and Satyabhāmā. At the latter's wish, {%Pārijāta%}
was removed without any intimation. Indra, induced by
Indrāṇi attacked him with all gods. Kubera, Varuṇa
and others were defeated. Indra himself offered resist-
ance. Garuḍa disabled his elephant and Indra retreated.
Satyabhāmā made fun of him ‘Do not run, Lord of Indrāṇī.’
Indra apologised. Kṛṣṇa answered that Indra was not in
the wrong as he (Kṛṣṇa) took the offensive. Indra asked
pardon and begged that his son Bībhatsu be protected.
Kṛṣṇa told him that {%Pārijāta%} would go back to him when he
left the mortal world. Returned to his city with all gods.<sup>32</sup>
<div n="P"/>The God of rain: Sent torrents of showers on Gokula
when Kṛṣṇa protected his friends by holding up the hill

liated for his own good. In the company of Surabhi, Indra
got Kṛṣṇa bathed with the waters of the Gaṅgā and called
him Govinda. Returned to his region.<sup>33</sup>
