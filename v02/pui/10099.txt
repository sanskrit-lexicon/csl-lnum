{%Manu%}¦ (XII) {%(Svāyambhuva)%} — the first son of Brahmā
and the first king (Samrāṭ) also Virāṭ. Ruled the earth,
girt by seven seas, occupying Brahmāvarta with Barhiṣmatī
as capital. A Viprarājaṛṣi. Learnt the Veda from his father,
who asked him to rule according to Dharma. Wife Śata-
rūpā; sons Priyavrata and Uttānapāda besides eight more
through Anantā and a daughter, Devahūtī. Other daughters
were Ākūti and Prasūti<sup>1</sup> who married Dakṣa and Ruci res-
pectively. Met Kardama on the Sarasvatī, spoke of inter-
dependence of the Kṣatriya and the Brahmana, and offered
his daughter Devahūtī in marriage to that sage.<sup>2</sup> Another
daughter Dhanyā became the wife of Dhruva. Seeing
Dhruva fighting with the Yakṣas in utter wrath, Manu asked
him to cease slaughtering the innocents and to ask pardon
of Kubera, their chief.<sup>3</sup>
<div n="P"/>Appointed Priyavrata in charge of the kingdom and
retired to {%tapas.%} Spent 71 yugas meditating on Viṣṇu, and
gave Him the name, Hari. Did not take objection to Hara's
violation of {%dharma,%} though he was one of the twelve who
knew the {%dharma%} ordained by Hari.<sup>4</sup> Served as calf for
Pṛthu to milk the earth.<sup>5</sup> Formed one half of the Creator
[Page2-620+ 38]
and the other was Śatarūpā. Asked Brahmā for the earth
being lifted out of the waters to form an abode for him and
his subjects, when a Varāha issued from Brahmā's nostrils
to do the work.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>Renouncing the world, Manu stood on one leg medi-
tating on the glory of Hari on the bank of the Sunandā for
a hundred years; when the Asuras tried to attack and devour
him, Hari in the form of {%yajña%} slew them.<sup>7</sup> The first to give
out {%Smārta dharma, Varṇāśrama dharma%} and the first to
practice {%śiṣṭācāra;%} requested by Brahma to protect the
{%Vedas%} and consequently the {%yajñas.%} Divided the Vedas into
four sections.<sup>8</sup> An Ādipuruṣa. From him were born
Vairājas.<sup>9</sup>
