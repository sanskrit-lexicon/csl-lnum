{%Dāruvanam%}¦ — on the Himālayan crests; the abode of
sages in Kṛtayuga engaged in severe austerities; Śiva
appeared before them naked and sometimes wept and some-
times danced; the womenfolk were enchanted by him; the
angry sages cursed him to become an ass and at-
tempted to cut off his {%lingam;%} the Lord disappear-
ed; finding the world beset with difficulties and
dangers the sages appealed to Brahmā and learnt that it was
due to Śiva; hence they made images of {%Linga%} and offered
worship for a year; the Lord appeared before them, and was
praised by all;<sup>1</sup> the sages were treated by Śiva on
Bhasmasnānavidhi.<sup>2</sup>
