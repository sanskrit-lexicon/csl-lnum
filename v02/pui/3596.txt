{%Keśidhvaja%}¦ — son of Kṛtadhvaja and skilled in devo-
tion; banished in hostility Khāṇdikya from his kingdom;
once a tiger slew his milch cow; to find out the {%prāyaścitta%}
he went to consult Kaśeru who sent him to Sunaka and he
commended the name of Khāṇḍikya. So he went to the
forest clad in deer-skin like a religious student and demanded
the form of penance. Khāṇḍikya thought at first that he
had come there to kill him, took up his bow, but laid it
aside; instruction was received and the penance was over.
Keśi felt that some fee was due to Khāṇḍikya and once more
called on him; though his councillors advised him to take
back the kingdom, his mind hankering after the other world;
he requested for his fee for his instruction on the doctrine
of soul; after imparting instruction on {%yoga%} to Khāṇḍikya
retired to a life of peace and attained liberation; father of
Bhānumat.
