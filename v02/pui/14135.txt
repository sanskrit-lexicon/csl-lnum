{%Śambara%} (IV)¦ — a companion of Kamsa; walked away
with child Pradyumna within ten days [six days ({%Vi. P.%})]
of its birth. He knew that the baby was his enemy but he
threw it into the sea and went away. Māyāvatī, the super-
intendent of his kitchen discovered a child in a fish brought
to the kitchen, and hearing from Nārada that it was Kāma
reborn, and that she herself was Ratī, she brought up the
child and when he came of age, she told him the truth and
asked him to fight Śambara with the aid of mahāmāyā vidyā.
His head was cut off by Pradyumna.
