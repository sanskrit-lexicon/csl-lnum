{%Harikeśa%} (III)¦ — a son of Pūrṇabhadra, the Yakṣa; he
became a devotee of Śiva and gave up the svadharma of the
Yakṣas. Hence the angry father banished him. He perform-
[Page3-749+ 27]
ed austerities so severely at Benares for thousands of years
that he was covered over with mud and eaten by ants till he
was reduced to bones. Śiva came to the spot with Pārvatī
and made him Dhanada, the Ganeśvara and Kṣetrapāla; he
was also made Annada. Two Gaṇas Udbhrama and
Sambhrama were given for his service. Then Śiva and
Pārvatī disappeared.
