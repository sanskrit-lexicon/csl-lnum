{#loka#}¦ m. ({#-kaH#}) 1. Man, mankind. 2. A world, a division of the universe;
in general three Lokas are enumerated; viz:--heaven, hell, and
earth: another classification enumerates seven, exclusive of the
infernal regions; viz:--Bhūr-loka the earth, Bhūvar-loka the
space between the earth and the sun, the region of the Munis,
Siddhas, &c.; Swar-loka the heaven of INDRA, between the sun
and the polar star; Mahar-loka the usual abode of BHRIGU, and
others saints, who are supposed to be co-existent with BRAHMĀ:
during the conflagration of these lower worlds, the saints ascend
to the next, or Jana-loka, which is described as the abode of BRAH-
MĀ'S sons, SANAKA, SĀNANDA, SANĀTANA, and SANATKUMĀRA;
above this, is the fifth world or the Tapo-loka, where the deities called
Vairāgis reside; the seventh world, Satya-loka or Brahma-loka,
is the abode of BRAHMĀ, and translation to this world exempts
beings from further birth: the three first worlds are destroyed at
the end of each Kalpa or day of BRAHMĀ; the three last at the
end of his life, or of 100 of his years; the fourth Loka is equally
permanent, but is uninhabitable from heat, at the time the three
first are burning: another enumeration calls these seven worlds,
[Page621-a+ 60]
earth, sky, heaven, middle region, place of births, mansion of the
blest, and abode of truth, placing the sons of BRAHMĀ in the
sixth division, and stating the fifth or Jana-loka to be that,
where animals destroyed in the general conflagration are born
again. The seven lower regions descending from the earth one
below the other are:--ATALA, BITALA, SŪTALA, RASĀTALA,
TALĀTALA, MAHĀTALA, PĀTĀLA, respectively. 3. The human race.
4. The earth. 5. The subjects. 6. A class, a community. 7. A
region. 8. The number “seven.” 9. Common life, or usage, (oppo-
rite to Shāstra and Veda respectively.) 10. Sight, seeing. 11. An
element, a primary or radical part of being. E. {#lok#} to see, aff. {#GaY .#}
