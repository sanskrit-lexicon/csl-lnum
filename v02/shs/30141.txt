{#maRqaleSvara#}¦ m. ({#-raH#}) A sovereign, a monarch. E. {#maRqala#} a district, and {#IScara#}
<>a sovereign; the power of this prince is limited by AMARA, and
<>the Mandaleswara is considered as an emperor or supreme prince,
<>only when in addition to his territorial sway, he has performed
<>the Rājasuya sacrifice, in which he has been attended by all his
<>tributary or subject princes: other authorities confound the so-
<>vereign of a Mandala, with the Chakravarti or emperor, and with
<>the Samrāj or lord paramount, and others confine him to the
<>government of a district of twenty or forty Yojanas in each
<>direction.
