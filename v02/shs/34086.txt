{#laNkA#}¦ f. ({#-NkA#}) 1. The capital of RĀVAṆA in Ceylon; the name is ex-
tended also to the island, which according to the notions of the
Hindus, is much more considerable in size, and lies further from
the continent than in reality; it is described as being equal to
one-twelvth of the equatorial circumference of the earth, and is
one of the places lying under the first meridian, whence the
longitude is computed; it is thus placed in the Eastern ocean,
South of Ceylon, and according to WILFORD is the peninsula of
Malacca: according to some Hindu accounts also, it is distinct
from Ceylon, from which island Lankā is said to be just visible.
2. A goddess or evil spirit, one of the Śākinīs, perhaps the same
as the tutelary deity of the city of Lankā. 3. An unchaste woman.
4. A branch. 5. A kind of grain. E. {#lak#} to obtain, (happiness, in
which,) aff. {#ac,#} and {#num#} irr. augment.
