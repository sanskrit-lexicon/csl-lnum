{#saM#}¦ Ind. (In composition,) With, together with, &c.; being the optional
<>form of writing {#sam#} before a consonant: before consonants of the
<>first five classes, the Anuswāra may be again changed to the
<>nasal of the class to which the letter it preceds belongs, as {#saM#} for
<>{#sam#} and {#kalpa#} make {#saNkalpa,#} &c.: before the semi-vowels, the sibilants,
<>and {#ha,#} it preferably remains unaltered; this practice however is
<>very arbitrary in this respect and the change is expressed or not,
<>in all manuscripts according to the pleasure of the writer.
