{#sTAlIpulAkanyAya#}Â¦ m. ({#-yaH#}) The maxim of the cooking-pot and the boiled-
rice. In a cooking-pot all the grains are equally moistened by the
heated water and so when one knows that one grain is well-cooked
he can draw the same inference as regards all others. From this
fact the maxim is applied to cases where the condition of the whole
is inferred from that of a part.
