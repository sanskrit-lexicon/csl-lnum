and mother of PARAŚURĀMA; once she saw the Gandharba-king
CHITTRARATHA sporting with his queen and felt envious of their
felicity. Defiled by unworthy thoughts she returned disquieted to
her home. JAMADAGNI seeing her fallen from sanctity, was enraged
and ordered his sons to cut off her head; and one of them PARA-
SŪRĀMA with explicit obedience to his father's command beheaded
her; but her husband was so much pleased with the dutifulness
of his son that he restored her to life at the request of his son
PARASŪRĀMA. 3. A sort of pulse, (Ervum or Cicer lens.) E. {#reRu#}
