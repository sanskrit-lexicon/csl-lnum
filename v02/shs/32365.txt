{#yajus#}¦ n. ({#-juH#}) The Yajur or Yajush, one of the four Vedas; it is di-
vided into two principal portions, the white and black, or Vāja-
saneyi and Taittirīya, the former of which is attributed to the
saint YĀJNAWALKYA, to whom it was revealed by the sun, in
the form of a horse; and the latter to TAITTIRI, to whom it
was communicated by YĀSKA, the first pupil of its original
author, the sage VAIŚAMPĀYANA: according to the Purāṇas
the Taittirīya portion was named from Tittiri a partridge;
the disciples of VAIŚAMPĀYANA being changed into those birds,
to pick up the texts of the Veda as they were disgorged in a
tangible shape by YĀJNAWALKYA, at the command of VAIŚAM-
PĀYANA: both portions of this Veda are very full on the sub-
ject of religious rites, and the prayers peculiar to it, are chiefly
in measured and poetical prose. E. {#yaj#} to worship, Unādi aff. {#usi .#}
