{#pfzodara#}¦ mfn. ({#-raH-rA-raM#}) Having a spot or circle on the belly. According
to Professor Turkabāchaspati:--{#pfzaH divodaraM yasya pfzo0 talopaH#} 1. Small-
bellied, and {#pfzanti udare yasya#}. 2. Air, wind. But in his other works
this word is taken as a type of such irregular compounds. Accor-
ding to others:--E. {#pfzat#} a drop of any thing liquid, and {#udara#} the
belly, form irregular and special; the word is most commonly in
use as a grammatical term, being the leading word of a class in
which the formation of each is peculiar to itself, and being thence
applied to designate the rule which comprehends the whole of
the series.
