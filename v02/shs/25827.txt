<>to Professor Turkabāchaspati:--{#pfzaH divodaraM yasya pfzo0 talopaH#} 1. Small-
<>bellied, and {#pfzanti udare yasya#}. 2. Air, wind. But in his other works
<>this word is taken as a type of such irregular compounds. Accor-
<>ding to others:--E. {#pfzat#} a drop of any thing liquid, and {#udara#} the
<>belly, form irregular and special; the word is most commonly in

<>which the formation of each is peculiar to itself, and being thence
<>applied to designate the rule which comprehends the whole of
<>the series.
