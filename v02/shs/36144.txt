{#vAlmIka#}¦ m. ({#-kaH#}) VĀLMĪKA or VĀLMĪKI, the first poet and the famous
<>author of the Rāmāyaṇa. Though a Brāhmana by birth he led
<>a depraved life and was a notorious cut-throat, but was reclaimed
<>by Nārada. One day while he was engaged in his devotions, he
<>saw a fowler in the act of shooting at a pair of curlews and a
<>curse fell from his mouth in the shape of a regular stanza. The
<>sage discovered that it was a new mode of composition and by
<>the advice of BRAHMĀ he composed the Rāmāyaṇa in that style.
<>SITĀ when repudiated by her husband, took refuge with this
<>sage who brought up her twin sons. E. {#valmIka#} an ant-hill, aff. {#aR,#}
<>or with {#iY#} aff. {#vAlmIki;#} so immersed in abstraction as to be
<>overrun with ant's nests.
