{#vAlmIka#}¦ m. ({#-kaH#}) VĀLMĪKA or VĀLMĪKI, the first poet and the famous
author of the Rāmāyaṇa. Though a Brāhmana by birth he led
a depraved life and was a notorious cut-throat, but was reclaimed
by Nārada. One day while he was engaged in his devotions, he
saw a fowler in the act of shooting at a pair of curlews and a
curse fell from his mouth in the shape of a regular stanza. The
sage discovered that it was a new mode of composition and by
the advice of BRAHMĀ he composed the Rāmāyaṇa in that style.
SITĀ when repudiated by her husband, took refuge with this
sage who brought up her twin sons. E. {#valmIka#} an ant-hill, aff. {#aR,#}
or with {#iY#} aff. {#vAlmIki;#} so immersed in abstraction as to be
overrun with ant's nests.
