peculiar and mystical formulæ and rites for the worship of the
deities, or the attainment of superhuman power: it is mostly in the
form of a dialogue between SIVA and DURGA, who are the peculiar
gods of the Tantrikas: there is a great number of these works, and
their authority, in many parts of India, seems to have, in a great
measure, superseded that of the Vedas: according to one account,
a Tantra comprises five subjects, the creation and destruction of
the world, the worship of the gods, the attainment of all objects,
magical rites for the acquirement of six (superhuman) faculties,
and four modes of union with spirit by meditation; a variety of
subjects are, however, introduced many of them, whilst some are
limited to a single topic, as the mode of breathing in certain rites,
the language of birds, beasts, &c. 2. A branch of the Vedas, that
