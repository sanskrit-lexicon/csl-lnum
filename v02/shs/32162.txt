{#meru#}¦ m. ({#-ruH#}) 1. The sacred mountain Meru, in the centre of the seven
continents, compared to the cup or seed-vessel of the lotus, the
leaves of which are formed by the different Dwipas: its height
is said by the Hindus to be 84,000 Yojanas, sixteen thousand
of which are below the surface of the earth: the shape is various-
ly described, as square, conical, columnar, spherical, or spiral;
and the four faces of it are of various colours, or white towards
the east, yellow to the south, black to the west, and red towards
the north: the river Ganges falls from heaven on its summit,
and flows thence to the surrounding worlds in four streams; the
southern branch is the Ganges of India, the northern running into
Tartary is the Bhadrasomā, the eastern is the Sitā, and the wes-
tern the Chacshu or Oxus: on the summit of Meru BRAHMĀ re-
sides attended and worshipped by the Rishis, Gandharbas, &c.;
the regents of the points of the compass occupy the correspond-
ing faces of the mountain, the whole of which consists of gold and
gems: considered in any but a fabulous light, mount Meru
appears to mean the high land of Tartary, immediately to the
north of the Himālaya mountains. 2. The central bead in a rosary.
3. The middle gem in a necklace. E. {#mi#} to scatter, (radiance,)
Unādi aff. {#ru#}.
