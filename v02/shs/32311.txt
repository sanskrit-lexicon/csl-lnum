search and similarity of appellation may be trusted, the tribes of
Mlechchhas are as follows: the Pauṇḍrakas, (the people of pro-
vinces bordering on Bengal and Bihar, and to the south of the
Ganges,) Oḍras, (Urīyās,) Drāviras, (people of the southern part
of the Coromandel coast,) Cāmbojas, (Arachosians,) Yavanas,
(Greeks or Bactrians,) Śakas, (the people of the Sacha region or
Sakai,) Pāravas, (Paropamisans,) Pahlavas, (the ancient Persians,)
Chīnas, (Chinese,) Kirātas, (generally mountaineers, here per-
haps especially the inhabitants of the Himālaya or Imaus,) Dera-
das, (Daradæ,) and Khasas, (Scuthi or Chasas.) n. ({#-cCaM#}) Copper. E.
