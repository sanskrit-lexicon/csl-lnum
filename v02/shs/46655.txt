{#hariScandra#}¦ m. ({#-ndraH#}) A sovereign, the twenty-eighth of the solar dynasty
in the second age, celebrated for his piety and liberality, and who
on those accounts was elevated, together with his subjects, to
heaven: having been insidiously induced by NĀRADA, to relate
his actions with unbecoming pride, he descended from Swarga, a
stage at each sentence, till stopping in time, and doing homage to
the gods, he was fixed with his capital in mid-air. E. {#hari#} VISHṆU,
{#candra#} the moon.
