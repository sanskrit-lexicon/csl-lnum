{#yayAti#}¦ m. ({#-tiH#}) A monarch of India the fifth of the lunar race and son
of NAHUSA. At first he married Devajāni, the only child of SŪKRA,
the preceptor of the demons and subsequently ŚARMISHṬHĀ the
daughter of VRISHAPARVAN, who was ordered by her father to attend
on Devajāni as a servant, as a punishment for her throwing her in
a well. For his marrying and making love to ŚARMISHṬHĀ Yajāti
became old and infirm before his time through the curse of SUKRA,
but having appeased his father-in-law obtained permission to
transfer his decrepitude to any one who would consent to take it.
Out of his five sons PURU complied with his father's wishes. The
King being endowed with renovated youth, passed his time in
the enjoyment of pleasures for a full thousand years, and after
which he restored his youth to PURU and resuming his own de-
crepitude departed to the wood of penance. E. {#yasya vAyoriva yAti-#}
