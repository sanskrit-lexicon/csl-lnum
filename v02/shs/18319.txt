{#dakzADvaraDvaMsakft#}Â¦ m. ({#-kft#}) A name of SIVA. E. {#dakza#} the Bramhadika, as
DAKSHA, {#aDvara#} a sacrifice, {#DvaMsakft#} subduer or disturber: DAKSHA
having on one occasion made a sacrifice, to which he invited all
the gods, except his son-in-law SIVA, and his wife SATI, the latter
went unbid, and being received coolly, threw herself into the fire;
This being informed siva, tore off a lock of his hair and cast it vio-
lently on the ground. It started up into being a demon named
Birbhadra who being ordered by siva proceeded against DAKSHA,
and an affray ensued, in which the gods and Rishis were maltreated
and dispersed, and DAKSHA decapitated; he was restored to life,
and the head of a ram substituted for the one he had lost.
