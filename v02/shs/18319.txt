<>DAKSHA, {#aDvara#} a sacrifice, {#DvaMsakft#} subduer or disturber: DAKSHA
<>having on one occasion made a sacrifice, to which he invited all
<>the gods, except his son-in-law SIVA, and his wife SATI, the latter
<>went unbid, and being received coolly, threw herself into the fire;
<>This being informed siva, tore off a lock of his hair and cast it vio-
<>lently on the ground. It started up into being a demon named
<>Birbhadra who being ordered by siva proceeded against DAKSHA,
<>and an affray ensued, in which the gods and Rishis were maltreated
<>and dispersed, and DAKSHA decapitated; he was restored to life,
<>and the head of a ram substituted for the one he had lost.
