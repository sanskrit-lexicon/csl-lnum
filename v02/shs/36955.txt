{#vinDyakUwa#}¦ m. ({#-waH#}) The saint AGASTYA. E. {#vinDya#} the mountain, and {#kUw#} to
give pain, aff. {#ka,#} or with {#yuc#} aff. {#vinDyakUwana;#} Vindhya the personi-
fied mountain, having once prostrated himself before AGASTYA
his spiritual guide, was ordered by the saint to remain in that
posture, as a punishment for the presumption, which had in-
duced him to attempt rivalling the heighth of Meru and Himā-
laya. The legend appears to originate in the little elevation of the
Vindhya-chain compared with its extent.
