{#samAnodaka#}¦ m. ({#-kaH#}) A kinsman, one who when distinct from the
Sapiṇḍa is next in order and succession, and is connected by
oblations of water only, to the manes of common ancestors; this
relationship extends to the fourteenth in descent, i. e. the seven
first or Sapiṇḍas presenting water as well as the cakes, are also
Samānodakas, whilst the seven next presenting water alone are
Samānodakas only. E. {#samAna#} common, {#udaka#} water.
