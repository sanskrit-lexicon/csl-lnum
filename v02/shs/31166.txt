{#mAkzi (kzI) ka#}¦ n. ({#-kaM#}) 1. A mineral substance, of which two kinds are des-
cribed; the {#svarRamAkzika#} or gold Mākshika, of a bright yellow colour,
apparently the common pyritic iron ore: and the {#rUpyamAkzika#} or
silver Mākshika, which answers in appearance to the Hepatic py-
rites of iron; other names of these ores occur; as {#viwmAkzika#} and
{#kAMsyamAkzika,#} or feculent Mākshika and mixed metal Mākshika
they are however, perhaps rather synonymes of the gold and
silver ore, respectively, than names of distinct species. 2. Honey.
E. {#makzikA#} a bee, {#aR#} aff. of derivation; the name is applied to the
ore, from its honey-like colour.
