{#pUrvvamImAMsA#}¦ f. ({#-sA#}) An inquiry into the ritual portion of the Veda. It is
called {#pUrvvamImAMsA#} in contradistinction to the Vedānta system which
is considered to be a sequel to Jaimini's system and is styled {#uttara#}
{#mImAMsA;#} there is however very little in common between the two
systems.
