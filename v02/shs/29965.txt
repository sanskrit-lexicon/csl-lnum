{#makara#}Â¦ m. ({#-raH#}) 1. A marine monster, confounded usually with the
crocodile and shark, but properly a fabulous animal: as a fish it
might be conjectured to be the horned-shark, or the unicorn fish;
but it is often drawn, as it in the pictured sign Capricornus of the
zodiac, with the head and forelegs of an antelope, and the body
and tail of a fish: it is the emblem of the god of love. 2. One of
the signs of zodiac, corresponding with the above, and like
the Greek representation of that sign, being an animal in
the foreparts, and ending in the tail of a fish. One of the nine
treasures of KUVERA. 3. A particular array of troops, in the form
of a Makara. 4. An ear-ring in that shape. E. {#ma#} for {#muKa#} the mouth,
{#kf#} to scatter, aff. {#ac;#} or {#mAN#} prohibitive aff., {#kf#} to do, {#ac#} aff.,
form irr.; grammarians however, sometimes consider this word
as a primitive.
