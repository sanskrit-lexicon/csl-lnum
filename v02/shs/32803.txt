{#yoga#}¦ m. ({#-gaH#}) 1. Junction, joining, union. 2. Combination, association,
meeting, conflux. 3. Religious and abstract meditation. 4. Keep-
ing the body in a fixed posture. 5. Devotion, spiritual worship of
GOD, or union with the Supreme Being by means of abstract
contemplation; this does not necessarily imply an abandonment
of the world or relinquishment of the usual observances of re-
ligion, but it involves internal indifference to objects of pleasure
and pain, and utter disregard of the consequences or fruit of
ceremonial rites. 6. The particular practice of the preceding sort
of devotion, or the exercise of that abstraction by which union
with God is supposed to be obtained; in the Gītā it is described
as sitting on Kuśa grass, with the body firm, the eyes fixed on
the tip of the nose, and the mind intent on the Deity; in the Tan-
tras a fanciful operation is prescribed, by which the vital spirit sea-
ted in the lower part of the body, and the etherial spirit placed in
the head, are supposed to be brought into combination in the
brain, when the devotee becomes united with BRAHMĀ. 7. The sys-
tem of philosophy which treats of the union of the soul with BRAH-
MĀ or GOD; it is the same as the Patanjalī doctrine, and consti-
tutes one of the six Darshanas or philosophical schools of the
Hindus. 8. Magic, or the acquisition of supernatural powers by the
mystical and magical worship of ŚIVA and DURGĀ especially. 9.
Consequence, result, the main end or object of any thing or act.
10. Connection of one thing with another, as of cause with effect,
predicate with subject, quality with substance, &c. 11. Acquisi-
tion of something not possessed before, accession of property or
wealth; in grammar this application is assigned to any unusual
construction of words or compounds, unauthorised by rule, but
sanctioned by the authority that employs them. 12. A rule, an
aphorism. 13. Propriety, fitness. 14. Side, part, cause or argument
to be maintained or defended. 15. Thing, substance. 16. Wealth.
17. A drug, a medicament, especially a compound of various, in-
gredients. 18. Fraud, trick. 19. A logician. 20. A spy, an informer.
21. A violator of truth or confidence. 22. A conveyance, a carriage,

28. (In astronomy,) The leading or principal star of a lunar man-
sion. 29. The twenty-seventh part of 3600 of a great circle measur-
ed on the plane of the ecliptic, and used in calculating the longitu-
des of the sun and moon; each Yoga has a distinct name; as-
trologers also enumerate twenty-eight Yogas differently named
from the foregoing, and corresponding with the twenty-eight Nak-
shatras, or the divisions of the moon's path, but varying accor-
ding to the day of the week. 30. A period, or the time during
which the sum of the motions of the sun and moon amount to one
Nakshatra, the mean duration of which is 23hs. 474 4444. E. {#yuj#}
