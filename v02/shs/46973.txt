{#himAlaya#}¦ m. ({#-ya#}) The Himālaya range of mountains,
which bounds India on the north, and separates it from Tartary;
the Imaus and Emodus of the ancients, giving rise to the Ganges,
and Indus, and many other considerable rivers, and containing
the highest elevations in the world: in mythology, the mountain
is personified as the husband of MENAKĀ, and the father of
GANGĀ or the Ganges, and DURGĀ or UMĀ in her descent as
PĀRVATĪ, the mountain nymph, to captivate ŚIVA, and withdraw
him from a course of ascetic austerity practised in those regions.
E. {#hima#} cold, or frost and snow, and {#Alaya#} abode.
